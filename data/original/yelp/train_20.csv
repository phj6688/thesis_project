5,"Stopped by here for lunch today... I saw the Burger sign outside and thought I would try it out. WOW!! This place is amazing. The owner/chef was taking the orders and was super helpful and friendly. I had a Paradise CHZ which came with 2 patties, smoked mozzarella lettuce, tomato, caramelized onion as well as cucumber. I also ordered  Sweet Potato Tater Tots I was blown away! BEST BURGERS IN PHOENIX!  Our bill came to $18 for 2 cheese burgers, 2 sides and a soda.  It was so amazing I went back for dinner. I bragged to much when I got home that my boyfriend just had to try it. I had the special which was a Roasted Duck Burger (2 beef patties, topped with roasted duck, caramelized onions, bacon, fried egg over easy served with duck au jus) By far the best burger of my life. My boyfriend got the Beach House (2 beef patties. roasted green chili, smoked mozzarella, pico de gallo and jalapeno ranch) He also ordered the seasoned fries. I dont care for fires and I think I could eat 3 orders they were so good. His was so good he ordered another burger.  For Desert we shared a Maple Pecan Bacon Milkshake, also to die for. I really think I need one of these every night. From the atmosphere, the music, the staff to the food every thing about PV Burgers was a hit. This is a must go!"
5,"I have been living in Arizona for 4 years and have yet to find a decent Italian Beef Sandwich, until now.  I even gave the same statement to the owner.  I had ordered an Italian Beef for carry out, and while I was waiting, I let him know my frustrations.  He gave me his card and told me to call him after I ate the sandwich because he wanted to know what I thought.  Well, it was FANTASTIC!  Of course, I called him back to let him know.   The service, and the time and effort put into the food cannot be beat.  This is what you get for a mom and pops type place.   There are plenty of other sandwiches and foods there too.  I cant wait to go back and try some more!"
4,"Wow! what a great meal last night. Kinda nervous to go back after being there a cpl of years ago for lunch and not loving it. BUTTTTT 2 words: Boiled Wontons. Order these and u will prob crave them for days. Spicy broth with boiled wontons in a light peanut sauce. I also ordered my fave, Peking duck. Very impressed with the quality and will be going back more. They do bring the food out superman fast so you kinda feel rushed but other than that, i see why they are sooo packed."
5,"Been here twice now and wish I could say more. The food is delicious, the set up is really relaxing and service is great. A great place to take an out of town guest. Happy hour menu has these amazing tofu tacos that I highly recommend. My boyfriend had the Pork tacos which he said were also delish. Definitely check this place out!!"
4,"Ive been here twice now for the lunch buffet and the second time I even brought a friend who was a foodie and both times it was great. They have a great selection of dips on the buffet, a few salads and many warm entrees to choose from.  I recommend taking a little bit of everything and if you follow my rule, you wont be disappointed. Everything is absolutely delicious and youll have fun guessing the spices in the various dishes.  If youre in the mood for some tasty middle eastern food, I would really recommend it. Its a little short on ambiance, but with flavors like that, whos looking anywhere but their plate?"
5,"We happened upon this location when meeting a friend for dinner.  When I showed up there was a line of about 20 people ahead of me.  i asked them to put me in first available and they said 15-20min and then 45min for a booth. Ok, Ill wait. Our friends showed up and my girlfriend had asked if there was a spot at the bar we could sit in the mean time.  We were there for about 10min already.  Thats when she said to us. ""Your table inside is ready""  she walked us right there and we were sat.  WOW!  that was quick! We ordered drinks and food.  I got these jerk chicken wings for an appetizer and holy cow, they were delicious.  For my main dish I ordered a garlic noodle dish.  It definitely hit the spot.  My only beef would be that it was hard to talk with so many people inside.  I wont let that affect the rating though. Awesome place!"
5,"We were here on Wednesday, 12/21/11. We had been at a Rubios in CA recently and was extremely disappointed. Not this time! Jacob was our order taker and was VERY courteous and professional.  My husband got two fish tacos that were a good size and yummie. I went with the grilled veggie burrito and man, it was huge and tasty! This is what Rubios is about!"
4,"This place is very cool! I went here after work with a sorority sister for drinks on a Friday night. Ended up staying for like 3.5 hours. Fantastic atmosphere with outdoor and indoor seating. Lighting is dim and intimate indoors with rustic seating areas and large booth perfect for groups getting drinks together. The outdoor patio is sectioned off in a covered area with tables and smaller seats while an uncovered area hosted seating for peeps who rode their bikes in. The drinks are pretty yummy. If youre into fruity, girly cocktails there isnt much to choose from, but for a more mature, grown-u beverage, youre in luck. Hit the happy hour (which sadly ends at 5pm). It gets a tad loud and it difficult to tell the wait staff apart from the customers because theyre all in street clothes but theyre very attentive and sweet. We ordered the fondu plate and it was great. Pretzels, sausage, apples and the cheese... perfect for sobering up a bit from those yummy cocktails."
3,"Best time to work out at this gym is in the early morning.  Went in the afternoon a few times and its usually packed.   This place has everything I need to work out. (threadmill, free weights, machines, basketball court, swimming pool, and sauna).  Rarely do I see any of the machines out of order/ broken.  Although the mens sauna bench was broken for maybe 2-3 months before they finally fixed it."
5,"Stopped in for Margs and appetizers. Had 2 house Margaritas......AM I DRUNK? Holy MOLY what do they put in those things? Food was great, drinks were better, Ill be back!"
5,"As much of a sweet tooth that i have (dark decadent chocolate is my weakness)..Toffee was never my thing ,never on my mind .. And then i sampled Goodytwos toffee ..wowzer ! Sweet and salty toffee is regoddamndiculously good ..seriously good ! They have a toffee topped popcorn ..these gals are killing me ..oh ,oh the twozels sinfully delish magical pretzel mix with kettle corn ,nuts and chocolate . Listen ,you cant put a price on happiness ,ha ha  Everyone i love is getting their stockings stuffed with a box of salty-sweet love from Goodytwos. Nothing more delicious or sexy ,ya sexy then a salty sweet combo ..it is a heavenly pairing ..Goodytwos has perfected this,worth every penny ! Rock on ladies !"
4,"I have had the opportunity to watch games at the Staples Center, and Honda Center in Los Angeles and Anaheim. Both are great arenas and are very fan friendly. Jobing.com is totally different, and thats not a bad thing! I really enjoy the arena is in the same complex with restaurants and movie theater. Great place to hang out before and after the game. Parking is great, I actually had a parking pass and did not use it. I just parked at the west gate parking lot. The arena was very easy to acess, and we had a great time. We will be coming back many more times."
4,"I eat here at least once every week since its close to my office, and they are always quick, tasty and reasonably priced.   I usually get one of the lunch specials (even the Chinese-sounding dishes have a Thai flair, especially if you order them with extra spice), but if youre hungry the house special chicken is well worth the extra buck, as are the Thai noodle dishes (the pad see ew is my favorite).   The wait staff is always friendly, the food is always quick, good and reasonably priced.  i havent had a bad experience in several dozen visits, and ill continue to call myself a regular."
4,"So im not here to buy spices or shop for sheesha, im here for food. Lots and lots of food. Luckily for me, Haji-Baba is known for tons of food at decent prices so I have a promising evening of stuffing my face without breaking my wallet. God, I sound like a really cheap buffet commercial. But really, to be truthfully, super blunt, honest-to-go-honest truth, Haji-Babas food is not the best in the world but it is 1) fresh, 2) good quality, 3) tasty and 4) cheap. I am sure you can find better Mediterranean food around town, but this place is really good on your wallet and fits my needs just right. And hey, 215 reviews cant be lying. THE PEOPLE LIKE IT. They like it a lot. I ordered the gyro deluxe (gyro with raw onions and feta cheese), a side order of hummus, Babaganoush (eggplant dip), tried my friends lamb tongue and a pistachio  baklava.  If you are feeling adventurous and want to try the lamb tongue, lemme tell you: dont. Really, dont. There is nothing tasty about lamb tongue. It tastes slightly like roast beef but the texture resembles congealed liver patee and the big chunks are really scary. The only positive about eating tongue? Infinite pun jokes about talking about it forever. Get it? The gyro meat was pretty standard in the Gyro deluxe sandwich, the best thing about it was the creamy fresh salty feta cheese. Its the freshest ive ever had and they really DO slap it on that sandwich, like a boss. The babaganoush was also very very tasty with the pickle and the black olive- however- i would have liked bigger pieces of roasted eggplant than a hummus-like texture. The hummus was just A-OK, it needed more of a PUNCH of flavor. Last but not least, the baklava is my favorite dessert in all the land.. so obviously I enjoyed it. Heavy on the honey and not very crispy on the nuts, but pretty decent nonetheless. In conclusion, only use the tongue in your mouth and not the one on the menu, get as much feta cheese as your body can process and buy a desert to-go. BAM, lunch is served."
5,"I LOVE this place! From the moment you walk up to the door, it is spotless. Sometimes you will be approached by an employee asking if you need assistance, majority of the time, you wont talk to one employee, which is great! I just want to go in, get what I need, and peace out until next time without the small chatter.  Their hummus is AMAZING, along with a few of the prepackaged meals. Their Creamy Cilantro Salad Dressing is OMG AMAZING!! Sweet tea... LOVE IT!!"
5,"Oh my gooooooooodness!  I love this store.  I have been a tea enthusiast ever since I received a cast iron tea pot for Christmas.  A few weeks ago, I purchased a Groupon for $20 worth of merchandise for $10 and headed over to the store.  The experience was amazing.  The varieties were intriguing, the prices were reasonable, and the owner was very knowledgeable and friendly.  Also, the layout of the store was appealing and inviting.   When we visited the store, we received a packet of tea for the stores 1st birthday.  I hope there will be many more to come."
4,"I was surprised to see that this place has such low ratings on yelp- it is one of my favorite Mexican places in the valley.  Favorite dishes include: mini beef tacos, Tapopo Salad (iceberg lettuce, cheddar cheese, chicken, peas, corn, beans, tomatoes and large amount of quacamole under it all), fresh salsa, and Tacos Al Carbon. All freshly prepared and wonderful tasting. If you have kids, ask to sit in the blue room by the fish tank - the decor is fun and mysterious and will keep young children distracted thru the entire meal."
5,"Marcellino and Sima are finally back after their yearly 1 month Italy vacation (re-opened September 10th)....and are we glad they are back!   We had a fabulous duo appetizer: fresh fig and prosciutto and the second was a filet (carpaccio) with shaved mushroom and black truffle!  Delicious!  Ive always been a fan of prosciutto and melon, but the fresh fig was tremendous! Marcellino also brought us a fresh black truffle cream for his crusty bread, mmmm, amazing.  I dont think you can get this anywhere (fresh), even here if you ask for it, but we were lucky to be in the right place at the right time! Pasta duo was tortellini with even more truffles and a wild boar pappardelle.  Best hand made pastas anywhere.  Perfect! Main course was a perfectly cooked filet with his mashed potatoes and julienned vegetables...and more truffles!  So right...so full!  Im so glad we had an hour spinning class before embarking on this journey! We ended up skipping desert and had some left over to go!  What a perfect Italian dinner paradise! We cant wait to go back for opera night...and of course we are waiting for his next wine dinner.  Best in the valley."
3,"This would actually be another 2.5 Star experience but I went ahead and rounded it up to 3 stars since I am in a good mood.  We came here after going to Chelseas Kitchen down the street which was super packed for the night.  I easily get annoyed with complementary valet parking because I hardly ever carry cash and feel weird if I do not tip the valet boys and girls but I digress.... The concept and look of this place is really fun and different.  I felt like I was in a modern barn.  We walked in and put our name on the list and was surprised that it is all done by an i-Pad and you receive a text message when your table is ready.  Good thing the bf and I remembered our phones or else we would have been out of luck.  The wait wasnt horrible.  We went to the bar and got a couple of glasses of wine, the bartenders didnt seem really in a hurry to help us which got me a little annoyed. We were seated in a cozy, and I mean cozy 2 top table right in a main traffic way.  My bf and I are not big people and felt uncomfortable in the size of the table.  I know you want to pack a lot of tables in a small space but at the expense of the customer?  Our waiter was friendly enough but not as friendly as he was to the group of women that was seated next to us.... nothing like treating all your tables equal huh? We ordered an appetizer, the zucca chips, which had a decent flavor but were a little burnt.  We ordered out main dishes which were a chicken dish and their version of spaghetti and meatballs.  The wait for the food wasnt bad either but I hate when you as the customer have to ask for a wine list because your wine was empty for 10 minutes but the waiter didnt ask if you wanted anything else because he was focused on the table of 5 women next to us sharing an appetizer.   I had the pasta and meatballs, which was meh.  The pasta was a little mushy and the meatballs really didnt have much flavor.  My bf had the chicken dish with spinach which he loved!  All in all the experience wasnt bad but wasnt good.  Maybe they are still working out their kinks but this place probably wont be high on my list to return any time soon!"
5,"This is Mesas best breakfast, hands down! This is one of my familys favorite Saturday/Sunday brunch places in the valley.  Crackers & Co. is great food at great prices and we always take out-of-town guests there when visiting! I was never a fan of eggs unless they were scrambled or in an omelette, but Crackers showed me the way to delicious fried and poached eggs!  The Eggs Benny is great, both Traditional and California-style. Their omelettes are huge and never overcooked (my fave: Spinach Mushroom) . The skillets are mighty tasty and really satisfying (my fave: The Vatican with eggs over easy). Try their French toast... its got great flavor and is delightfully crispy.  If you get a chance, try lunch there! Their soups are so scrumptious and the sandwiches are to die for! The Cream of Spinach and Artichoke soup tastes just like a bowl of spinach and artichoke dip, and they dont skimp on the artichokes at all! The Chicken Dumpling soup is seriously the best Ive ever had (Im not even a fan of dumplings!)! The Roma Tomato Chicken Melt is my favorite sandwich on the menu (such good flavor!), followed closely by the Drunken Chicken sandwich. Their burgers are quite good and along with their salads, they serve up a hefty portion! Beware though of 30 to 45 minute wait times on the weekends in the winter due to snowbirds flocking for breakfast. The wait times let up about 12:30P though, so its great for those who cant decide between breakfast or lunch!"
5,"Ive been planning a visit to the Public Market for some time now, and was downtown today so I finally stopped in for lunch.  I had the ""Friggin Chicken"", which was friggin delicious.  The market fare is counter service, but when I was ordering the cashier was very friendly and courteous and brought my food to me out on the patio. This was a very pleasant first experience, sitting on the patio reading a book, sipping my canned mint green tea, and eating my sandwich with a side of couscous.  The atmosphere was very relaxed and there were others nearby sharing a bottle of wine, or just finishing up their lunch with good conversation.  Speaking of the wine, there was an impressive wine and craft beer selection.  Ill be going back to sample the beverages very soon. On my way out, I stopped at the coffee bar for a latte, which was much more bold and flavorful than your ""Fast Food Coffee"" variety; a great way to finish off my lunch.  If youre looking for a quick, inexpensive, fresh and local dining experience, check this place out."
4,"I like this Sams. I get my eye exams/contacts/glasses here and some groceries. Its almost always pretty dead and therefore easy to get in and out quickly and easily. They dont have nearly the selection that most Costco do, but Ive never waited in line here."
3,"Finding this quaint location wasnt to hard... i like that there is a parking lot right north of the place... as well as street parking :)  you walk in the place and wow... its a completely different atmosphere... low lighting but in a calming way rather than creepy...  they have a DJ.. the music makes the setting but to be honest it was a little odd for my taste,,,  Our waitress was very nice and helpful... automatically served us cucumber water... (which tastes amazing!!) and then asked for our drink orders ... a good waitress can seriously turn everything upside down or completely make your visit ya know... its a pet peeve of mine.. customer service...  every table had a pink candle lit... pink lights hung above the chefs area... it was just so relaxing! the mirrors on the wall around this cool looking splatter painting... i was diggin it...  everything on their menu is served as appetizers... which kinda sucks.. they are all at least 6-12 bucks at least ... from what i saw.. and the waitress said that they recommend for people to get at least 2-3 a piece.... wow, on top of drinks.. its kinda pricey to me.. good thing we shared everything...  the lemongrass chicken (cant remember the full title) was amazing!! so good... the gyozo (dumplings) were alright.. a little too minty for my taste... we had this other thing where they bring you the hot stone and you cook your own meat... it was alright but the stone only stayed hot enough to cook the meat med rare... i dont like my meat to moo at me... so its was alright... but i prefer it well done...  the beef wrapped in grape leaves.. well i was soo excited to try them.. but was sadly disappointed... they were so fiery hot (spicy) that i almost had tears in my eyes... never did it say on the menu .. SPICY... after a server came over and saw us gasping for water.. he filled us up and said, oh yea those are pretty spicy... wow good thing i had my TUMS lol  over all  The atmosphere was amazing.....  the staff was fabulous...  the food... eh...  the menu is crap... if your gonna serve spicy food you should say its spicy! isnt that some sort of health hazard?!  and its kinda on the pricey side...  i think i would go back again... But i dont think i would opt to...  there are alot more dishes i would like to try... maybe a different location would be better?"
5,"Tacos, tacos, tacos......how can something so simple be this great? Having seen this place being featured on DDD we had to try it out and it was worth every penny! I have a thing for always trying the ""odd"" menu items so Ive tried the tongue tacos and cabeza (head/cheek) burrito and to me there is nothing better on the menu! This place is rather small which makes it perfect if youre there with some friends or a special someone! My friend loves the shrimp ceviche though I havent tried it myself. Go to this place for some great authentic, local and quite tasty food.......probably some of the best the east alley has to offer!"
5,"I have been going to the Matador since I was little when it was a little hole in the wall on 2nd Street.  They have always had great Sonoran style Mexican food!  Its always our go to place when we attend events downtown or have business to attend to. They also have the best hot sauce in town!  As far as the service,  the food comes out quickly and we never really have to wait long.  If youre downtown and looking for great food I would highly recommend this place."
3,"I came, I Kiltlifted til the wee hours, caught up with a friend who was in town for a few days and staying nearby. Decent enough bar, was able to talk above the music without yelling, no asshatness witnessed and they have Kiltlifter. Service was attentive, a team effort, yet a bit robotic. They seemed a bit overstaffed, and well , just bored. Did I mention the Kiltlifter?"
2,"I just moved to the area so use Yelp but was very sad that the experience here was not worth making a return visit.  The only reason I am posting is because it has not been reviewed in so long.   I did not like how the spa pedicure was one price and then things you would expect in a spa pedicure was ""upgrades"".  I want to ask for a pedicure and then lay back enjoy the chair and some reading.   After the pedicure, the woman left me in the chair for my nails to dry and think she completely forgot about me!  I would have left if she had put my flip flops on before painting my nails.  Their child was cute, but I do not go to get a pedicure to play games with other peoples children.   Then to top it off, when I paid she asked for my pin as she was walking away (again)....no pin, it was a credit card....usually this would not bother me but I was already frustrated at this point."
5,I love this place. It was so beautiful over the holidays with all the lights and garlands. I think the people who run this have a lot of pride in their business. The room was clean and the beds so comfortable. The decor is rustic but elegant at the same time. I liked how close we got to park to our room...super convenient. Lots of coupons given to us at checkin too. Great experience!
5,I highly reccomend this place. They helped my girlfriend and I figure out our taxes and deductions so that we could get the max refund. We both had been doing our taxes online and missing out on hundreds in deductions. Ill never use another online service to do my taxes again as long as these guys are here.
4,"Been going to Baileys for the last six months. Its an older crowd during the day, but at night and on the weekends the crowd id much younger! Bartenders are all friendly and the drinks are cheap, though they could be stronger. I highly recommend it!"
5,"The best fish tacos, period!  And I hate chain restaurants!"
4,"My sister in law and her fiance took us to Jimmy Johns after discovering it. The location is really convenient to us, which is great. I enjoyed my sandwich. The branding is a little intense. EVERYTHING, right down to the chips, is branded with the Jimmy Johns logo. Its all good but its a little crazy. The sandwiches are big and the cookies they sell by the register are huge! Prices dont seem too bad either. A nice sandwich stop."
4,"Family business bagel shops are my favorite.  I found this place through Groupon and decided to check it out.  The name itself intrigued me as Lox means salmon fillet that is cured.  I didnt go with salmon, but I got a honey wheat bagel with veggie lite cream cheese.  The cream cheese was freshly made with carrots, garlic, and celery.  It had a light taste to go with a healthy and hearty sized bagel.  My friends got croissants with cheese which tasted delicious as well.  The prices are very reasonable here and you can order bagels by the dozen."
5,Love this place! I think this is probably the best Chinese buffet out here! They serve quality gourmet food. And they have a full bar too. Place is clean and service is great. Would go back anytime!
3,"I like this mall.  Its in a decent location, there are lots of good stores, and the clientele here is bearable.  Ive always thought of this mall as just below Scottsdale, but without all the silicone and snobbery.  We went last weekend to kill some time and were a little surprised to see that it was overrun with screaming toddlers.  I guess I should have known that when the AZ temperatures tip past 100 degrees, we have nothing better to do then hang out inside air conditioned malls or hang out inside air conditioned movie theatres, take your pick.  Anyway, the store selection is pretty good here, I just wish they would add a Crate and Barrel and a LUSH, then I would never have to visit Scottsdale again."
1,"We were so disappointed!  We were on vacation in Scottsdale and wanted to try a Brazilian restaurant.  It was nothing like the one we have had home.  Actually it was completely worse than all three Brazilian steakhouses we have close to home.  I tried about 12 different meats and I think there were only 2 out of the 12 that were tender.  The rest were over cooked or hard as a rock.  We really wanted to love this place as I kept trying more and more of the meats as they came around hoping the next one would be better.  Besides being hard, the meats didnt have much flavor.  The salad bar was okay and I dont know that I would even pay the cheaper price to just eat from their salad bar.  This is sad that I have to say the highlight or our meal was the fresh bread and salami slice you get at the salad bar.  :("
1,"I was severely mislead by Frank As, ""Its hot, but the food aint bad."" review.  It was very cold and by far the worst food Ive ever eaten.  You would have to drag me here in cuffs to get me to return."
5,"One of my favorite brunch spots.  Not the cheapest, but you come here to admire the Arcadia families/couples coming into have brunch.  There is sometimes a wait but it is worth it.  I have a hard time deciding between the lunch salads and breakfast.  I usually cave and get the french toast or ginormous belgian waffle.  Parking is plentiful but it is on a weird corner in the strip mall, if you are going, look for cork and cleaver."
2,"This is the first time Ive had a bad experience at an Oreck store. My 6 year old sweeper suddenly began spewing dirt out. The bag wasnt close to full yet and it didnt appear anything was stuck. The sales associate without opening it up began to insist I needed a new roller brush for $40. When I showed him it looked fine to me and wouldnt that be covered by warranty, he got upset with me and began stomping around. I also showed him a warranty sticker from 2010 on the machine which stated that there was a new roller brush installed and also asked him to look up my Oreck warranty. He found my name in their system and then began shoving my sweeper at me insisting I just take it and leave then, since I obviously didnt trust him. This man was totally weird and his behavior and attitude felt very unprofessional.  I still like Oreck but do not recommend this store."
5,"I hate ordering flowers sight unseen, but needed a local florist for a sympathy arrangement. Rachel immediately alleviated any concern when we discussed what I wanted in detail, and she even emailed me a photo of the final arrangement.  Gorgeous flowers, same day delivery and reasonable pricing - cant beat that."
3,"Visited recently for the first time.  Enjoyed happy hour appetizers on the patio.  Cool place for outdoor dining, the waterfall added a nice background.  They offer smoking and non-smoking on separate sides of the patio.  Of course you know that if anyone is smoking, the entire area gets to ""enjoy"" the smoke.  Being a non-smoker, I would appreciate an true non-smoking area but being outdoors was too compelling to pass on this beautiful day.  Another small observation - the tables were too low for the chairs causing you to lean over to eat and the chairs were not comfortable at all.   We ordered chicken quesadilla & crab cake appetizer.  The quesadilla was made w/ green chiles and cheese, served w/ green & red salsa.  Didnt care for the red salsa but the green was pretty good, rather mild.  A side of sour cream was all that was missing here.  Crab cakes were ok, nothing special.  Served w/ a nice side salad it made a very good small meal.  A side of some kind of orange sauce (chipotle?) for the crab cakes that seemed really HOT to me - skip this next time please. Just based on the outdoor atmosphere alone, I would definitely come back again."
5,Its not a standard restaurant as it is in the middle of a grocery store...but thats just what it is get over it!  The food however is fantastic!  I ordered the samosa chaat...A samosa covered in chick peas and other sauces and chatney.  A delicious Punjabi snack!  The portion was very generous and the price cheap.  I also recently ordered a dozen samosas to bring home and serve at a dinner party.  Very convenient and good service.  I will be a regular from now on!
5,Excellent. Fresh and yummy!
5,Great decor. Great food and very good service. You have to try the pork belly pastrami. To die for! Their version of the Manhattan was very good. As for the main courses you cant go wrong with the scallops or the smoked duck. For dessert go with the black & tan pudding. Oh soooo good. Highly recommend this place.
4,"This staff at this United Blood service is first rate. Always quick and effiiant. They are always staffed and ready to go when I arrive for my appointment. Ive donated blood at this location 10+ times and have never had to wait. Of course, I cant encourage everyone enough to donate and donate often."
4,"If you are a beer snob, stay at home trying to make it yourself.  If you enjoy a decent local beer in an old chandler building with a nice atmosphere give this place a shot.  The owner used to be a brew-master at Four Peaks Brewery which is a local favorite in Tempe.   I am not a fan of the over-the-top Hops that a lot of folks enjoy.  A few of the offerings here have a bit too much bite for me.  The red ale was my favorite until they changed the recipe and over did the bitterness.  Right now I get a Sun Devil Ale when I go in and it is pretty good.  They will bring you a taster if you ask and will explain the offerings to help you choose.     The food is always good.  It is a bar so dont expect 5 star cuisine.  The fries are great and the sandwiches and salads are good as well.  I havent been disappointed with a meal yet.  Even when busy service is decent.  Enjoy the beer, watch the game and let it all unfold."
5,"This mall has all the upscale shopping that you will ever need. Just make sure you come here with your credit cards in check as you are bound to fall in love with something when you come here. They have some of the best department stores in my opinion, and if youre looking for that perfect dress for any occasion, you have tons of options to choose from. I love how clean and perfect this mall is!"
4,"Had lunch here with 6 coworkers and the server accomodated 5 seperate checks with no fuss. She quickly brought out two baskets of soft warm bread that looked handmade, along with pouring out balsamic vinegar and light olive oil for dipping. The server described the days special, but we all ended up ordering eight inch pizzas (a lunch only size.) I had bacon and chose to have it cooked in the optional brick oven for $1 extra (not sure why they offer it seperately, but exp. at other places made me like the way it cooks better than reg. oven.) It wasnt much to go on, but the food was good, the service friendly and efficient, and the everything was clean and neat. Recommended if youre in the area."
4,"Cibo is positively adorable.  I love the atmosphere.  I love the little house, and the yard.  I love the excessively busy yet amazingly friendly servers.  I love the iced tea.  I love the bread.  I love the Antipasto plate.  I love making ad-hoc bruchetta out of said bread and Antipasto.  I love the margherita pizza. Just on a Thursday afternoon alone, I dont think Id ever come with a large group of people.  It just doesnt seem like a wise life decision. Really? Its love overall.  Love, love, love, love.  When I can, Im dragging my family here."
2,"just wanted to chime in & say that this place is so vegetarian-UN-friendly its not even funny. I was dragged here with family & ended up ordering a chile relleno, which was just about the only meatless item on the menu, short of a fucking cheese crisp. it wasnt terrible, but this place is really just all kinds of lame. service was mediocre, food was mediocre. with as many awesome & authentic mexican restaurants as there are in the valley, theres no reason on earth to come back, except MAYBE to try a mango margarita."
4,"It is a nice place. Actually when i have just come in, everything seems to look normal. Nothing different frm other nail salons. However, when a lady did manicure and pedicure for me, she did really good service. She always smile a lot, and made you feel comfortable. I will come back soon and tell my friends abt this salon cause they did a good job."
4,"Had the pleasure of enjoying House of Tricks last night, for the second time in the past twelve months. With a party of six, I was excited to get to see a range of dishes and try out most of the menu via my dining companions choices.  The restaurant, found in Tempe near ASU, is not hard to find and houses both indoor and outdoor seating.  The outdoor seating is where we ended up last night and between the fire pit in the middle of the grounds and the abundance of trees/greenery, the setting works quite well.   Our party was seated immediately and without problem, the night was off to a solid start.  Our waitress, Jamie, was both friendly and courteous.  Jamie had a great understanding of the menu, the specials and especially the wine.  Her recommendations for multiple members of the party worked out perfectly.  Each person in our party ordered an appetizer and off we went. I had the pork belly, on Jamies suggestion. Other choices within our party included the salmon cake, sweetbreads two ways, and the scallops.  I thought the pork belly was great. It had a pea puree as a base sauce and some baby carrots that just killed.  The scallops were tasty and cooked perfectly.  The sweetbreads two ways were a bit of a letdown.  As a lover of sweetbreads, I have had the pleasure of tasting some of the best variations of there preparation. These were just not that great.  They werent cooked properly and the seasoning was lacking.  This would be the only lacking dish of the evening. For the entree, I had the pork osso bucco.  This was a real treat, cooked evenly, tender and tasty.  Other entree selections around the table included the ahi tuna, the salmon, and the duck.  The tuna was the standard seared variety on a bed of mashed potatoes.  Both diners who chose this selection were quite satisfied.  My companion had the duck and while she certainly enjoyed the dish, she found the duck slightly fatty.  All around, the entrees were solid and plates were cleaned.   With little room left for dessert, we ordered three selections for the table to share.  All were good and once again our plates were cleaned off.  The dessert best was agreed upon to be the homemade smore the restaurant produces.   All in all, this is a solid restaurant with a good atmosphere and good service.  I would eat here again and recommend you to do the same."
4,I was super excited to find a place in Arizona that has vegetarian pho! The service was just mediocre.  It met basic requirements without any friendliness. Very cost effective= CHEAP.
4,"Came here in a daze after not having slept for a loooong time and flying in to the airport with Dad; reminds me of the nice breakfast diners in Chicago, got the combo with turkey sausage (still greasy--defeats the purpose), eggs (always the same everywhere), french toast (more white bread, nothing too special but filling), coffee.  Nice atmosphere and no major problems, would be great for the weekend brunch!"
4,"While I am giving this restaurant four stars, I must start off by noting that the pizza here is mediocre.  If you want spectacular pizza in Phoenix, dont kid yourself that its at I-17 and Thomas.  Its over at Pizzeria Bianco. However, the other items on the dinner menu are worthy of a visit to the hood.   The Penne alla Vodka ($12.95) offers up pasta in tomato sauce with bacon, fresh basil cream and vodka.  It is an excellent starter to split with a dining companion and thats exactly what the BF and I do every time we visit this place.  The Cozze Posolipo mussels in garlic white wine sauce ($11.95) are also quite tasty as an appetizer.  The complimentary warm pizza dough they serve with an onion and olive topping is a nice touch.  For entrees, the Pollo Parmigiana ($14.95) is the classic breaded chicken breast with marinara, mozzarella and parmesan cheese served with penne.  The Lasagna della Casa with Bolognese sauce ($13.95) is very good, but the portion is a bit stingy for the price.  The BF often enjoys the Gamberi alla Pana ($15.95) that includes jumbo shrimp sautéed with mushrooms in a brandy cream sauce over a bed of fettuccine.  Please note that the brandy cream sauce is extremely rich.  Another tasty option is the Spaghetti con Salsiccia ($13.95) with mushrooms, bell peppers, onions and Italian sausage in marinara sauce with a touch of white wine.  The Cheese Ravioli ($13.95) is another great choice with the tomato cream sauce.  For dessert, be sure to order a Cannoli Siciliani ($5.95) as its the very best I have had in Phoenix.  The Tiramisu ($5.95) is good as well. The bad news is that this place is no longer BYOB.  For whatever reason, the management decided that a restaurant that seats no more than 20 needed a full liquor license.  I really hope that the investment in that spendy license doesnt lead to the undoing of this place.  Given that they dont even have a bar area and I almost never see anyone order a mixed drink, I think staying BYOB might have been a better choice for this neighborhood joint. The service at this place is also part of the show.  The waiter may well be manic as he will either be way up or way down for your visit.  The décor here is pleasant enough given the location of this tiny restaurant in a modest strip mall.  If you happen to need a trip to the restroom, you will get the chance to traipse through the kitchen. All in all, Pizza A Metro is ironically a great option for everything but pizza."
3,"Typical dumpy yet fairly clean little sports bar in a strip mall setting. Get your tires changed next door at Discount Tire and grab a few heinekins while you wait. Beware though, they call it coppers because it is owned and frequented by Cops and for some reason there are a lot of people missing limbs that frequent the place.?. hum. ho."
5,"Being my first review, there is only one place Ive always had a 5-star experience. Hoodlums is the ultimate music/cd/vinyl/DVD/used music store in the Valley. ZIA and Stinkweeds are a distant second in terms of selection, price and overall experience. Steve and Kristian are two of the nicest local business owners Ive ever met. They know a ton about music and the local scene. Theyll help you find anything you need. Tucked in the SW corner of Guadalupe and McClintock (next to Traders Joes), this is a special place to find that CD/DVD youve been waiting to purchase.  They also have a wide selection of used CDs and DVDs to are at bargin prices, be sure to check that out too!"
1,"Im sorry. Youre too busy to look up my club card information? Too busy too push the button to do the search, enter my phone number and click ok? I took the time once upon whenever to sign up for your card. And now, you cant take 5 seconds to look it up for me? Let me clue you in, the cashiers here have always looked it up. It always takes 5-10 seconds at most! Great customer service. Insert sarcasm here for the uneducated. Other Big Lots this hasnt been a problem. Just the one."
2,"It was an OK gyro for almost twice as much as the other places Ive been to. It had a ridiculous amount of mutton sausage (thats what ""gyro meat"" is, fwiw,) and was pretty tasty, but not as good as a $4 gyro at Ali Baba. The price you pay for location, I guess. This would have gotten three stars, but then it gave me indigestion all day and I couldnt eat dinner, so it loses some for that."
5,I recently stayed at the Sheraton for two nights while attending a conference in Phoenix. I was blown away by the services. This is by far the best service I have received while staying at a hotel in recent years. I received a room on the 15 floor. Room was what you expect from Sheraton. The view from the room really sucked!! I got the room with a view of the hotel satellite and communications towers. TV quality was good and room had Starbucks coffee. Room also came with a refrigerator. I would like to see Sheraton move to Nespresso machines. After a long day attending a conference was great to relax at the hotel lobby bar. The desserts are yummy. I didnt get a chance to try the restaurants in the hotel. Hooters and Starbucks are directly across the street. My work colleague used the gym. He said the pool was really nice and gym had everything you need. Next time!!! I would definitely stay here again!!
5,"Does anyone know why their regular subs are $1 more than all the other Jimmy Johns? Or is that just when its delivered, instead of charging a standard delivery fee? Ive noticed that with the other types of sandwiches too, and extras...the slim is $4 instead of $3.25, and extra avo is $1.75 instead of $0.75 Thats not going to stop me from ordering though :-) Still love their sandwiches...they make the best veggie sub Ive had. They load it up with veggies, whereas I have to ask for extra everything at a certain other sub chain and then they still barely put any on. Id much rather pay a little bit extra for Jimmy Johns :-)"
4,"As my roomies put it: ""Finally a Thai place in Mesa that I actually like."" ""This tastes like my Moms Thai restaurant in Utah."" Three of my roomies and I ordered the Panang Curry with Beef, Red Curry with Chicken, Tom Yum Koong, Spicy Chicken and 4 Thai Iced Teas. The curry was the right consistency, not watered down and too thick. And the best part was that it was just deeelish! What is great about this place is that the spices dont overpower the dish, and you can taste many different flavors with each bite. This little place seats under 16 people max. Its a definite mom and pops store that makes tasty and very reasonable priced meals. We chatted how we wish we hit this place up sooner because its one of the best tasting ones in the Phoenix area."
4,"This place defies being stuck in a single category. Their menu is a bit eclectic and my only regret is not getting to try more of it. This place was right around the corner from my hotel on a recent business trip. We liked it so much, we ate here a couple of times. Im sorry Alex P. felt that he was getting attitude. One of my coworkers asked if he could have the daily special from the previous day because he had liked it so much. They told him it wouldnt be a problem and fixed it right up for him. The food was good and reasonably priced. I was there in April and enjoyed getting to sit outside on their patio and enjoy the awesome weather."
5,"Even though the new place is limited on seating the food more than makes up the difference.   I took my wife and kids for lunch.  We had some pulled pork and beef brisket sandwiches, fresh made slaw, and mac and cheese made from scratch like mom used to make.  The kids gobbled up the mac and cheese.  The meat was definately cooked with love.   Gradys makes their own signature sauce in several varieties.  They sell bottles of it as well.  I liked mixing the Hot with the Super Hot to make that pork melt that much better in my mouth. I also noticed they do catering.  Ive had events catered by some other BBQ joints before, but this food is much better quality and I think I can woo the crowds with Gradys BBQ. I fully recommend stopping into my new favorite barbeque place in Arizona. Thanks for making good food Grady.  We all enjoyed it and writing this made me hungry for more."
3,"I hate being disappointed by bars bragging about their ""huge"" number of taps... while I cant dispute that they have 52 beers on tap, I can tell you that very few of them are worth drinking.. and that the prices here are on the ok to high side... I would never come back if its not happy hour or late night pricing. I asked general questions about not discounted pricing, nine dollars for a Manhattan made with Jack Daniels and beers ranging from five to seven dollars... if Im paying seven bucks for a pint at a sports bar in Tempe it had better be something from Russian River or a Stone anniversary brew... and a nine dollar Manhattan seems out of place... this isnt Scottsdale or a hotel bar.    Well the good news, Thirsty Lion is quite lovely inside, plenty of seating and dim lights, really not a bad place to relax and mellow out. Plus, the food was great, everything weve had has been very tasty, now its all been off of the happy hour menu, but thats the only time Ill probably be here, the scotch eggs are delicious and my main recommendation. Im hoping that in time prices will drop a bit and more craft breweries will get represented, but aside from the nice interior and spot on happy hour menu, Thirsty Lion just doesnt stand out enough to steal me away from Boulders or Taste of Tops..."
4,"I am excited about this place, even though I have not had many opps to try northern style Chinese food.  Think dough, and dont mistakenly believe its the same dough steam/cooked/fried/stuffed in different ways.   The kind owner lady proudly told me each of our 3 dishes was made w/ a unique dough recipe...  At first I was worried all the dough would overpower my tastebuds, until I asked for some dipping sauce... they kindly made me a black vinegar, ginger, and scallion sauce... that just upleveled everything.  Who knows if its traditional or not, but I implored the owner to start dishing this out when Americans like me (smiley face) come over and eat. The off-menu items are written on a small whiteboard sitting atop the freezer stuffed w/ to-go dumplings... luckily the folks there speak English, so Ill be working my way thru this secret menu and who knows.. this might go 5 stars! SW corner of Ray and Alma School, next to the JCC."
3,"I am a BIG fan of chicken and waffles and I will try it just about anywhere it is served.  I especially love it in the morning; when everyone else is ordering a light breakfast, expect me to go for the fried chicken. Lo-Los was just alright for me.   I liked the chicken, but I was not fond of the waffles.  They were a little too... thin?  Light?  I dunno how to describe it, but I like my chicken AND my waffles to have a little crunch.  And there was kind of an interesting taste to the waffles.  I cant put my finger on the flavor. I liked the atmosphere okay, but I probably wont be back. I know Mrs. Whites Golden Rule Cafe is not for everyone, but honestly I prefer the feel there.  It feels less ""affected"" by its customers, I guess.  For some reason I am finding it hard to come up with the words here, but Lo Los feels like it is the more popular cousin of Mrs. Whites... you know... the one with the Letter in Football. Anyway, I am glad Lo-Los is thriving...  Maybe I will try the Scottsdale location sometime to see if they have a different spin on things."
3,"While throwing a small get together, we were able to have a back patio with a buffet style table set up with some pretty tasty appetizers.  The chicken sqewers were delicious and smoked salmon was also tasty but something seemed to lack.  At the end of the day it was good and I wouldnt hesitate to go back, but nothing to make me a raving fan."
4,"Service, awesome.  Food, spectacular.  Price, unbeatable.  I cant tell you how many times this restaurant has saved my life.  Richard is very understanding when I come in completely hung over, and knows to put extra kimchi in my side dishes.   Also, in terms of the local ""$20 all you can eat"" sushi specials, this is the only place that ever pops into my head as  a place I need to go.  Their sushi chef if spectacular and super friendly so its always a nice time sitting at the bar. They have a special lunch menu that is served only during the week, so you can expect the dinner menu on Saturday and Sunday regardless of the time you go.  Both menus are amazing, its just that the menus are slightly different in their options so if you have a specific craving (and I often do) you might have to concede to something different once you get there.  Its mildly annoying, but the food never disappoints so I let it go. Try it, you wont be disappointed."
5,"The food is fantastic, the staff is helpful and the atmosphere is comfortable.  The food at El Bravo just tastes better than the food at any other Mexican restaurant I have been to in Phoenix, regardless of price. The cheese is amazing!  I love their flour tortilla flautas , crispy beef tacos, cheese crisps, enchiladas (I could go on and on).  I really can see no reason to go anywhere else in Phoenix for Mexican food.  I highly recommend El Bravo."
3,"For some reason or another this macys has a better selection of shoes than the one at Scottsdale mall. In the past year I found a pair of Calvin Klein sandals for half off, and they carry the higher end, younger brands- which is great Nordstroms selection tends to be for an older crowd."
4,"A bit pricey, yet one of the best breakfast sandwiches you will find.  Parking is slim."
4,"Let me first start off by saying I was skeptical.  I had no idea what to expect and after reading a ton of reviews, we thought we would give it a shot.  Located in an old converted home in Heritage Park right across from Pizzeria Bianco the place is small and intimate and just an experience in and of itself. Now for the food.  Where do I begin?  Tapas (small plates) style, and community (share) the experience is in ordering from each section of the menu. We started with the Kimci and Nasu.  The Kimci is a Napa cabbage cold plate that will rock your world; a little sweet, a little spicy it was a great way to start.   The Nasu is an eggplant with a bacon marinade of sorts on top and while I am describing it poorly it was truly delishous.  Amazing!! Next was the Yellowtail Ceviche.  This WAS OUT OF THIS FING WORLD.  Inexplicable but so, SO GOOD.   Next was 2 off the menu plates, chicken and Wagyu beef short ribs.  The ONLY REASON this place does not get 5 stars is 2 of the 3 different types of chicken were mediocre.  The wasabi grilled chicken was pure wasabi on grilled chicken.   The 2nd was a panko fried chicken, which was moist and delishous but nothing amazing, HOWEVER the 3rd chicken was an orange peel fried chicken that way just so good beyond words. Lastly, the Wagyu beef short ribs were so so so amazing, I mean, I never wanted the taste to leave my mouth. The service, very good Juan (our server) was very attentive and very helpful as it was our first time there...but it most definitely will not be our last...oh and THEY VALIDATE FOR PARKING ;)"
2,"With regard to AMber W.s points 1. Im rating the food not the containers or the owners 2. If it makes you feel better eating subpar food because of the American Spirit so be it. Others of us are more concerned with the food itself. 3. Im not downgrading it because its not a sit down restaurant. Even among non-sit down restaurants or ""fast food"" style Indian themed eateries, this place is subpar. Ive eaten at quick Indian eateries and they are much better than this. 4. My review is for people who understand and can appreciate good Indian food. Its not for people who value text service, nice containers and chatty owners. 5. I want to support mom and pop and locally owned restaurants but I also want to support good ones and not encourage bad ones to emerge simply because there is no competition for Indian themed restaurants here."
5,"Just open.  I had the roast beef sandwich and my wife had the turkey and stuffing sandwich.  Both were excellent, modern interpretations on classic lunches.  I highly reccommend this place. P.S.:  iPad driven POS system is way cool."
4,"Hey Guys,  This place is awesome....but I could be jaded because of all the wonderful wines I sampled! From the gris, cabs, sparkling shiraz, riesling to the chardonnay, this shop had what we were looking for and what we werent looking for! The atmosphere was amazing and quiet for a Thursday night get together. Our hostess was sweet and doted to our every need. The food was amazing. I completely recommend the crocodile pot stickers.  For exotic wines and exotic meats appetizers, look up Down Under Wines!"
4,"Every once in a while, you just need to enjoy good southern cooking. I was taken to Lo-los while visiting Phoenix. The Sweet Tea is served in a mason jar and comes with a diabetic attack. I had the Betty Bop - fried chicken breast and waffle. The waffle was really the stand out portion of the meal, but the two did work together. You dont have to get the chicken and waffle combo. But come on, dont be like that. We went Friday before lunch, and we were sitting and eating in 10 minutes, but from the looks of the other reviews, that isnt normal."
5,How could you write a bad review about a mountain?  Great sight to see.
4,"Clean facility, prices are super low! You cant go wong with saving money!"
5,"General Manager Scott Petello is a good egg!!! Not to go into detail, but let me assure you if you have any issues (albeit rare) speak with Scott and treat the guy with some respect as you state your case and Id be surprised if you dont walk out totally satisfied as I just did. Like I always say..... ""Mistakes are inevitable, its how we recover from them that is important""!!! Thanks to Scott and his awesome staff. Youve got a customer for life!! .......... :^)"
4,"Food is whatevers, drinks the same. However, this DnB compared to the one in Tempe is much better if youre really just interested in getting some game time in. The on at Tempe Marketplace is crazy busy, like 11 people waiting in line to play basketball crazy. When I go to an arcade and am already dropping 20+ bucks to play games I want that gaming experience to be nonstop. However, the drive is really far for someone that lives in Gilbert... so thats really the only reason why it gets a 4 star."
4,"Never had a bad meal. Just this week had the halibut ceviche special and as always the best guacamole (especially if you like garlic). The green chile stew was good, although I would have liked a bit more kick. Dined in the patio for the first time and it was great atmosphere. However it was a bit humid. Still a great experience."
1,"So a friend of mine went here last Friday, and they were double charged.  The bartender took advantage of the situation and threw out the receipt to avoid cancelling the $60 amount. Which she claims and assumes was her tip (on a $60 bill). ""I get a 100% tips!"" umm..yeah.. I think I will skip this place for sure!"
5,"This is one excellent Ethiopian restaurant, rivals anything Ive sampled in Washington DC or Seattle.  If I lived in Phoenix, this would be a Top-5 restaurant for me (along with Lo-Los Chicken & Waffles - yum!). Lalibela takes a slightly different approach to their menu.  Many of the entrees are offered as small portions ($4.50-$6.00 each).  They suggest each diner order 2-3 of these to make a meal. Kitfo and Lamb Tibs dishes are offered as full entrees and like many Ethiopian restaurants, you can order combo plates (meat combo, veggie combo, house combo plate etc.).  This made deciding on our meal a little more complicated, but also offered more flexibility for sampling different dishes. Our favorite dish ordered was the Lamb Tibs (the spicy version with Awaze spice paste).  Lamb was soooo tender, and the spices were a delight - rich in flavor but not too hot for those with tame palettes.  Good thing it comes as a full order - four of us were competing for bites!!  We ordered a half portion of Keye Wott (beef in a spicy brown sauce) that was some of the best Ive ever had.  Again, rich in flavor but not too spicy.  My favorite Ethiopian meat dish is Kitfo - choice beef sort of like steak tartar (servered raw or lightly cooked) but with Ethiopian spices.  Lalibelas was pretty good, just not transcendent like the Lamb Tibs or Beef Keye Wott.  The vegetable dishes were on a whole excellent - especially the yellow lentils, gomen (collard greens) and spicy (Wott) lentils. Staff was great - attentive, helpful service.  Unlike some Ethiopian restaurants, this one is very user-friendly.  Although in some cases  the menu accommodates American tastes it doesnt compromise on quality or authenticity.  One note on the injera (sponge-like bread used to scoop up the entrees) - its a mix of wheat flour and teff (a grain indigenous to Ethiopia) and I dont think its fermented like injera that is made with 100% teff.  Im used to the latter, but you can argue Lalibelas injera doesnt compete with the flavor of the entrees as much. All in all, one of the best Ethiopian restaurants Ive been to, and I have been to many in the States.  Only problem now is whether my favorite Ethiopian restaurants in Seattle will still taste as good!  Highly, highly recommended."
5,Being from Sweden you just like salmon and at Le Chalet you can get a delicous Nordique Crepe with salmon! Never had anything like that in Sweden! Besides the great crepe and friendly service from the owner Alain Keller I was also treated to a laughing experience. They have a comedy show twice a month. Great place to eat and have a nice relaxed evening!
5,"If youve never had or even heard of bingsoo you NEED to check this place out. I have two friends who were constantly bantering about bingsoo and this Fresco place. I was excited when I found out it was so close to my house. If youve never heard of it, this is how it goes down. Its a layer of shaved ice, then you have your choice of ice cream or FF frozen yogurt, your choice of fresh fruit off the menu (apples, strawberry, mango, banana kiwi and many others) and then your choice of ""sauce"" which is a fruit puree of either strawberry, kiwi or mango and honey. You mix it all together and there you have it. A somewhat healthy dessert! They even have a frequent bingsoo buyers card =)  This place isnt just all about the bingsoo though. They have a menu of fresh sandwiches and fruit juices too!"
1,"Im going to have to agree Whole heartedly. And i informed the manager of it as well. I picked this one because it was close to the Airport and the Light Rail. The noise from the Airport wasnt to bad. But it was the Train Horns all NIGHT LONG and ALL MORNING when your trying to sleep. I wouldnt pick this one, the neighborhood wasnt bad despite what people say. But the Train noise is just unbearable. I got it for the Click 6 rate which was reasonable. Stay Elsewhere. I should of picked one further down that was right off the light rail."
5,"Feeling yucky one day and wanting nothing but some reminders of my bay area asian food... My search began with my iPhone for Pho.. AND I wanted good Pho.. (Im skeptical of some dishes in the desert, just sayin!).. I drove a good 20min from my loft to find this place.. worth it. Usual toppings you will find with real Vietnamese Pho.. but awesome! I asked for a variety of tofu and seafood.. I couldnt finish it all.. but never can with Pho.. its a big bowl, and filling!  Extras on tables to get your Pho on..  Ordered the Vietnamese Shrimp Rolls too.. left feeling not so stuffy! AND full.. OH yeah, and I still had money for a bit of shoe shopping the next day... :-)"
5,"Love me some hidden house!  The music is too loud. The drinks too cheap. The clientele too local. But Ive never had anything but a good time there. Whether its karaoke or weird shit on the weekends youll have fun if you dont expect it to be Merc, cuz Merc it aint. And not for one moment in its life has it pretended to be. But I love it for what it is and thats an experience."
1,"This review is based on delivery, service and food quality as delivered. Second and last time I will be ordering from this place. The first time they forgot a few items and were very off for delivery time.  Tonight I Ordered at 11:03 PM, estimated delivery at 11:50 updated to 11:54 PM (from a whopping 1.5 miles away to add). 11:54 comes and goes. Call them, at 12:07 AM now, I am told they are on their way (1.5 miles away keep in mind). Call back at 12:40 AM to cancel my order as I do not want to eat at 1:00 AM. They actually come to deliver while I am on hold waiting at 12:44 AM. My ""hot sub"" is ice cold, theres nothing like the taste of cold greasy bacon and chicken close to 1:00 AM on a Monday (now Tuesday) night...if you are going to take nearly 2 hours to deliver this, at least make sure the temperature is somewhat close to where it is supposed to be....never again silver mine...never again. This place probably has a ""good taste potential"". Unfortunately, like most ""hot food"" the taste quality substantially decreases the longer it sits...in a fridge, alley, or wherever they decided to leave it for nearly 2 hours. If you feel the need to get food from here..for the love of sub kings please just DONT GET DELIVERY!"
4,"We were staying at a hotel nearby and found the reviews for this spot. Boy are we glad that we did! We are constantly on the hunt for great tacos in any city, this was definitely one for our list.  We ate here for dinner both nights we were in town. The majority of the meals ordered were the 3 taco plates. One carne asada, marinated pork, and carnitas, served with yummy rice and beans- the tortillas were very good too. This is definitely the plate to get here. I think that the carne asada ones were the best.  Normally we order all of our food medium spiced, but beware of the red hot sauce that they put on the tacos. My daughter somehow got an extra dose on her tacos and was having a hard time getting through the burn. This somehow justified the obscene amount of Frescas ordered. :) If you are remotely sensitive to heat, order your sauce on the side."
5,"Huge store, friendly staff"
5,"This is an adorable little gallery located in the middle of nowhere, Downtown Phoenix.  My art teacher friend got fixated on bringing me here when she heard me complaining about Phoenix being chain hell (and thanks to her and Yelp, I dont believe that anymore).  I think she chose wisely as I loved this little space.   It was a nice place to stop and check out, and then of course we had lunch at the attached City Bakery.  A perfect activity for a half-day of school!  Hooray creativity and uniqueness!"
4,"I like Pei Wei, its good when I want something fast. But the main reason for my review on here today was to say HOW AMAZING the manager was at this location.  I came in at lunch and it was VERY busy. There was a line to the door. There were some arguments about someone stealing a seat (unhappy customer, complaining because a seat was saved and they had waited in line, wanted to be comped because of it.... so dumb if you ask me. I mean just deal with it people! Its busy!) But the manager dealt with it so professionally, and when I was next in line he did not act rushed, he was very helpful, and told me that if I did not like what I ordered to just tell him and he would get me something new. I work in the restaurant business (a much higher priced place) and this manager was awesome! Good job man!"
3,"This was supposed to be my trip to have the best pizza in America. So imagine my disappointment that they dont even serve it at lunch. What human who eats pizza thinks it should only be served at dinner?  Whaaat?  I have since been kindly corrected by another yelper that this restaurant isnt the pizzeria. My party was confused, since the server said they DO serve pizza...at dinner. The soprassata focaccia sandwich was fine, but overpriced by about $3.  I dont live here to try it again, so the first impression is the only impression. Ill leave it to all you foodie hipsters to prop up the rating."
5,Love it!!! Wish we still lived in Arizona as Chino is the one thing we miss. Every time I think about Chino Bandido my mouth starts watering. If I am ever in the state again I will drive out of my way just to go to it again. YUMMY!
5,"Lets see...what is there NOT to like about Surprise Stadium? Well, $9.50 tall cans of PBR is about all I could come up with and thats not a surprise (pun intended) considering youre attending a sporting event...even spring training.  But as someone who does not living in Arizona, and as someone who doesnt go to MLB baseball games in Southern California due to the fact it costs so damn much, people bitching about the slow service or any other little inconvenience when it comes to seeing a game here. Look, youre lucky enough to have almost an entire month of low cost MLB baseball right in your back yard. If I could, Id live down here during March just to take in the awesome baseball action that crisscrosses the Phoenix metro area each year.  I attended my first spring training game on March 12th, 2012 at Surprise Stadium as the Royals took on the San Francisco Giants (my favorite team). Our seats (Sec. 112, Row J, Seats 13-14-15) were 25 bucks each (around 30 bucks including service fees). I mean, we were maybe 5 or 6 rows back from the Giants dugout (check out some of my pictures). The stadium (funny calling it that since it only holds just over 10,000 people) is big enough so you feel youre at an MLB game but small enough to feel pretty close and intimate with the players. The stadium is well maintained and kept super clean.  Arriving to the park, I was surprised (pun unintended) to see that parking was free, an oddity when going to an event like this. The stadium staff, as mentioned by other reviews, are mainly made up of senior citizens who were super friendly and helpful. I didnt have to wait long at the concession stands, even if lines were a bit long. The outfield is lined with a lawn area, perfect for people to sit back and have a picnic while taking in a game (Tickets are around 9 bucks each after service fees!!!).  I love this place and hope to return next year when visiting family. Oh, Giants won 2-1! Go Giants!!!"
4,"I like these sort of ""mom & pop"" spots, small and intimate setting.  Great pizza!  I always enjoy the veggie pizza with jalapenos, oh so good!  And mu hubby loves the suicide wings, but weve tried almost everything off of the menu and you CANNOT go wrong.  Prices rock too!"
4,"Yum!  even though it is incredibly heavy and bad for you- YUM.  we got the beef and hominy stew with fry bread and the ultimate taco.  lets start with the stew- though it was just beef and hominy, the broth was so tasty and delicious.  didnt even need the fry bread on the side.  the ultimate taco was pretty awesome- we got the red beef chili and then it had refried beans, cheese, sour cream, and lettuce.  it definitely wasnt gourmet but it was so delicious and so cheap!  gluttonous, but worth it.  we wanted to get a dessert fry bread, but we were just way too full to even go there."
1,"As I promised myself, Id go back again to try it again. Yyyeeaahhhh...sooooo....the food is still not good. I got the mongolian beef and its like ""wha? really? is this IRL?""  Im a chinese food kind of a fan, this restaurant, Im not a fan of."
4,"If your going to see the Phoenix Coyotes at Jobing.com arena.....or the Arizona Cardinals at the University of Phoenix stadium....then you you cant really miss the experience that is the Westgate City Center. Now it is not a spectacular mall by any means...and the parking is a bit confusing...but it does have its own flair and style. During the summer months it is the perfect place to go after a game or event at the stadiums...because you can grab some dinner....a drink...take a nice walk....or just hang out and watch the stars in the beautiful skies over Glendale Arizona.  The best part about all of this along with the close proximity to the stadiums.....is the parking is FREE....cant beat that. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"
5,"I love this Gelato! My favorite combination is the panna cotta with the mint chocolate chip. Weird but wonderful. I am rarely down this way, especially since Ive moved, but I still fantasize about digging in to this deliciousness!   I only ever had great service, and fantastic product here. So far it is the best Gelato Ive had, although I hear Arlecchinos is pretty fantastic as well. I miss visiting Angel Sweet, I will have to go back soon."
5,"Tucked on the western edge of the Foothill Acres neighborhood in North Phoenix or what I would call ""The Slope"", Try Me Bicycle Shop has been in business for nearly 40 years and has been collecting the odd part for every type of bike over that time.  The showroom is filled with cruisers and comfort bikes, new and used. No high end bikes here but they do have an inventory of old and hard-to-find parts, good service and free air that makes this place."
1,I went there with a friend last year after reading so many good reviews. The service is good. We didnt have to wait but I didnt like the food I ordered. I had a salmon with caper butter sauce. The fish is not fresh at all and the food is too geasy for me.
5,"Going to Desert Botanical Garden is the perfect field trip for a beautiful day like today... Ive been to DBG a handful of times for events, exhibit openings, meetings, and of course Yelp In Bloom (a yelper party that I planned a couple of years ago)... but today I went with my son and we met some other friends with the sole purpose of checking out the butterfly exhibit. We didnt get lucky enough to have a butterfly land on us, but we did see tons of gorgeous butterflies.  There were orange butterflies and yellow butterflies and striped butterflies, etc... The flowers in the pavillion are pretty to look at as well.  We visited the gift kiosk afterward and took home a butterfly finger puppet, which I know we will get tons of use from (only $6.25). The exhibit runs until May 13th, so dont miss it! And if you do find yourself with more time while youre there, definitely check out the design for a living world exhibit as well... I saw that when it first opened and it was really cool.  The photography alone is worth a visit. I just wish I had more time to explore DBG more often!"
3,"Weve been in the market looking for a church for the family to start attending. Chandler Christian seemed to be a nice offering since they are located fairly close to the house and have a decent size to offer something for each group (parents & children).  Ive gotten some good reviews from a family that I know that attends.  I LOVE that they have a service on Saturday, as that is ALWAYS a plus for me. The sermon for today was an interesting one, and it seemed to be relevant and on topic for today.  The pastor took an updated slant to the story to make it a bit more relevant to todays time.  My husband was even laughing at the pastors jokes.  My mother-in-law even commented on how she liked the music.  I did notice that the verses that they pulled up were not the verses that I remember.  I believe its due to them using a different version. All of this being said, the service seemed to be a good one. The signage indicated that this was non-denomination; however, the service reminded me one Baptist services from childhood."
4,"Now accepts plastic!  Now accepts plastic!  Did you hear me?  Harveys now accepts plastic! Ive lived around the corner from Harveys for a little over 4 years now.  I had lunch there once in the mid 1990s, and went in to watch a Suns playoff game a few years back when my friend was decked out in Spurs gear and we were nearly lynched at Half Moon.  Quick lunch with a girlfriend who was in the mood for a burger about a year ago.   While I love, and I do mean LOVE a good dive bar, this place scared the crap out of me.  Im young, not hideous, female, and not of the meth-head variety - so not only did I not blend, but I felt targeted.  Sad, really.  The ONE bar within easy drunk stumbling distance from my house, and I wasnt happy going there.  During a weekday for lunch was more or less okay.  But evenings are when the freaks come out.  And I dont mean the freaks like me.  I mean the dangerous crazy ones - not just the fun crazy ones.  Theres a difference! Well, enter the new roommate.  He was disinclined to believe my review, and insisted we go.  I resisted until late Saturday night, when he came home at 1am and insisted I get dressed so we could go there for an hour.  Maybe I was tired.  Maybe I needed a change of pace.  Whatever the reason, I gave in, got dressed and we walked over to Harveys. YAY!  According to Echo, the bartender (yes, its her real name.  her parents are hippies like mine), the owner has been working hard to improve the place (read: clientele) for over a year.  It shows!   Echo is three shades of awesome - the perfect gal to be running the bar!  Easy smile, quick wit, great sense of humor and the talent to mix a great drink while cooking any of the grub from the menu.  She is a one woman show and pulls it off like a champ! June drink specials included $2.00 Beam 5 Star bourbon, Yukon Jack, and I dont remember what else.  I asked for a bourbon and coke, the roommate asked for his bourbon neat.  (Brave - cheap bourbon *needs* to be cut with something!).  The pour is solid and consistent  Oh, and did I mention you can get a mixed drink, anytime day or night for just two bucks?  For $2!! Two drinks for me, two shots for him, a beer chaser for him and a cheese wineburger split between us.  Under $14!!  Holy hell, its cheaper to drink here than it is at home! And at home - we dont have the entertainment of the other patrons.  Like Cowboy who would do the splits on demand.  And suggest my roommate go through the needed steps for a game of ""rodeo"" with his girlfriend. You just cant make this up! Oh - and he bestowed slightly drunk me with a new nickname. Apparently, I am a ""prick ass bitch.""  I dont know how he meant it, but I am taking it as a compliment and will wear it with pride! Oh, yes.  I will certainly be back!  A LOT."
2,"Gary Betz, DDS with Southwest Dental Group in Phoenix (Ahwatukee) Dr. Betz was nice, but the office...well it seemed to be the unfriendliest, coldest dental office Ive ever been to (out of 6-7 in my lifetime). I used to complain that dentists offices were too full of perky, chatty, overly friendly clones, but now I miss those offices. I saw nary a smile or warm greeting - businesslike efficiency seems to be the norm here. Dr. Betz was friendly and smiled, however. No complaints about him, other than my feeling that everything was rushed. We didnt go over my history or much of anything, but well see if the next visit is better.  Postscript: After getting home from this appt. and reading the horror stories on various review sites relating to ALL Southwest Dental offices, I changed my designated dentist and went to Foothills Smiles instead. Please see my review of Foothills Smiles on Ray Rd."
5,"I have lived all over the US, and I have experienced extreme lows and highs with dentists, but this dental group is by far my favorite I have ever been a patient of. I cant say enough good about them, so I wont ramble.... Just love them."
5,"I honestly have only positive things to say about Postinos since every one of my visits here has been very pleasant. From the valet who is running his ass off to the food and everything in between, this place does it all right! If you go here hungry, you should know that your options are basically a panini, a salad or some bruschetta. Ive had a little bit of everything and for the value and quality you cant go wrong the the bruschetta. I recently determined my favorite to be the ricotta, dates and pistachio but a close second is the salami and pesto. Wine by the glass can be a bit steep so if youre planning to stay for a bit and can agree on a style with your company, you might be better off getting a bottle. A bottle is pretty much 3x the price of a glass so you end up getting 1 1/2 glasses extra. Bonus! Someday, Ill actually take advantage of their $20 deal for wine and bruschetta!"
3,"This was the perfect place for the family after a day at the resort.  The food was good, especially the barbeque chicken.  The kids menu was wonderful.  My only complaint was that the server really could not answer questions about the menu."
4,"This was our third visit and I have to say the service is impeccable. They are attentive, friendly and helpful.  I cant remember what we had our first visit, it was right after they opened and during the awkward stage. The second visit we had pizza it was good, we were looking for deep dish which they dont make but it was good and great service.  Tonight we all had different things: Mostaccioli for my older son he was very happy, cheesy and flavorful sauce. Spaghetti and meatball off the kids menu for the younger boy, sweet sauce and a big meatball another happy boy. Husband had the Chicago Grinder hot and it was gone in a flash and he said it was really good. It looked great on the toasted bread. He also got a salad instead of fries, lots of fresh veggies. I had the Italian Beef with peppers and onions, it comes with Giardiniera and au jus and french fries. The bread was yummy soft yet substantial enough to withstand au jus. The bread was stuffed, stuffed with meat, the peppers and onions were good but the giadiniera made it. It was a really good sandwich. San Tan Brewery on tap - yum. I could give them 5 stars but Ive had better Italian Beef though I will admit Im not an expert.  A great dinner and I hope to return soon."
5,"Kids love Disney, and so do I.  One of my favorite things at this location (as opposed to the AZ Mills location) is the magic princess mirror.  Grab any of the princess items (shoes, tiara, wand, etc) off the rack, and wave the package with the UPC symbol facing the jewels and mirror, and after a few seconds, that particular princess will appear in the mirror with a little story for the kids."
5,"Hertz Gold Club service worked perfectly for me. My Toyota Corolla, booked over the internet, was in its bay and ready to go. The buses to and from the rental centre were frequent and painless to use."
4,"Being a fan of the infamous Roscoes Chicken and Waffles in Long Beach, I was totally down for some chicken and waffles this morning. The bestie found this place because it was close to my new home in Arizona and was sure to be a hearty brekky after all the physical exertion of packing, moving and loading/unloading a Uhaul. So off we went... The place is easy to find and pleasant to walk into. The staff was friendly immediately upon arrival. Service was quick and attentive. The menu is simple but appealing...so are the prices. We decided to go with the traditional chicken and waffle plates to satisfy the savory and sweet tooth. Waffles are big, maple syrup is warm and the chicken is perfectly southern fried.  Im afraid I have to admit that I may now be thinking of LoLos first whenever I hear chicken and waffles. MmmMmm!"
1,"Let me first say that we are fans of the W Hotel and have stayed in many of their hotels around the nation and are overall happy with the accommodations and customer service.   Im a local Phoenician who resides in the Arcadia neighborhood and frequents many of the wonderful restaurants and hotels this City has to offer.  After hearing MANY negative reviews from co-workers, family, and friends, my fiancé and I decided to give the W Hotel Scottsdale a shot prior to forming an opinion of our own for this hotel/restaurant/bar. During a night out on the town with visiting and local friends, we opted to give this place a try.  Upon approaching the entrance of the bar, security tells us that were not welcome here due to one of the members of our party not having closed toe shoes and another not having a collared shirt.  The attire our group was wearing was more than appropriate for any Phoenix/Scottsdale restaurant/bar.  Let me remind you thats is July in Phoenix, and over one-hundred degrees at the time of night we went to the W and the six of us just finished a dinner at an adjacent, popular restaurant.  The staff was flat out rude to not only us, but others in line wanting and willing to spend money and support the local hotel. I will strongly suggest not staying here or supporting the quality of business they are running here.  During a time of a slowing economy and tourism, many businesses are forced to rely solely on the best possible customer service to attract and retain business--the W Hotel fell way short of this. I was very discouraged after our experience here and will agree with the many other reviewers that this place in not worth supporting.   Phoenix/Scottsdale has many great places to experience, so dont settle for this place."
5,"This place gets it right from the moment you walk in the door. Signed baseballs jerseys and bats by legends on the wall, a friendly host to greet you and when you sit down they ask if you want free chopped liver. It comes with bits of egg and onion, warm rye bread and bagel chips.  Our waiter, Jeff, was friendly and attentive, even lending us his flashlight to read an old newspaper story in the rafters. The cream of mushroom soup made from scratch was superb. Our mains were baby back ribs, the specialty of the house, cooked perfectly with a flavorful sauce. The broasted chicken was to die for: moist and juicy with a crispy outer skin. The fries were piping hot, as they should be. And the portions are beyond generous. We topped it off with key lime pie, light and tasty, an ideal complement to the meaty mains. And the bill was under $60, an amazing deal. As a bonus, some of the players drop in during spring training."
4,"This place is a good go to when youre looking for a mexican infused panda express.  Haha.  Yum!  I got the combo meal with the Jade Red chicken made into a quesadilla and the diablo chicken.  Really good!  I also got jerk fried rice.  The beans were also very good.  Yummy in my tummy.  I really enjoyed Chino Bandidos, but dont think I could go more than once during a trip to Phoenix (Id get very large from eating like this!).  :D  Oh yeah, if you want something more than a snack, dont just get a quesadilla by itself.  My poor brother thought the quesadilla would be huge and good enough for his dinner (thinking taqueria size), but it was pretty sad and small.  Luckily, my combo wasnt that small and I had extra food to share."
5,Yen has amazing sushi. I would say that they have the best sushi in AZ. You have to try it to see how amazing it is. The service is great and I feel like I just stepped into Japan. The whole sushi experience is very authentic and perfect place to hang out with friends or take a date :D There is only one thing I dont like. Sometimes it gets to busy so make sure to get there early (around 7 P.M) if you want to be seated right away.
3,"The pizza here is average. Its not bad, but its not the best pizza Ive ever had, either. Was it worth $9.75 for a 12"" personal pizza? No. I paid with a Fox Restaurants gift card, so I cant complain too much about a ""free for me"" meal. I would probably not come back again if it was on my dime. Also, my pizza was a little bit burnt on the crust. It was edible, but I was surprised that they served me slightly burnt pizza at the price of $9.75. My fiances wasnt-- in fact, they remade his entire pizza and didnt even send it out to us because it had a hole in the crust."
3,"We made the trek down from northern phoenix to get some authentic ramen.  I wanted to love this place and I wanted it to be worth the trip, but it just wasnt.  The decor is as previously described - you sort of time warp back to the 80s but it is clean and well loved by its owner.  They do have a lot of authentic menu items and a great kids meal, but the ramen was just not that good.  Its downfall was the broth.  Hubby got the salmon chirashi which was also not that fresh.  If Im in the area, I may give it another try for the don-buris."
5,"This is probably the sweet I crave the most! Salted Butter Caramel! Yummmm! When I cant make it up to Scottsdale, I stop by my local Whole Foods in Chandler and pick up a pint from the freezer section and it is just as good."
4,"This Gamestop is nicely stocked and it is very clean.  When I checked in here, I was picking up a copy of 007: Blood Stone.  It is currently on sale NEW for $9.99.  A fantastic price!   Heres the catch.  I tried their ""Pick-Up In Store"" service, in which you pick out the game online, you enter either your Rewards Card Number (which I have), or you enter your Credit Card number, just to make sure that you arent making a bogus claim.  Then you can go ahead and pick it up right away in store. BUT.  They gave me a USED copy of the game, and wanted to charge me $22.95!  Are you kidding?!  I just saw the ad online, and I reserved a NEW copy for $9.99.  The last thing I want is a colossal mix-up... I dont know how they could have messed this up.   This place would have gotten a 5 star rating, but with the colossal mess up with the pickup, I will only give them 4."
4,"A group of friends and I decided to check out Vincents Saturday Market this past weekend after a beautiful morning hike had worked up our appetites.  When we got there, the place was packed (but still had space to accomodate our group of 6).  It was the perfect outdoor market feel, with fresh vegetables from the garden available for purchase, next to organic lotions and soaps, and all sorts of food stands to whet any appetite (crepes, tacos, paninis, etc).  There was even a mimosa stand, where for $20 you could purchase a bottle of champagne, a glass of OJ, and as many plastic cups as needed.  This is definitely going to be added to my list of favorite places to enjoy a beverage while observing some extremely entertaining people watching!  I loved it, and hope to go again soon!"
1,"Cummings took over the company that we originally used, and since they have taken over we have had nothing but problems. I havent seen a single bug in years in my house and as soon as we started using Cummings weve found a bug almost every single day and not just bugs but cockroaches. I called Cummings to ask them about why this was happening and the receptionist was extremely rude saying they didnt do anything wrong. I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone.  Needless to say I will be finding a new pest control company today."
4,"Ive been to a few Schlotzkys around the valley and this one is actually surprisingly one of the nicer ones.  Its clean with plenty of space for even the largest working group lunch.  Service comes quick, and they have this southwestern sandwich that is great! If youre one of the many people who work for a large company on the Dunlap corporate freeway, this is not a bad place to grab a bite before the second half of your work day. One quick tip - its kind of tough to find, but its a stones throw north of Dunlap on the frontage rd.  You have to go back and around a building to find it though."
1,"Tried a couple Tammie Coe cupcakes and a mini muffin two weeks ago... Unfortunately for them, I also sampled Ollie Cakes... No wonder Ollie Cakes, aka Urban Cookie, won Cupcake Wars and Tammie Coe sits in high rent selling pretty sugar disguised as a cupcake. Drive a few miles north, get whatever the special cupcake of the day is along with a Brown Velvet and Lemon, and save saying you enjoyed Tammie Coe for impressing snooty folk who wouldnt know yummy if it bit them on the butt! Really, the TC cakes were just cakes... No flavor, no texture, dry... And I cant say how impressed I was that the clerk shoved all my selections into one, tiny, flat bag meant for cookies or sandwiches!  Apparently presentation and flavor preservation mean nothing... As their products now do, at least to me."
4,"Ill admit I almost fell outta my chair after hitting a triple-double on the Malibu. Quite generous pours plus delish menu. Cant wait to go back and try out the dance floor!!! Did I mention the Disco Ball?? Yeah, baby!"
4,"Sure, Ill pretend that the main reason I come here is the food and not the super cheap margaritas. It was the... uhh... food that is really good even if I dont remember what I ate. I think there were some fish tacos that were pretty tasty. Okay fine, I go for the margaritas- they are big, cheap and tasty."
3,"Im sad to say that I wasnt in love with MacAlpines.  The fact that the building has never been restored is cool, in a dirty kind of way.  The floors will never be clean enough, because they are so old.  That may seem ridiculous, but cleanliness is important to me when Im eating somewhere. Our server was odd, but helpful and attentive.  We spent a good amount of time oogling the random items displayed throughout and were entertained with our surroundings. The food is where I saw the problem- my Mac Cheeseburger was bland and tasteless.  My broccoli and cheese soup was below average.  I wasnt impressed one bit. We ended up having dessert.  I opted for a single scoop of Chocolate Malt Krunch, which Id never had before and didnt love (total personal preference as my friend loved it).  MacAlpines is cool, but I think purely as a place to get something sweet."
4,"Had a very nice meal in there on 5/10. Bengan bartha was tasty and the only poor part of the meal were the nan breads, they were not at all fresh. Good prices though and good service and Fullers ESB to boot!!"
2,"This place bothers me.  I already everything about country so going to these kind of places freaks me out.  I was forced to go here because the boyfriends parents were in town and they choose Cadillac Ranch due to their type of ""cuisine"". I have to say the foo d wasnt bad.  Server messed up my order but when they got it right it was ok.  I will not go here again however.  Sorry."
5,"I dig the breakfast been to 7th and 38th and had Nans breakfast, Plus have had tamales too so really is something to come back. In 13-years (I live in Cali) been here 26 times and not fancy (although 7th is the one with great pottery and colors inside. I ate 1 time for lunch of dinner and 25 times for brekafast"
5,"I had lunch there recently and was very impressed with the food,  friendly service and excellent value.  I had a lunch special -- two cheeseburger sliders with sweet potato fries.  They serve the burgers with several pieces of fresh crisp lettuce, tomato and onion.  We will definitely go there again."
3,"In the office, Fiesta Burrito is aptly known as ""across the street.""  Kind of like, ""How about across the street?""  ""Yeah, I could do across the street, today.""  If I ever said, ""How about Fiesta Burrito?""  I would get, ""Wheres that?""  Then I would have to say, ""You know, across the street.""  And the response would be, ""Well, why didnt you say so in the first place."" The primary reason we eat at ""across the street"" is because it is convenient - its across the street.  And in the immortal words of my most quotable co-worker, ""It is fast, cheap, and good -- no questions asked.""  The part about it being good is debatable.  I could do with a little less greasy.  Fast, no question.  And despite that fact that ""across the street"" charges 60 cents for spicy carrots now, the prices are low.  I like the chorizo plate with a side of sour cream, although I might start branching out as we eat at ""across the street"" way too much, and Im getting tired of always having the same thing. At just above a dive, I would call it a hole in the wall, but really, it is just a generic Mexican joint that hides in plain sight.  Even the name is rather plain as no one can seem to remember it.  There is a smallish, generic inside dining area, which is accompanied by a small, generic patio for outside dining.  Some high school students seem to come by for lunch leave.  The staff is polite.  Until they move or I no longer work across the street, Ill be a regular."
1,"So far my restaurant experience in Phoenix has been subpar when it comes to service and this one took the cake. Everytime the server came to our table it was just to do one thing and we would be left in the lurch with our mouths silenced in the middle of asking for something. Finally the food came and it was actually quite delicious, I ordered the turkey eggs benedict with potatoes and fresh fruit. However once again the food was dropped off with no silverware, no condiments and no refills on the coffee. I truly hope the restaurant re-trains the staff or hires a whole new batch, because I am afraid food alone can not keep a business afloat."
4,"Been there many times with many friends, not fancy food but decent, fresh, local, organic at a good price with none of the pretentions that one would associate with the whole organic/green mocvement in dining. That being said the food only gets 4 stars based on the price plus the 5 star brownies...food is above average but not by much, the atmosphere and price are what i enjoy most"
5,"I am disabled with MS. The heat of summer about does me in, esp. in the car. Because of this, and because the best thing Ive ever done for myself was to buy an electric Hamilton-Beach water kettle, I drink TEA. All day. Loads of it. Teavana is MUCHO EXPENSIVE, though I adore it. I learned of the Tea District through somebodys ad and like them very much as well. But, I had no idea we had a genuine tea company in Phoenix. And because of HomeRun, I was allowed to buy THREE vouchers. And because DragonFly is so awesome, they let me use all three to buy tea online and have it shipped to me all at once to avoid huge s&h fees. It should be here any day, and I cant wait to try their Cab(ernet) against Teavanas Opus Rouge. I love red heavily tart, fruity teas. It doesnt matter to me if there is no white, green, or black tea in it. In fact, I prefer it to just be the fruit. I drink it hot, and then as it cools all day in my tea pot, I keep refilling and either warm each huge travel mug with lid in the microwave, or drink it room temp, or even add some ice if it is particularly strong. I can EASILY drop $150 at Teavana, or $120 at Tea District and just touch on what I most want. With your three vouchers worth $60, I got to try two bags of every flavor I most wanted, except Peach (as they are out of it, but Holly wrote me several times and made recommendations based on what I had in my cart).   I know I will love it, and go back to order the Peach when it is in stock again. Thank you so much for finding a local treasure and making it accessible.   Sincerely,   Judith Ann Hillard President of Addiction Overcome, Inc., a non-profit foundation Author of The Other Woman at the Well www.addictionovercome.com"
2,"I planned to order chocolate truffles from Truffle Trolley for our wedding favors.  We ordered the sample box to try them out.  They came in about a week and they were packed on ice which was really nice.  However, when we tried them, we just found them WAY too sweet!  We didnt like them so we are looking for something else.  Just make sure you try the chocolate before you buy to make sure you like it."
4,"This place has good fast food, its always clean, and the staff is super nice. SUPER nice.  My kids love the play area and its a lot cleaner than any other fast food play area for sure. We love this place."
3,"We had a large group and they honored our reservation with having the tables ready at our specified time as opposed to getting them ready when we arrived. We had a somewhat set menu.  The tofu dumplings were delicious. Satay chicken was alright.  We had a choice between 3 entrees. I want to give them higher ratings for their service, but the spiciness between the dishes were very inconsistent. You get to choose on a 1-5 scale and finding a dish that suited your desired spiciness was a hit or miss. Some peoples 1-2 were super spicy and others 4-5 werent that spicy. (note: 5 is spiciest)  Also, we had a huge mess with the bill where they put all the appetizers onto one bill for a table, and none on ours. It was quite a mess trying to figure that out. Also, their timing for food was so bizarre. By the time 1 table had basically finished their dinner then the rest of the meals arrived.  Then again, dealing with 40+ people is a lot."
1,"I was really disappointed with my local Baja Fresh tonight.  The lobby, salsa bar and even drink station were very dirty and unkept.  To top that off my salad had old dark colored guacamole and limp lettuce. I hope they read this and will do a better job at cleaning up!"
5,We love Dr Steve!
2,Good service. The waitress was friendly. but the food was just icky and the Place smelled bad! like sewage pipes. I had a glass of wine. there was no way I was going to order a mixed drink while she was tearing the bar down.  I didnt feel good after eating the food. I had a coupon so it made the total bill cheap. But i would have walked out if I had to pay full price because The atmosphere they boast should provide better food. No Not good dont go
4,"Went to Sticklers for the first time today, with a friend who works across the street.  Im a little leary of places that get talked up so much, but Sticklers was everything she talked about and more.   A family friend once told me that the way to tell a good restaurant is how busy it is.  Seems like common sense now, but how many times have you walked into a restaurant with less than 10 people in the whole place and then walked away disappointed? Well Sticklers was packed.  My first impression was ""Crap, the line is 20 people deep and we only have 40 minutes for lunch...theres no way""!  Well I was pleasantly surprised when we got through the entire line, food in hand, in about 5!  The guys and gals that work there are efficient and have it down.  And they showed some great patience for a newbie. The chicken salad and provolone sandwich was outstanding and the hot peppers gave it a great kick.  Word of warning to the lactose intolerant - its a 2-piller!  The atmosphere was active and lively but not overly loud.  We were still able to have a conversation without shouting.  I just wished the people at the next table realized that.  We didnt need to hear about their daughter ""wrongly"" accused of DUI...for the third time!"
4,"This restaurant is truely cultural experience in your mouth---Chinese, Mexican with a dash of Jamaican. Pollo Diablo is fab! Mom and Pop place with some true TLC that goes into the food. The beer and wine was a good selection as well!  Way to Go!"
3,"This goodwill is Alright, I have been to better. Their selection is okay, cleanliness is okay and organization is okay. All goodwills prices are the same, as far as I know. The staff is helpful and I never have trouble finding somebody if I need help."
4,"I go frequently because every day, from 2-4pm, 44 oz. strawberry limeades are on ""happy hour"". But more importantly, chunks of more or less real strawberries come up the straw into your mouth. There are also real limes down in your gargantuan tankard of ice crunch and sweet sweet nectar. For a dollar.  Sometimes I get something big and fried at Sonic and it makes me feel a little gross, but on the whole their food is great if you can handle its intensity of flavor. I should note that I have a very fond memory of eating bacon cheeseburgers (and the aforementioned strawberry limeades) there after a hard days work, but that could have been the heat and poverty of the Tennessee county in which I was day laboring, or my avid youth, or the sheer novelty of my new southern surroundings. I do stick more to drinks and desserts if I go here though. Total Americana - theres a lot of junk to pick through, but you can make your personal choice for something special. I chose limeade."
5,"Five stars is truly deserved For Yasu. This is truly the best sushi in town and some of the best I ever had! I am a big seafood lover and there a lot of ""chain sushi"" places in Arizona that are decent and good for rolls, but if you want quality and authentic Japanese style fish and incredible Sashimi, you need to go to Yasu. There is really no way to describe it till you go, but once you do, you will become an instatnt fan!  Best thing to do is sit at the sushi bar and ask Yasu to make whatever he wants! You wont be disappointed.  The area and building are misleading... However, if you are the kind of person that thinks RA is the best thing since sliced bread and nothing can beat it, this is probably not for you. This is real sushi... Go try and enjoy!"
5,"Spotted Donkey Cantina is amazing!  They have delicious Mexican food, and fantastic margaritas to wash everything down with. You do have to pay for chips and salsa here, so there probably wont be any of that four bowl snacking before your main entrees come, but the medley of salsas it comes with make it all worth it. Ive tried quite a few of the dishes here, and theyve all been excellent.  In no particular order are my favorites: cheddar enchiladas with hatch chiles and rice...spicy! santa fe macaroni and cheese...again- spicy! cod and shrimp tostadas- delicious! shrimp fajitas shrimp tacos And for dessert: fried banana wraps or the mango margarita sundae!"""
5,"If you buy half a duck, you dont get to pick which duck. I lived in China, mainly Guangdong, for three years, and all it really took was a look at this sign, along of course with all the wonderful roasted ducks and pork, to know I had come across a place with bona fides.  Hope Kee has some of the very best Chinese food in town, in my opinion, and is worth the trip from wherever it is in the valley that you live.  I dont know anywhere else in town you can get such good congee, which is actually called ""zhou"" or ""jook,"" and which is a soupy, delicious rice porridge.   Theyre also one of the only places you can get dried scallop soup, which they do an excellent job of.  Dried scallops, a specialty of HK/Guangdong, are one of the most delicious things in the world.  Everything that they make is delicious, and sitting in there listening to the customers and staff talk in Chinese and Cantonese can really take you back to China, if youve had the pleasure of spending time there. Otherwise its just about as close as you can get.  If you want to eat some real Chinese food that is both delicious and approachable, and very reasonably priced, you cant beat Hope Kee.  Get some soup or some congee, some clams with black bean sauce, some greens and some BBQ, and youll see why China and Hope Kee are such hard places to stay away from.  If you do decide to try your hand at duck-picking and buy a whole duck, fear not for wasted leftovers, because roasted duck makes for a very tasty soup."
5,"This is the old location. For current reviews, look up Karens Kreamery Cafe. Here is what I posted for the new location...please give it a chance. I do not know the owners, I just love supporting a good, local business... Great ice cream, super cute store, extremely CLEAN! The ice cream is good, service is always great, and the location is fun (although a little out of the way). The prices are reasonable. I would rather support a locally owned business and pay more than McDonalds prices and less than Cold Stone prices. If you havent been, and plan on visiting in the Summer, bring suits for the kids. There is a nice little splash area right next to a big playground. Karens Kreamery is located in a big park/sports facility. There is also a medium sized skate park. We usually make a fun outing out it. My family loves this place!! Support local businesses!!!"
4,"Ahi tacos, rib tacos and ribs are all good but a little overpriced. Service staff is always top-notch. Both the beer and wine lists are good, mixed and specialty drinks are nicely done."
2,"When I heard about this place I was really excited because it is hard to find really friendly vegetarian food in Tempe.  The atmosphere here is great and very sunny.  It is in a strip mall which takes away from it a bit, but the inside has a funky feel to it.  I always want to like the food, but something is just off every time.  The black bean burger is good, but it comes on an untoasted piece of wheat bread that gets all soggy and falls apart.  Everything else is OK, but why do they do that.  It makes it disgusting.  Put it on a bun like normal people."
4,"Great food and very knowledgable/helpful staff. A little expensive, but the food is definitely worth it Have had pasta on one occasion and salmon on another....loved them both. Will definitely be back to support this great restaurant!"
4,"It was a busy bustling little town perched atop a small hill between the mighty Superstition Mountains to the east and the Goldfield Mountains to the west.    The first gold-strike was made in 1892, and it took just a little under a year before the town came to life. One rich strike after another supported the town and approximately 4000 people who lived in the district for five rich years.    The town boasted 3 saloons, a boarding house, general store, blacksmith shop, brewery, meat market and a school house. Just when it looked like the town would outgrow Mesa, the vein faulted, the grade of ore dropped and the town died a slow painful death. After several unsuccessful attempts to reopen the mines, the town did come to life again from 1910 on and off until 1926."
5,"I grew up at this library.  And now I am old and married and hope to someday take my very own kids to this library.  They have a great selection of audio books.  I am a major audio book fan and this is the place to be!  Clean, safe, you are not bothered by stranger dangers.  I dig this library."
2,"Okay now this is a large chain and on average its okay to good!  and I have been to this place many, many times, but I have to say the last time I went there for the happy hour hot wings (they were dry, over cooked) then I had ordered a steak and seafood combo (Cajun) something but after my second brew I thought it was me, so I had the wife and my son taste it man was it salty!!!!  It tasted like they dropped the salt shaker in the food, but my waitress assured me that could not have happened ""because all there sauces come in bags and are pre-made"" (Gross, that did it for me) I  was outta there with the quickness..."
3,"I am a sucker for a theme restaurant. I have been wanting to visit this place for a while because of their whole gimmick. When you arrive a nurse checks you in, gives you a hospital wrist band, and dresses you in a hospital gown. Seriously, I love a gimmick more than the next person but the Heart Attack Grill is 100% gimmick and only 60% good food. The menu consists of burgers which vary only in the number of patties, french fries fried in lard, shakes, pure sugar coke, and PBR. They have a strict no sharing policy which completely bummed us out because we wanted to order the huge 20 patty burger and split it 3 ways. We ordered 2 single bypass burgers (one of our trio boycotted the burger because of the no sharing policy,) all you can eat lard fries, a vanilla shake, full sugar coke and a PBR. The burgers were ordinary, the fries were ordinary, and the service (aside from being dressed as naughty nurses) was ordinary. The only win was the delicious butterfat filled vanilla shake.  The bill came to around $30, which is a bit pricey because remember only two of us actually had food. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it. It is a gimmick. Heart attack, fat, lard, waitresses dressed as nurses, cook dressed as doctors, sugar, beer...whatever. It gets old pretty fast."
5,Had a celebratory lunch for a colleague today. We had a group of ten. Service and ambiance were great. I had the best burger I can remember. It was Lons special burger; expensive at $16 but worth every penny.  Highly recommend.
2,"If youre into smoke that reeks all over...this is the casino for you.  It sure aint Vegas where you dont smell any smoke.  Peeee---uuuuu!  Stinky. And if that wasnt bad enough:  I went with a group of friends and we all ate at the buffet.  Now, in all honesty, some of the food there was pretty good:  the shrimp, the prime rib beef, the stuffed cheese lasagna, etc. Some was pretty bad like the ceviche  and the desserts--OMG--how bad they are.   My cheesecake was, obviously, a day or two old and had that refrigerator slightly hard crusting over it--plus, ever so slight smell from the fridge. Not yummy.  The pies were alot of filling and few pieces of fruit.  Just cheap desserts, so stick with the meat and fish. Here is the coup de gras, tho.  I was given a $4 comp on my players card.  I went to 3 different machines and they were all BROKEN!   Finally I find one that lit up green so I knew the players card was working. And guess what?  The $4 comp money never showed up on the card. If this Casino thinks I would actually spend money to sit in their stinking cigarette smoke loaded casino, they have another think coming.  Hell no! I also had a ticket to see their Showstoppers ""show"" which, if it sucked as much as their slots and crappy old desserts, I figured it wasnt worth it. On my way out to go home, I pitched both their non-working players card and their ticket to the ""show.""  I knew I would have more fun watching reruns of Sex and the City at home than boring myself even more. Goodbye, Casino Arizona.  You have alot of people in that casino so youre making money off some sucker...just not this sucker. Never again. (2 stars because their fish and meats were really good)"
4,"Well this is truly a hidden gem in Old Town Scottsdale. The wife and I visited this establishment last Sunday after church. There is usually a long wait here...but we arrived about 10 am and there was no wait. We were seated very quickly and the service was very good...there was a little wait for our food but no complaints about that though. I had 2 great buttermilk pancakes, turkey sausage, eggs, potatoes, and hash...the price....only 9 bucks plus tax...a really great deal. So if your ever in Old Town Scottsdale and need a great breakfast to get your day started...visit this establishment. Eat, Drink, and Be Merry my Friends!!!!!"
4,"This was a brand new experience for me, but so much fun!  The staff was very patient and helpful, and we felt perfectly safe after some one-on-training even though we were all newbies.  Only complaint is that the beginners walls were a little crowded, while there were a lot of super advanced walls not being used.  May want to swap the ratio to match the customer base.  But a very good time and an amazing workout.  It may be days before I can lift my arms again..."
5,"Heres the deal. I said I was done with OT, but a friend told me the management had changed and it was worth another shot.  My friend was right. Everything I had a problem with before was remedied. I went in unannounced, didnt tell anyone about a previous bad experience, and I was given some of the best service Ive received in town. When we went in, we were sat quickly and tended to very well for our entire visit. No texting employees, no indifferent waitstaff. The chef was in the food window expediting food, making sure it went out promptly and correctly. Not only was our server attentive, but there was a team service atmosphere and other servers came by our table when we had empty drinks, debris on the table, etc.  The decor has been refreshed, and although I didnt dislike the decor originally, it is definitely an upgrade as well. Now its much cleaner, but still maintains the character that was part of its charm before.  Props to the new management. Well done. Ill be back. PS - forgot to order side syrup. Curious to see if they still charge $2."
4,Went and got some delicious Boba today. Mango and Strawberry Banana.  Guy behind the counter is very welcoming and friendly. :) My choice place for quick to go Boba.
5,"a G Spot is a myth.  and Dr Graffenberg was a mad scientist. So its no surprise that I couldnt find the Gelato Spot either.  Shannon spouts, ""I love gelato so much, I would bathe in it"".  Hmmm, thats interesting I drove in and around the dirt road ... and went up and down Scottsdale  ... explored the box ... looked south of the landing strip at Scottsdale Airpark ... manually googled it ... orally asked the passerbys Road several times and I couldnt find it ANYWHERE Maybe I need to do more research.  Perhaps some field research...Or a targeted focus group *** UPDATE  *** Its on Shea Blvd??  No wonder I couldnt find it- I was looking down the wrong road *** UPDATE  *** Thanks Jake P for ""Yeah it is on Shea, in the strip mall area east of scottsdale rd near the Harkins Theater and Pita Jungle and such.... "" BUT the point of this review was sarcasm.  i.e. g- spot is hard to find *** UPDATE  *** Now I have a girl, ""Shannon W"", telling me where g-spot is.  She writes,  ""Its on 74th St. and Shea, in between Coffee Plantation and Pita Jungle."" Shannon W:  The point of this review was sarcasm.  i.e. g-spots are hard to find"
3,"You have to know what youre looking for to find this place.  Ive passed this location several dozen times and never realized that a restaurant & bar was located underground.  A friend of mine invited me to have a few drinks and some dinner and I was intrigued, so I decided to go for it. We sat at the bar and ordered glasses of Wine and some Oysters.  The bar was packed, but we were able to comfortably enjoy our food and have a conversation.  The food was OK.  The Wine was the house Zinfandel, which was *eh*....but I didnt like the call options, so whatever.....now I know not to order Wine here. Overall, it wasnt too bad of an experience.  Next time, Ill go with a Beer instead of Wine and try sitting in the dining room. Return Factor - 80%"
4,"Ive been here three times once for lunch and twice for dinner. Lunch was pretty crowded, dinner not so much but tons of take out. Prices are cheap and food is good!  I love the beans and I recently tried the guacamole and loved it. Try it out and see for yourself."
5,"I put forth that we need to institute a new standard of measurement to be used for comparing coffee shops.  Furthermore, I think that Cartel Coffee Labs should use this place as a standard for this new unit of measurement. I have to assume its called a ""Coffee Lab"" for a reason.  Too many coffee shops these days are retail stores, where coffee is an incidental thing in all the yelling, stupid names, and fancy colors.  If you look at the menu of Cartel Coffee Lab, there are a total of 13 items.  Its all about the coffee, plain and simple. Then again, theres really nothing simple about it to those who take their coffee as seriously as this place does.  The artistry of their baristas is not to be trifled with.  These people can make a latte so pretty, you really wont want to drink it (until you do, then youre happy you did).  On top of that, the selection of coffee varietals is impressive.  Ive only tried one, but that alone was better than anything Starbucks tries to pawn off on the masses.  Perhaps the use of the term ""Lab"" is because theyve actually stepped beyond anything any other coffee shop has done.  Either way, the formula that they came up with works better than anything Ive come across before. Then again, maybe Im being too hard on the other places.  Its not that they have an intrinsically inferior product, but the reason for these places has been lost behind t shirts and mugs and open mic nights and selling you a card containing the same money youd use on the place anyway... I digress.  Cartel Coffee Labs is a great place with a fantastic product.  If their WiFi is weak or the back corner gets dark, I honestly dont care.  Their coffee is excellent and Ill be coming back for more."
4,"Had myself a new york striploin and it was quite good although I do hate paying these kind of prices for steak.  I really thought the vegetables were more special than the steak, but if you compare what kind of quality steak you get here compared to say Donovans (high quality steakhouse in CA), Ive got to say that I like the overall package presented at Keg Steakhouse with respect to the quality and price."
3,"I moved in here a few ago and I do like it for the most part. The grounds are kept clean and tidy, except for some irresponsible pet owners. Some of them even let their pets run around leash-less or cannot control them. But that is not the managements issue. Pros: 1. The apts are spacious, well-built. 2. Grounds are clean and grass is maintained. 3. Pool is well-maintained. 4. Online system for rent pay and maintenance tickets is great. 5. Price is great for the value. Cons: 1. Apts not sound-proof or heat-proof. 2. Sprinklers tend to sprinkle more water over the sidewalks than the grass area. 3. Covered parking is extra $$$ and not enough of them anyways. 4. Uncovered spots are all just crowded in the parking lot at the back. 5. Security gates are open most of the time from the front and have gaps that could let an adult through on the sides. 6. Outer compound Walls are not high enough to actually prevent/make it difficult for an intruder. 7. Fitness center is adequate at best. Most of the free weights and equipment (except the machines) are broken or missing. The machines work ok, but are not maintained well. 8. Leasing office employees could use a bit more smile and inter-personal skills."
4,"Why pay full price for mens clothing when you can find quality used items here? Well Suited consistently has an excellent selection of suits, sportcoats, slacks, dress shirts and golf shirts. You can also trade in your old clothing for store credit or cash. The credit is good at any of the different stores in the My Sisters Closet chain, including all of their stores that carry mens and womens clothes, furniture and kids apparel, furniture and toys."
3,Pretty tasty dogs.  Pretty long wait for a hot dog.
4,Sometimes you just gotta have a burger.  I was in the Scottsdale Rd/Grayhawk area and noticed this place where Nicks used to be.  I tasted their burger at the Scottsdale Culinary Festivals Burger Battle and thought it was really good. The CB&CB burger with tater tots really hit the spot for lunch.  The burger and carmelized onions worked together really well.  The tater tots were delicious. Overall it was a satisfying meal and Ill be back soon.
4,"I think half the fun of a used bookstore is the treasure hunt.  This used bookstore is better organized than some of my old haunts in Dallas but I will survive. I think of used bookstores similar to looking through your Grandmothers attic at her book collection - it isnt supposed to be all shiny and new. Bookmans has a decent selection of books, Ive found an entire collection of Rishdie one afternoon! Of course it is always going to be a crapshoot but that is just the way it is in used books."
3,"My husband and I tried this place out since it is fairly close to our house and gets decent reviews.  I drank, my husband ate.  The wine selection is ok and the staff seemed friendly.  My husbands dinner was okay.  Id probably give this place better reviews had they not attempted to give themselves a $15 bump on their tip.  Id also probably give them better reviews if the manager would have called me back after leaving a message with a staff member about the charge especially when I left all the details necessary to fix the issue and was promised a call back that afternoon when the manager arrived.  Now, I can only assume it was not an inadvertent mistake since they give me no reason to believe otherwise.  I really would rather not have to keep calling back and chase my $$ down. Edited review - took them from 1 star to 3 stars since I received a phone call today from a manager and was advised it was a mistake and they credited me back the funds.  Also will be sending me a gift card for the trouble.  Overall, I appreciate the follow up and their efforts to fix the issue and bring me back in.  I was routing for them since the patio seems like a pretty chill place to have some drinks and unwind."
2,"This place is great - IF YOU LIKE TO BE IN A SNOBBY ENVIRONMENT!  There are not too many places that Ive been to that are more hype than anything.  But this is one of them.  When you try to go to THE PINK TACO, its impossible to find a parking space.  Once you make your way to the front, the hostess is always too busy texting her friends than interested in helping the customer!!  If you are lucky enough to find a seat at the bar, you better have a rolex watch on or you will not be served quickly.  Either that, or you better be a Hugh Heffner spouse.  I tried the burrito and was grossed out by how rubbery it was."
4,"My husband and one year old son dined here on a Saturday night. Service was great, food was delicious, and the BYOB was much appreciated! Staff was very accomodating with our baby. :)"
1,My brother also posted about our Mothers Day experience. These must be franchises because the Scottsdale and Chandler locations are like eating at a different restaurant entirely. This is the second and last time we will frequent this location. The pizza and calzones were awful.
5,"I was truly impressed by the quality of service and the knowledge of the employees. I have had my ears pierced at Claires when I was 4 (way to go, Dad!) and an industrial piercing performed at Club Tattoo. I went in to adjust my bar bell for my industrial piercing and they explained a lot of things I had no clue about, like the difference in threading. The place is clean and every one is friendly. I will ONLY ever go to HTC when I need to handle my current piercings or want to get another. Thank you!"
5,"Beer is awesome (first timers must do the beer flight sampler) and I have never had a meal that wasnt excellent!   A quick note, there isnt a/c in the building so keep that in mind during the summer months - although that doesnt stop anyone from going, the place is always jumping!"
4,"The workers here are SO friendly. The minute you walk in the door youll here a ""Hello, welcome to paradise!""  and if you stay to eat/study/chat youll probably hear it every few seconds. I love coming here to study. They have lots of chairs and booths that welcome it and the staff, of course, does not care how long you sit.  Food is decent. There are better bakeries in general but I can say that their cookies and salads are worth trying."
4,Breakfast is fantastic.  Work on the coffee selection.  Only thing holding back a star is no French press coffee or an espresso machine
2,I dont know how this place stays in business. The menu is so limited. Would you like chicken or chicken? Chicken in a pita? Chicken on some lettuce? Chicken rolled in a tortilla? And the pita chips are bland! Yuck! And  the potato salad has something in it that is way too tangy. Ive only been twice and tried different dishes both times but I just dont get anything greek about this place.
2,"So I have been to the location in Tucson and now experienced this one and I have to say that I did not have a WOW or YUMMM drooling moment at either. Dont get me wrong its not horrible it just has no wow factor at all to me and I will pass next time. There is just better Mexican cuisine out there,,, Service was promt though!"
4,"We had my husbands birthday party here.  The staff could not have been more accommodating.  They made everything easy! Our friends loved the place and the band (ReGroove) and had a wonderful time.  Drinks are well-priced and very generous.  The owners and staff truly want customers to be happy, comfortable, stress-free and to have a good time!!"
5,"Heres how to do Pizzeria Bianco the right way: 1. Show up at 3:30 or earlier to get a good place in line. Make sure you bring some friends to enjoy the time together and the great food. 2. At 4:00, the bar opens. Get yourself a bottle of wine and make the best of the 90 minutes youll spend just waiting to get on the seating list. 3. Order a few appetizers from the bar; theyre light and fresh and yummy. 4. When you finally get seated for dinner, dont hold back. Order salads, share different pizzas, and have a coffee after. The quality of the food is ABSOLUTELY worth the wait. We tried eating here a few times over the past couple of years, but realized it takes commitment and two bottles of wine to make it through the line. Best pizza Ive had since Italy. Bravo Bianco!"
1,"I was looking into gyms around the area. Upon entering I was greeted by the front desk guy. I asked about memberships and then he said, ""Sorry we are sold out"". I stood there stunned. Then he snickered, ""Just kidding"". Trying to be a good sport I went with it.  Next came the young sales guy. He was personable - at first anyways. Showed me around the gym and I was interested in joining. Next we went over to the childcare area since I have a little one. Children were in the room however the two girls monitoring the room were chatting it up with one another and ignoring the kids. Bad sign. I asked the girls if they were CPR certified and had fingerprinting and background checks. The world stopped for just a moment and they stared at me. I had interrupted their important conversation. Then they were both saying, ""Yeah, like, well, um, no, I mean yes,"". In other words, no straight answers.  We sat at the sales guys desk and the wheeling and dealing began. I felt like I was purchasing a new car. ""If you choose option A, you then can go to all the gyms."" ""If you choose option B, then only here"" . The whole time I could see the childrens area and the kids were being completely ignored (and we are talking very little children). When I told the sales man I needed to think about it he switched into some type of Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde routine. ""Well you only have today to make a decision, after that no price guarantee!!!""   From there he was down right rude. I walked out of there thinking what the heck just happened. Like Sarah G, I felt horrible when I left this gym.  It was an awful experience. Ended up getting a membership at Tangible Fitness on 7th Street. They dont have the same amenities however it is locally owned, and the people are very nice there."
1,veerrrrrryyyyyyyyy dirty. I think I will buy them some clorox wipes and light bulbs for their sign out front. I made 12 u-turns trying to find this place.
1,"Lets talk about failure, baby. Hey, if your idea of salad is punishment via tasteless lettuce and mealy tomatoes splashed with the most generic, industrial vinaigrette, youve found just the right place to BDSM your tongue. Go for it! I ordered Capellini Checca, and I had it substituted with Spaghetti (I like more girth re: pasta).  What I got was the limpest pile of spaghetti that couldnt be revived with a lifetime supply of Viagra.  The DOA pasta was topped with a pathetic sprinkling of more mealy tomatoes (the menu says Fresh Roma Tomatoes- these had the texture and taste of a dying horses ass moreso than fresh produce).  The faint, acrid garlic tasted like it came out of a shaker bottle and not a bulb- and motherf*&k, respectable Checca should have more than 1/16 teaspoon of microscopically chopped basil.   This place makes Old Spaghetti Factory look like fine dining, and I would rather starve than be even close to that chain restaurant of culinary doom.  Hell, this place is the  disowned, cracked-out junkie brother of OSF. Its really *that* terrible. I gave them the single star only because the management was incredibly lovely, and did not charge for the unforgivable disaster masquerading as edible food worth paying for."
4,"I have been dying to go here since a coworkers spouse is one of the chefs. We finally went  last night  before the Symphony and it was a very good dining experience. The food came impossibly fast. The shrimp and Sausage Po Boy sliders were heavenly. The bread is this roll type of joy like break back east. Yum. You know the type of bread you cant find in AZ or west of the Rockies as Al Pacino would say-lol!They also served the bread basket with a veggie type of garnish if mixed with butter and put on the bread it had a very pleasing taste to it. Innovative menu- Lobster Potpie and Duck Quesadillas. HMMMMMM! Interesting. I had a side of Mac and cheese which is what I had heard about for so long and a Caprese Salad. My friend had divine Salmon. I am not a Salmon fan but i tasted it and it was yummers. My Ice tea was tasty and my friend had  a Basil Mojito that was mixed well. I dont like them usually because they are so strong mouthwashy tasting, but this had a nice blend to it. The restaurant decor is beautiful.We did not get desert but I want to go back and try those Seasalt sticks. All in all I loved going here. DT was packed last night due to Wrestle-Mania but we were in and out  in an hour at 5ish, so try that time to avoid crowds. Service was great despite other reviews. I know great service and I had it."
3,"So Im not a big Chinese food fan, but my husband is. Truth be told, it usually makes me sick. But if I were to go to Chinese food, Dragon Palace would be one of the places that I would go. The food is decent and theres a lot of it. I really felt I was getting my values worth. The waitstaff was attentive (always there asking if I wanted a refill) and the food came out quickly. It looks like every other Chinese food restaurant in the world (lots of red and gold, lanterns, paper Chinese Horoscope place mat -- save for the deep teal walls).  Im not sure I would make a long drive to Dragon Palace because chances are you have a comparable Chinese food restaurant nearby, but if you live in the 32nd St. and T-Bird vicinity, this is certainly a Chinese food place worth trying.  As for the food, we ordered the Peking dinner for 2 which came with won ton soup, a pu pu platter (consisting of won tons - yum -, eggroll, a small fried shrimp, a skewer of glazed beef and honey chicken), Peking fried rice (fried rice with shrimp, chicken, pork and beef), Mongolian beef and the house chicken. (as an aside and a disclaimer, I am preggers right now and I have developed a severe dislike for chicken which means I, of course, hated the chicken dishes). My husband thought it all was ok. I really liked the won ton soup and the Peking fried rice. After dinner, we got the requisite fortune cookie (""Express yourself now."" WHAT?) and a really yummy banana wrapped in a won ton and fried with a sugar glaze thing. All in all, it was a good time at a pretty good Chinese Food Restaurant."
5,Best chocolate croissants EVER!!!!
2,Ive fequented here often enough to know that all the majority of the games here are all those ticket games and little claw type games. I come to hang out with friends and play some games. I can in on tuesday night around 6pm and thought to have dinner there since I had a coupon for the place. I really didnt care about price at the time with the coupon.  After being seated our waitress got our drinks took our order and everything was fine. After we recieved the food we were left unattended for quite some time. When the waitress finally returned I had to ask for a refill and some ketchup as well. My drink was empty so I would assume that would be something that the waitress would ask but I caught her before she left. My boyfriend did not recieve a single refill the entire night and we were there from 6pm to 9pm. We had friends meet us there and we just chatted it up for some time. It wasnt for some time that we realised that the place was bare not just of customers but of staff as well. It was as if they closed the place down and just left us. After the waitress had taken our check and cashed us out that was the last we saw of her. The plates of our food were still in front us the entire time and we had kind of placed them all together so that she could come and just take them...kind of thought that the bunch of plates stacked together would give the hint we were done but I guess I shouldnt be so subtle next time.  The food was ok at best. Nothing bad nothing good in hind sight though if I had to pay full price for what I got if that waitress had left us like she did and I didnt frequent the games I wouldve walked out. Probably wouldnt notice.  All in all go for the games if anything else. The games are even ok that is IF they are running. Sometimes I come in and games are off or not working. This is just a place that is convienent for myself and friends to meet up.
3,"The meat shop has 100% grass fed beef, which means that they also finish their beef with grass (alfafa) which cant be said for every place that claims to have grass fed beef.  This is great if you are trying to eat food the way its supposed to be, none of that factory farming... However the same cant be said for the pork.  The pork (or at least the bacon) contains nitrates which keeps me from eating it.  The farm that provides the pork also feeds the pigs grain. This place would be perfect if they were able to get pigs and chickens that are pastured centered and not fed grain as part of their diets.  Until then Ill stick to their great prices on the grass fed beef and obtain my chickens and pork from somewhere else."
1,I work right across the street and a few of us went here for lunch one afternoon. I ordered a salad to go. As soon as I saw the guy grab shredded sandwich lettuce to make my salad I almost told him to stop but I didnt. I regreted it when I started to dig in and realized the lettuce was brown and yellow. Very disappointed. $6+ bucks for nasty lettuce tomatoes and green peppers. I ordered a salad thinking I was getting something like the picture on their website. I wont be returning here. Ill be passing on lunch next time the co-workers opt for this place.
3,"It is a total dive bar...If you need a drink go get one.  There are pool tables, shuffle board, video game or two, and a jukebox.  The bartenders know their stuff.  Enough said!"
5,"Brown bag chicken sammich, mac n cheese, fried okra, and the bourbon drink.  Nuff said."
4,Their Bruschetta selection was absolutely amazing.
5,"I love that this Safeway is right across the street from my work. I like to walk here for a bit of exercise to get lunch. The deli is awesome. They have a sandwich bar that has these really great gourmet ingredients they will make a sandwich for you. For 5.49 its not too bad and if you use your Safeway card you buy 7 get the 8th sandwich free. They also have premade salads and a hot bar as well. Very friendly, Alan who has made my sandwiches the last couple weeks is very friendly and does a good job. Bonus points the Starbucks is right next to it!"
2,"The place has a nice little vibe going on and they have some unique items but the reason the rating is so low is that there really arent a lot of options that dont involve faux meat.  Arent these people vegan?  Dont they hate the idea of poor little animals being our food (even though that is the only reason they are alive)?  Then why so much FAKE MEAT?!   I will never understand the meat envy vegans and vegetarians have.  I go to a place like this to get a dish that uses vegetables in more creative ways, not to get some overly processed soy products that arent nearly as healthy as fresh lean meats like chicken and fish.  FYI, I love meat but every once in a while I like to grab a vegetarian dish.   Another negative is nearly everything is fried.  Guess they bust the myth that people are vegan because it is healthier.  Frying things is the cheap way out of actually creating a healthy AND tasty meal.   Ill give them a 2.5 star because what we chose was quite tasty.  But with nearly every option involving faux meat and tofu it really is a disappointment.  If you want legitimate vegan fare try out some indian places or Ethiopian places.  They are very creative and using spices to flavor a vegetable dish. The fake cheeses and meats are for Vegans with meat envy, not for Omnivores that just want a good meal.  Keep your expectations in check and you should be okay."
5,"We went here for my wifes birthday, and its a rare 5-star review for me. They scored on food, presentation, service and atmosphere. We sat indoors - its a bit hot out still - and loved the decor, including the fun pillows on our large booth seat. Service was prompt, friendly, and attentive - but we never felt rushed. They make a killer mango mojito that perfectly balances the mango, lime and rum flavors. The kurobuta pork was perfectly prepared. And after having some disappointing lobster (in Maine of all places) the Maine lobster here was done just right - firm but not tough. They serve it ""lazy style"" and did a great job with both claw and tail meat coming out perfectly. A special birthday souffle topped the evening off. Expensive but absolutely worth it for a special occasion."
4,"Tasty Kabob is kind of a throw away name, but the service and food are excellent. The hummus is good, not the best I have ever had, but it is better than many places I have been to. The chicken kabob was excellent, I am not sure how they spice the chicken shwarma, but it is excellent. I had the gyro platter and that was also excellent.  What I really do not understand is why Pita Jungle is so packed and this place is empty. The food is more authentic and frankly tastes better in my opinion. No more Pita Jungle for me. When I am in the area, I will go to Tasty Kabob."
1,"I decided to try qwest as I was tired of Cox continually raising their rates. BAD CALL! Cox may cost a little more but is completely worth it. If I wasnt locked in to a BS contract I would switch back right now. Internet: I signed up for their ""Heavy Duty"" internet @ 20 Mbps. I regularly test less than 2Mbps on dslreports.com. The best I have ever seen is a little over 5. When I call to try and get it fixed they tell me there is no guarantee on speeds. That is why they advertise ""up to"" 20 Mbps... Phone: Extremely poor sound quality, very loud static and crackling, shocking as this is what they should be good at. I called to complain they explained we would have to pay to have technician look at it. This was the day after install!! Helpful hint, call back and tell them you want to cancel your account. The customer loyalty group is actually decent, they sent out a tech free of charge. He fixed it after a couple of hours, but acted completely put out that we wanted a clear line... The bundle: Ah my favorite part and what has finally pushed me over the edge to submit a review...  I went with a bundled package (phone, cable, internet). The plan I signed up for was $147 a month. The first bill was $147, the second bill in Im at $272.43. I cant make any sense out of the bill so Im not sure why they think i owe this much. I love the fact that I will get the pleasure of wasting another hour plus of my day tomorrow talking to these fools.  The day this contract is up Im going back to Cox and Ill be happy to pay more!!"
4,What can I say - I love this place!  I was introduced to it by a group of 20 something friends so I was a bit worried going there (Im no longer of that age group.)  Turns out I had nothing to fear!  Roosevelt is perfect for a glass of wine with the hubby or post dinner cocktails with a group of friends.  Still have a the munchies after dinner - there is a great food menu selection as well.
4,Love Sweet Tomatoes!  My favorite is their Won Ton Chicken Happiness salad!  Although it can be expensive it is a great alternative for fast food!
1,"I give this location no love.  We went to this one rather than the one uptown on a Saturday night with a voucher from another location from a bad sushi upchuck experience.  Going late at night with a mostly empty restaurant, we still ended up waiting 10 minutes to be sat, then SHOVED and I mean shoved in next to the only other table in the place - the hostess snickered at me when I kindly asked to move a single table down (really sick of bitchy hostesses in Scottsdale by the way - your job is not that hard so shut up and color for christs sake)  Our waitress took another 10 minutes just to greet us, sushi took forever, and if you can believe it the fun hadnt even begun yet.   When paying the bill, we present the voucher to the waitress, who says she cant take it.  The manager came over with a bitchy look, basically trying to call it bull shyt and continued to give us the 5th degree about it for the next few minutes - certainly NOT appreciated.  She takes it to the point where she calls the other location where we got it (taking ANOTHER 10 minutes) and finally gives us our bill back - only taking off our 2 rolls and 2 nigiri.  This created one pissed off yelper instantaneously. Dont bother with this location - you could find bomb shrapnel in your soup and they still wouldnt give a damn.   And for the sake of all that is holy - STOP WITH THE CRAZY IM-TOO-SEXY-FOR-MYSELF SCENE!  YOURE NOT THAT COOL!"
5,We went today after lunch. I got my usual of lime basil and real mint chip (which I love for the real mint leaves) and my hubby got chocolate guiness and four peaks hop knot. Best ice cream in Phoenix! The staff is always super nice. They give us ice bags to take our ice cream home :-)  Love this place
4,"I have never eaten a regular meal here. I usually go for the reverse happy hour from 10-12pm. Cheap drinks, good food and a good atmosphere. The servers here are good. I dont eat sushi myself, but everyone I go with loves the Crunchy Crab Rolls.  They have three different pizzas, pepperoni, BBQ chicken and cheese. I have had the pepperoni and BBQ chicken. Both were extremely good. I definitely recommend that someone looking for a good time, cheap drinks, and good food."
5,"I come here probably at least once a week. The prices are right, theres a good variety of ""ethnic"" food, the cashiers are quick and friendly, and theyre just helpful. I locked myself out of my car when having a space-cadet moment and they let me use their phone to call AAA to bail me out.  Fresh flowers + great selection of wine and cheese + all the essentials  They deal is that they cut out the middle man to get great prices for quality products and they dont have sales because they always sell their products at the best price possible. =) GO TJS!"
4,"Just spent two years in Austin eating BBQ from all over the state. This place is legit.....for Phoenix. WORLD CLASS sausage and excellent brisket!   Sides were average.  Nothing much exciting there. The bread was killing both me and the quality of the meat. The sauce is too sweet.  It would be great for St. Louis style ribs, but this is Texas...put some spice in there."
4,Great fried fish and crispy onion rings....yum!
4,"Awesome pizza, great cocktails, and salads. Friendly staff. A favorite!"
1,"Be VERY, VERY careful asking for a sandwich as a wrap. I ordered a ham and cheese make your own sandwich, ordered it as a wrap to go. I got home, theres lettuce and mayo and... what this? whats this I see in this sandwich? theres the cut-off fingertip of someones glove lodged between the lettuce? (At least I hope its the finger tip of a glove - Im not even going to think of the other thing it could have been.) Ewwww.... gross.... I didnt finish the sandwich. Memo to self: Dont ever get wraps from Einsteins, particularly not the one on Shea. Disgusting. If it ever happens again, Im calling a local news station to report it, then Ill call the state health department. Gross, gross, gross, gross, gross, gross... if you cant deliver sanitary wraps, THEN DONT PUT THEM ON THE MENU. Not a place to go if you like wraps."
3,"This place confounds me... They have an excellent beer and wine selection. As a matter of fact, their beer selection is one of the best Ive seen in AZ. Tons of micro-beers and many different and unique bottles of rare Euro- brau. For the selection, to stop by and pick something up and go, this place is great. As a restaurant/Wine Bar bar, I give this place a big...Meh. The service was terrible. Of the party of 6, everyone that ordered a glass of wine, only got one. They sat with their glasses empty for at least 30 minutes. Those of us drinking beer, just walked over to cooler and grabbed a beer. We also had an appetizer. We got the warm pretzels with gourmet mustard. It was frozen pretzels they microwaved with Honey mustard. They were still cool in the middle and a little stale.  Maybe it was just an off night or something, Ill probably give it another shot."
5,"Never thought Id review a supermarket, but since its tough times for alot of people out there, Id like to share my 2 cents.. First of all, you dont need a card.  The deals are for everyone and it makes it hassle-free during checkout.  Now, about the deals ~ I find that Albertsons has the lowest prices and best deals and you can find them amonst any product youre looking for.  Its WAY cheaper than Safeway for sure. This is what i found yesterday:  88 cents for 2 (yes two!) snicker bars or other comparable chocolate bars, $1 for a bag of lifesavor hard candies, and $14.99 for a 24 bottle case of coors light.  They also had 69 cent bags of frozen veggies that people were buying like crazy.  Also, this location has really good cuts of meat.  Im Korean and was so excited that they had short ribs cut perfectly for Kalbi jjim (korean braised shortribs), and for $3.99 a pound, it was quite a deal!"
5,"I just love Chipotle. Fresh, yummy, spicy (if you want it to be). And the restaurant was clean a HUGE plus! My personal fav is the chicken burrito, no rice, no beans w/ fajita veggies, pico, cheese, sour cream, and lettuce. Guacamole and hot sauce on the side. So delicious!!! The person who did our order was so nice! It was my friends first Chipotle experience! She was impressed by how big the burrito was. Im glad I only live a few blocks away... because I will be back."
4,"I didnt stay here, but patronized their restaurant. The servers were very polite and accommodating. They frequently refilled our drinks and aimed to serve by making sure the fireplaces were working. Its a nice place to hang at if you have a reason to be here."
5,"This wasnt the first time, but we went to Tutti Santi for a family Christmas Eve Dinner.  All I have to say is that everything was simply perfect.  Not only the food, but the service.  Which to me makes a restaurant with great food go from good to great.   I ate the lamb shank- Angello Dorato, which fell off the bone and was delicious. I cleaned the plate.  Dad had the veal marsala with fettuccine alfredo.  The veal was fantastic and the alfredo was just right. The sauce was not too thick-not to thin.  Dad cleaned the plate.  From him being in the food industry for 30+years and eating in many italian establishments both here and Chicago, believe me that says more than alot.    Mom had the special of the night, which was a cioppino with tons of seafood.  When most italian restaurants serve this dish at least one of the seafood items will be rubbery or fishy tasting (not in a good way) especially the mussels.  Not here. Everything was the way it should be. I felt this was the plate of the evening out of 3 great dishes.   Mom didnt clean the plate, she has a small stomach.  But I will be eating the leftovers in about two hours after I sleep off my meal. Everything from the bread, the calamari fritti, to the tiramisu was fabulous.  Im glad we couldnt get reservations anywhere else for this special meal.    Gratzi and Buon Natale. Oh yeah, I didnt get the raviolis this time, but if youve havent had them its a must try."
4,"Hey, art is very personal so I wont pretend to be objective about jordre studio.  What I can tell you is that anyone who has the cajones to open their own studio and, more importantly, the staying power to be an ongoing entity is deserving of praise.  I have a friend who owns several of Kyles pieces and they look spectacular. If, like me, you look for a personal connection with your art, youll be hard pressed to do better than JS.  Kyle is outgoing and personal and, if youre especially nice, hell share a Schwanns ice cream sandwich with you.  How about that for an artistic connection?!"
3,"I like to call this ""My Bashas"".    On the positive side, the selection of wine and beers is pretty extensive, the produce is fresh with quite a few organic choices.  The natural foods section has a number of pleasant surprises and theyve added some new bulk dispensers there as well.  Ive had mixed experiences getting help in the meat section but the checkout up front is always quick, much faster than some of the other grocery store chains out there."
4,"Went to the Rooste for a Christmas Eve dinner among a small group (9) friends. I had never been. Had heard the name many times over the years when I had previously lived in Tempe.  Been intimidated that by where it set that it was expensive and swanky. Thats all a lie! It sets up high and has a wonderful view. Its not located where you are just strolling down the street and decided to pop in that is true. You wind through these grounds to the back of the property pass beautiful fountains and buildings until you come to the lite up restaurant. You can self park but why bother go for the valet.  You pass a smelly ranch steer at the entry that is probably wondering why the hell its there as much as I was. Inside the door the smell escapes you immediately, thank goodness. You see some young sap making cotton candy and wonder what the heck have I arrived at. A few more steps and you see you are in a western theme establishment, by the overwhelming amount of raw wood beams and flooring.  First stop the bar. Its a limited full bar and for this it losses a star.  From the bar the view outside is great and you can look down and see the country music band playing (it was a band but I wouldnt book em) but hey they gave the place a little extra pulse. You see the staff in casual western gear also and you instantly know youre welcome in your jeans.  Moments later our table was ready and half of us choose to take the slide down to the dining floor and the others took the steps. Hey I went for the slide! It was short and fast and another reason to come casually dressed.  Our waitperson was a delightful and articulate young woman. We skipped the appetizers to leave room for dessert (next time Ill reverse that decision). The menu was very good. Several steak cuts, enchiladas, fried chicken, BBQ beef & pork ribs, Seafood, a burger, pork chops, most plates $15 - $20.  While waiting for the salad course a magician name Flash comes up and asks if wed like some magic that night (he works for tips). He went about his tricks and blew our minds! THIS GUY I WOULD HIGHER for an event. Never figured out how he did what he did but would love to see him doing it again and again. So if he comes by your table take him up on his offer of magic.  The food arrives, the salad is good and fresh the main courses come and all are cooked to perfection. My medium rare T-Bone was actually medium rare for once! My steak was tender and taste fabulous. The food didnt hold its heat well and they serve sweet potatoes or rice with the dishes rather than standard baked/mashed or fried Idahos (extra charge for a standard potato - why? - Minus another 1/2 star). But over all it was a good meal. We barely had room for the dessert so we split a 9 layer chocolate fudge cake and another dessert among us. And we still had four or so layers of cake left to go home! It was so rich and such a huge slice no 3 people could have eaten the entire thing following a meal if they tried... 4 of us dug into this slice.  All in all it its a great steakhouse. Prices lower than Lonestar and Steak portions (ounces) bigger for your money, plus a better all over food and appetizer menu by far. Oh yeah Im a fan and will be returning again and again when I want a steakhouse to fill my steak cravings and a bit of entertaining to accompany the meal.  I highly recommend Rustlers Rooste."
5,Nobody likes going to the auto body shop..period!  These guys took a negative situation and absolutely turned it around. They immediately made me feel at home from the moment I approached the front desk; all the way up to the ownership of the shop. It was a professional experience with a family friendly approach. The work they completed on the rear bumper of my car was excellent. I HIGHLY recommend Impact AB for your AB repair needs. Tom Butka was a pleasure to work with. Thanks Impact AB for everything!
4,"This is my favorite Tapas joint in town. Its a place I have to get the same thing everytime and maybe more to try a few new items... my must haves are: Island Gingered Yam & Pumpkin Bisque Soup (Seasonal)... so good and the fact that its seasonal makes it even more of a special treat. Camarones Al Ajillo (Garlic Shrimp)... this is my all time favoreite dish thus far @ Havana... I can eat it as my meal as long as they provide me as much of their tasty bread as I need to sop the dish dry of all the yummy garlic sauce it contains. Maduras Fritos... Fried plantains... need I say more? Mojito... best in town in terms of authenticity. Marquesas de Chocolate aka Chocolate Pate... I never cared for dessert here until I tasted this strangely named treat. It is so rich at first you think it will be too little but then you realize you need to share with everyone at your table. Other worthy options:  Arroz Con Pollo... It has baby peas in it and I really dont like peas... but I like them in this dish! I got to try this dish because a friend ordered it as his meal and didnt even make a dent in it... so I got all the leftovers and it was pretty tasty and economical! Fritoras de Frijoles Negros... Ive never had Black Bean Fritters before--they are quite tasty dipped in Guacamole! Calypso Chips...A thinner more chippy version of Fried Plantains. Sun Spots... Sweet Potato Fritters pretty tasty as well... for a fried root vegetable! Datiles Con Chorizo... A meatier appetizer... not the best Ive had but pretty darn good. Empanaditas... These are alright... though Im partial to Filipino style Empanadas... but since I have no place to buy them from, nor have I mastered making them, these are quite good for a band-aid craving. Tamal Cubano... pretty tasty, but my fave is the soupier Salvadorean take on the chicken tamale. Flan... havent had it, but flan consistency throughout varying cultures seems pretty consistent. Free Goodness: Their Bread! Its just the way I like it, hot, thin and crisp crust and soft in the middle! As you can see, outside of the Arroz Con Pollo, I have not tried many of their entrees... Im quite content to dine with others and share Havanas wonderful tapas... but one day I WILL try their Paella. A vegetarian friend said they make a veggie paella that was pretty tasty... and she loves their Mojitos just as much as I do so I think she may be right on this one. Cant wait to try it... with a side of Camarones al Ajillo and a Mojito!"
3,"Unlike a lot of the other reviewers, I actually had a decent experience here. We came in yesterday (Sunday) around 2. The place was pretty quiet, excluding the plethora of football fans who came here to watch their games. They have a ton of TVs to do so, including a HUGE screen that was playing the Cardinals game. No complaints about that. Some of the guys were rowdy but hey so am I when I watch football. It took us a while to be seated. Im not quite sure where the hostess was. As soon as we were seated we were helped by a very pretty and sweet girl. Our food took a while even though the place was pretty dead, but what we got was satisfying. We started with the nachos which were really good and then I got their jalapeno burger and my friend got their pork sandwich sliders. The fries were seasoned well and crispy. The service needs some work: nonexistent hostesses, disappearing servers, slow cooks, but this place could be a real gem."
5,"Grassroots is right around the corner and we drive by it every week on our usual Friday-Dinner-Out.  I always assumed it was more of a pub than a restaurant.  My wife and I arrived around 5:00pm and were seated immediately.  The waiter was super attentive and knew the menu and preparation of everything I asked about.   We started with an AMAZING appetizer special of burrata* with ciabatta tips, their house spicy tomato jam and arugula with champagne vinaigrette.  It was described as a sort of an experimental combination of preparations from other dishes.  The burrata was silky smooth and spreads onto the ciabatta like softened cream cheese.  The play of flavors in this dish was excellent, wed go back here just for this dish alone. My wife ordered the lobster bisque as her entree, which was smooth and creamy with a good lobster flavor.  I suspect we could have asked for bread on the side, but it didnt come with it by default. I ordered the short ribs with roasted asparagus and jalapeno cheddar grits.  The ribs were cooked just right, just a little pink and tender with a concentrated glaze of delicious sauce layered on top.  The sauce had a light smoky flavor with a fair amount of saltiness, and appeared to be a long simmered reduction with bold flavor. As others have mentioned, the jalapeno grits are very good, not spicy by any means but a little crunch from the jalapeno pieces, creamy and well prepared.  I strongly recommend the short ribs to anyone. We splurged with dessert of key lime pie and a banana split.  The split included three large scoops of (what appeared to be) homemade ice cream and topped with caramelized pecans.  The key lime was tart and delicious. The portion sizes were perfect and considering the careful preparation and unique flavors the price was appropriate.  Its a little more expensive that I would like to put Grassroots into our weekly rotation, but I look forward to visiting it again and sample more items off the menu when the budget allows. * I didnt know what burrata was: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrata"
4,"Five Guys is good eats.  Weve been eating at this location frequently (perhaps too frequently!) since it opened. Honestly, I dont think the food here is any fresher than In & Out Burger, but I like the selection of toppings (can you say, ""fresh jalapenos!"") and the great selection of sodas. The peanuts are a nice touch to get you warmed up for the Main Event while you wait. I personally think its a little over-the-top to decorate the place in nothing but rave reviews (WE GET IT ALREADY!!), but the cool music makes up for the lack of ambience. Since the Zagat announcement earlier this week, its been mobbed.  Try to avoid peak hours, unless you want to wait for a table. Five Guys is definitely pricier than In & Out, but I think the selection of ingredients justifies the premium. 3 tips: -Our family of 4 (2 adults, 2 kids under 10) can make do with one order of fries, though the orders have gotten smaller than when they first opened. -Ditto for the burgers.  Dont let the moniker ""Little Cheeseburger"" fool you.  I got the regular burger...once.  But the ""Little"" one is perfectly sufficient for me, especially after I load up on toppings. -Cant decide between the regular fries and the tasty Cajun fries?  Ask for a half-half order and ""POOF!"", youll get it! Enjoy! UPDATE: Gotta drop em to 4 stars.  The last several visits, the fries have been soggy.  Once they were even opaque in the center --- not cooked!  Ask for them EXTRA CRISPY!!"
3,"Not the best burger Ive ever had, but a fun place to try with the coworkers on a Friday afternoon. I had the quadruple bypass and a few helpings from the all-you-can-eat fry station. Better than BK/McDs, but nothing to write home about. The waitresses were hot and they happily wheeled me out to my car in a wheelchair! But its more of an attraction than anything else."
4,"I am just providing a review for the Mother and Infant Care Department only, since my wife has just had our second baby delivered here. We really enjoy our stay at this hospital. The facility is very clean and nice. Room are good size with shower box inside bathroom, so you can take shower during your stay and care for the mom. During the stay, Mom and the caregiver are entitle to have breakfast, lunch, and dinner for free. All you have to do is call and place your orders. The foods are quite quality and the portions are decent. I am really impressed with this. The nurses are all knowledgeable, caring, and nice. They are always there when you call them and need them. Since this is our second child, it works out perfectly that the nurses only come by when we call them or when they do their routine checks. So, the rest of the time you are left alone to rest. The hospital where my first child was born was different. They let lots of interns and students come to our rooms all the times for training, so we were constantly bothered.  However in my opinion, if it is your first child, you may find that having people around all the time could help you not to worry too much (since we all know nothing when the first child come). The reason I didnt give this hospital 5 star is just because our discharge was taking so long. We thought we would be out by 11 AM, but we didnt get out until 3 PM... They said that because it was on Sunday.  I think it make sense. Overall, I do recommend this hospital for any new mother."
5,"BEST PANCAKES!!! We want the recipe. Theyre newly remodeled and better than ever. Always great bagels but now they have added more menu items, more choices. Great food, great people!"
1,OMG! what is the rave about? this place is disgusting! its dirty and the food is not worth it! i came here with my family and we each order a little bit of everything that is suppose to be good and popular there. unfortunately everything is bad. i walked by the waiters and they were all cursing really loud in vietnamese to each other. the table is icky and it smell like my cooked up oil . ick! go to Pho ao sen instead at least its clean.
5,"I dont drink a lot of coffee, but Im a fan of tea. Especially strange tea that I probably cant pronounce right. Oh, and I like it when it smells like scotch. Yep, Im a fan of Lapsang Souchong. But Im not a fan of ""foofy"". And thats one thing that Tea infusion is not. Its not foofy. Its funky. Its fun. And everyone who works there is really friendly. Beyond the teas, the food is good, too. I dont know that Id eat there every night, but its a wider variety than Id expect at a tea place. This is a regular stop of mine. Makes Tempe Markeplace worth it!"
5,"Thats Amore is awesome! Im glad to see that a nice, clean and friendly local place is being supported and recognized. It deserves the five star ratings- the gelato tastes fresh and you really experience all of the flavor. Its a nice place to ride your bike to and get a refreshing treat when it gets hot."
4,"Always good beer and good food. Well let me say the food is not super fantastic but its better than a lot of brewery food out there. Spinach dip is good, nachos are always a staple, burgers could use a re-do. Salads are pretty good, pizza is mediocre. Wings are not half bad!! Sauce is pretty fiery! Nice!! Not a wussy sauce here! But I do love this place and the patio. Beers you cant go wrong with. Very flavorful good beers. All I ask is just a bit more quality in the food. Thats all thats wrong IMO or not really wrong but something they could improve on."
5,"This place was the answer to my German grocery shopping dreams! I thank the Yelp community for leading me to Old Heidelberg. I was picking up a number of items for an Oktoberfest party I was cooking for and hosting at my house, and was able to fulfill most of my exotic German needs at this one stop. I picked up pumpernickel rye bread, authentic concentrated Maggi Würze seasoning (not the soy sauce-tasting stuff you find in most American grocery stores) and Knorr zwiebel-kräuter salat krönung. They also had lots of Knorr sauce mixes that you just cant find over here (for instance,  sauerbraten gravy). I stuck around for a few minutes to talk to the two women who ran the place (Andrea and Chris). I volunteered that I had lived in Germany for years, including Berlin and Bavaria.  They were totally friendly and even suggested some other places nearby that I could check out for German grub or rarer German beer selections. I promised I would be back... especially since I spotted that they had frozen leberknödel (liver dumplings). I made these once from scratch years ago but that was a lot of work. Knowing that they carry such delicacies has snagged me hook, line and sinker, as I am now destined to return and once again indulge my German food fantasies."
3,This place is pretty good. better than average but not great. Fish fry on Fridays is ok if you like DEEP battered fish. nice atmosphere lots of TVs. Uquiel Beer on Tap
1,"We checked out RnR on Sunday (just a few days after opening.) In all fairness, I have to agree with many of the other reviews. Even though they are new, these things are fixable so hopefully the feedback will be taken in the appropriate vein. The building is very cool and the vibe was energetic on a sunny Sunday morning. There was an abundance of waiters but they seemed to be confused and frenetic without a real focus on the customer. The menu is very limited and our server had not eaten most of the items. He was struggling to explain. Our drinks took more than 15 minutes to arrive even though we saw them sitting at the bar for the entire time. Our water had just disappeared. Then the food. I ordered the grill cheese ( a rare treat and when I order it I want it good!). It was cold and overwhelmed by heavy bread. The cheese wasnt melted. I sent it back and they simply nuked it and brought it out. Icky. Our son wanted a kids cheeseburger and the staff kept coming back and forth not sure if there was a single burger or sliders for kids. It became comical after the third person came out. My husband ordered a salmon omelet with several additional fixings. The eggs tasted like box eggs and it was lackluster and flavorless. We even took the time to provide feedback to management but we got a weak smile and ""come back and try us again."" He made no effort to ""make things right"" either by comping something else to taste or providing an incentive to come back. There are too many restaurants in town to have to go to one that is less than mediocre. The young crowd may enjoy it for the bar vibe it gives but the majority of the tables on Sunday am were families or middle aged and we saw similar responses at other tables."
5,"Oh Chipotle, I love you.  Healthy options even when craving Mexican!  My favorite is the chicken burrito bowl with fajita veggies.  Served on a bed of rice with black beans and pico de gallo, with some spicy corn thrown in....ahh my mouth is watering already.  Ive been to many locations, and all are clean, food quality is excellent, service is friendly and professional, and I always leave satisfied.  5 stars to you, my friend."
5,Good micro brew made right there. Food is good as well.
4,"My date and I started in the basement which was super cozy. While waiting, we were distracted by the amazing aroma of food surrounding us from other tables. Once we sat down, we could NOT make a decision about what to order--everything looked so good. Our server was very helpful in aiding us with picking appropriate sized plates (we were starving and nervous we wouldnt have enough haha). We left with a to go box and no room for dessert! Loved it. Cant wait to go back. GREAT date night spot. But we prepared to wait and have a drink, this place is busy for good reason."
4,"The coffee is excellent. The vegan peanut butter cookies are to die for and I generally loath all things vegan. I just tend to believe some things are meant to have milk and eggs in them...oh, and DO NOT get between me and a good steak, you may lose a hand! Anyways, luv all the independent art & designers. Right now I am coveting those adorable litttle robot sculptures. Oh no, I sense another collection/obsession coming on.....do robots get along with owls?"
5,"Why oh why cant there be one of these closer to my house?! I would take them any day over Subway. Their bread is fresh, their meat and cheese is sliced perfectly thin. This may sound strange too, but every Mr. Goodcents Ive been too has the BEST soda fountain Coke. Okay...I said it. Judge me.  I do prefer the Mr. Goodcents over in Tempe off of 48th Street, but this one is just as good."
4,"Nice ambiance, nice authentic spicy chinese food.   As good as you can get here in Arizona;  it aint L.A or San Fran, but does a good job to satisfy the craving for real chinese.   Of all the Cofco asian restaurants, this is one of the more presentable ones to bring business clients or a new date, if ambiance is key to scoring positive brownie points.       For some bizarre reason, on the weekends, it is filled with asian-women/white guy couples,    which strikes me as hilarious.  If it wasnt for this,  I would eat there multiple times a week.  Asian woman orders from real chinese menu;  her white guy orders from chow mein menu.   Side note:  Get a grip; asian women check each other out, and  usually not in a nice way--like in a sizing you up-comparing you to herself way--so I usually end up losing my appetite when I catch one of them staring at me (and my man) and whispering to her white guy or her girlfriends about me;  yah, I understand the shit you say about me, asian girls, because I speak your language too, hello!   So I compensate for my chinese food cravings by quick carry out.  Works like a charm every time.  Im happy, my own Cracker is happy.  Owner gets lots of business and is happy.    We all win."
5,"So my coworkers and I decide we want donuts on a Weds. I know typically donuts are on Fridays but what the hay. In my search for a really good donut I go to the Internet and Google ""best donuts"" and low and behold Bosa Donuts comes up. They have 3 locations, and the one in Chandler has 12 reviews, which all raved about how great Bosa Donuts were. So I notice they have a location at 35th Ave and Glendale! I had seen it many times but never stopped in thinking it was just the average run of the mill donut shop. Boy was I wrong!  Bosa Donuts is by far the best donut I have had in a very long time, maybe ever! I stopped by for a dozen this morning and bought a little something special for myself. I got to the car and took one bite and was in heaven. The what I would call a Cinnamon Fry with crumb topping was to die for. What I liked the most was it was not greasy like some other donut shops. (I wont mention any names, you know who you are!) Lightly crisp on the outside and so tender on the inside. The crumb topping was just the icing on the cake. It was all I could do not stop and get some milk so I could utterly devour the rest of my donut on the way to work. I did have a bite of an Apple Fitter after getting to work and it was very yummy too. They have many varieties and some wonderfully looking croissants too. If you have not tried Bosa Donuts in Phoenix you are missing out!"
5,"I love Tempe Marketplace and frequent it regularly.  It has many dining, shopping, and entertainment options.  It is an outdoor mall and in the summer there are misters and in the winter heat lamps and a large fire pit.  It has stores that are usually only found in malls such as Tillys, American Eagle, and Victorias Secret, but also freestanding stores such as Target, Best Buy, and Ulta.  There are a large variety of restaurants and a Harkins Movie Theater as well.  It is a great place to hang out with friends and see the local night life!"
3,"Sorry, I really just dont get it. I didnt hate it and Im not hating on it now, but I dont see what all the fuss is about. * Pizzas slapped together resulting in uneven, soggy crusts. Our party ordered 5 of the 6 available. * Psychological warfare of having to wait forever for just a few tables maintains an air of pompous superiority that tricks the famished patrons into reporting the pizza is a lot better than it really is. Waiter actually boasted about the 3 to 4 hour Saturday night wait, which we got around by having reservations! * Bottles of iced tea and other drinks bought in bulk rather than any alternative that would make more sense. Good? Not bad... Best in the Phoenix Valley? HIGHLY debatable, but personally I really cant say that I think so... Best is the USA? Impossible, theres just no way. LGO is better. Cibo is better. Spinatos is better. Most hyped? Most definitely."
3,"Bizarre location with good food. Dont expect an ""environment"". Its poorly decorated but looks as if there is a rockin karaoke setup there. Still, I liked it."
4,"You dont come for the run-of-the-mill pizza. Nor do you show up for the cheap pitchers of beer. No, you make it here for the show. A massive organ fills the entire building, incorporating dozens of intruments, and the virtuosos playing it take center stage. Sit back and watch then perform your favorite songs, from Star Wars to The Little Mermaid. Dont let the average food dissuade you from a one-of-a-kind experience."
5,"My son comes here for the tacos but I am all about the chile relleno.  I never had one with potatoes inside, but oh my, this was the best!  My only recommendation would be to order it dry, with the sauce on the side.  I am counting the days until I get back to AZ.  The new location is so much closer to us, I plan on trying all of their menu, but....but... that chile relleno is ....calling....me.......! The tacos were very very good though."
5,"The people at this title company are as good as it gets. They are eager to do a really good job for the agents that use them.  Bill Risser and Paul Guenther are techno pros regarding the Social Media techniques and readily share their expertise and time to teach the skills of Twitter, Facebook, Hootsuite, and  other aspects of Social Media which agents can utilize to serve their clients in a diligent and efficacious manner.  The buyers and sellers of  property will really gain by using them because their handling of the transaction will be efficiently and quickly finished."
4,"They had amazingly quick service during lunch! The servers were VERY polite, almost to the point of being obnoxious. I ordered the daily special--bacon cheeseburger--which came out hot, fresh, and delicious, though the fries were heavily over-salted. Our drinks were also quickly refilled without us asking, which was nice but unfortunately their tea basically tasted like water. Overall, it was a good experience and I would come back again."
4,"Good pizza, nice place & the owner was very accommodating. Im a fan."
5,"Old school style butcher shop that has great service and a great selection.  You will pay more, but you can sign up for their emails and get the monthly and weekend specials.  Often there are coupons for BOGO or a few bucks off your purchase.  They also have a good selection of beer and wine, side dishes, and some supplies for home BBQ and smoking.  After reading the other reviews, I know my hubby and I need to try the jerky.  We always enjoy shopping at Von Hansons."
5,Best donuts I have ever had.
4,"Sorry for my lateness but I wanted to update everyone that after my review I was contacted by management, apologized to, and asked back for another chance. I WILL be back just as soon as it cools down and update my review then. Everyone deserves a second chance to make things right. I appreciate the professionalism and attention to customer service. Im looking forward to it."
2,"Okay...this was very surprising since it was just voted Best Southwestern food in PHX mags Best of the Valley issue...and thus, it made us want to have a visit. I LOVE southwestern food...and I was very let down by this place.  I feel like I should give it 3 stars...but as an ""A-OK"" rating, I just cant.  If 3 stars were for ""OK food"" then Id give it 3 stars.  But truly, I have...I have had better. PHX Mag said to try the crab cakes, which we did, and they were delicious.  Very happy with them and therefore expected the entrees to be just as great...but they werent.  : (  I had the salmon, which the waitress recommended and it was such a bummer.  It had way too many conflicting tastes going on that didnt seem to blend at all.  I lost my appetite after a few bites.  My boyfriend had the shrimp tacos which were just...average.  We were really disappointed.   Again, the crab cake appetizer was great and the two margaritas were as well - the Tontorita and the Prickly Pear - both very, very yummy.   But overall, if PHX Mag continues to recommend more lame-oid meals, Im gonna have to start using it as wrapping paper instead of a go-to guide for great meals in this town."
2,"I was here once. A reasonably sized girl broke her white plastic lawn chair and tumbled to the ground. I averted my gaze and tried to focus on my overpriced mediocre eggs benedict. My friend just laughed and laughed. I guess I should have ordered the mimosas, too."
1,"Should be called The Bad Egg. Bottom line, the hotels free breakfast tasted better than this and we got better service there.  We arrived around 945am on a Sunday morning and had to wait around seven minutes to be seated. The staff was pleasant enough. We were seated, given menus with water and she took our order for coffee and the breakfast special (loaded potato skillet). We sat for 15 minutes before we saw our waitress again. She finally figured out she forgot to bring our coffee. We finally got some coffee which was mediocre in flavor. Our food arrived about ten minutes after that. The skillet was supposed to contain sausage, bacon, onion, scrambled eggs, grilled american potatoes covered with cheese and sour cream. Mine had no bacon, two tiny chunks of sausage, no cheese, and the potatoes were so soggy, they tasted like someone had thawed them and thrown them in as an afterthought. It was so unpalatable i could not eat more than one bite, even after loading it up with salt and hot sauce. The waitress never checked on us once during the meal. She came back by the time my husband was finished. I told her the meal was horrible (in a nice way). She offered me something else. By that point, I was not feeling like eating anything else, I felt kinda sick. My meal was comped and we did get an apology. The manager explained that everyone LOVES that special and the potatoes are seasoned and grilled. The cook obviously didnt try my potatoes. Blech. Even with the comp, the total was over $15 for one special and two coffees. Very hight priced for nasty food, poor service, and loud/uninspiring atmosphere."
5,"One, two Feddys coming for you! ""Three, four better lock your door!"" ""Five, six pick up a crucifix!"" ""Seven, eight better stay up late!"" ""Nine, ten if Freddy Kruger went to Lush hed have had great skin!"" Dude, this place is AMAZING! All of their products are all natural, freshly made without preservatives, and are just incredible.  My best friend and  went here after a four martini lunch plus shopping, and we had a had treatment done with their Ocean Salt Cleaner and exfoliator.  It is made with sea salt and smells just like a margarita!  his was followed by using their dream cream, and now I am hooked!  And its not just the martinis!  I have very sensitive skin, and I have never had a reaction.  They also have a great mens line as well.  I have been using the Ambrosia Shaving Cream for men as well on my face, and I have no razor burn.  It is like a light cream that moisturizes while I shave.  Wow!  I have never felt good after a shave! Anyway, I could gush all day about this place, but the bottom line is it has incredible products that are all natural, and many are vegan,  the staff is amazingly helpful and not at all phony, and even though it may seem expensive the products last for a long time, so the cost is really not that high.  Get thee to Lush!"
4,"Great food, great price, very awesome lunch specials.  I would have given 5 stars but the service is normally a bit fast and some of the wait staff are a bit pushy!!  All in all, great value."
4,"I recently stayed at the Valley Ho for a conference being held on-site. My experience was really nice, everything from the food to the retro style room to the poolside atmosphere.  Cafe ZuZu has an assorted lunch selection and Trader Vic was only a short on-site walk where I enjoyed their happy hour. The front desk, catering and valet staff were helpful and provided outstanding service to all the guests.  When scheduling future company events I will definitely keep the Valley Ho in mind."
4,Very nice place with extremely friendly staff.  The food was similar quality to other Mexican food places in the NW Valley....good but not spectacular.   Very good portions for the price.   I dont live close by but will certainly go back when I am in the area.
4,Dont know why it took me this long to check out Joes Farm Grill but my out-of-towners got a kick of this place. We ordered : Fontina Burger - 4* BBQ Chicken Pizza - 4* Grilled Veggie Pizza - 3* Sweet Potato Fries - 2* Garlic Fries - 4* Onion Rings - 5* Chocolate Milk Shake - 2* The good: - great selection of American food / good portion sizes - allow upgrades to different kinds of fries to your meal - the decor & cute history behind the farm - open kitchen / sauce bar - friendly staff  - outdoor picnic benches under a huge tree where the kiddies can enjoy themselves - hand washing fountain conveniently located by the soda fountain - kiddies love the cool restrooms  The bad:   - lots of flies outside (thats summer in a farm for you) - limited seating inside - real vanilla milkshake tasted weird ( too much lemon juice?)
5,"This place is everything a sports bar should be. Lots and lots of TVs...for one. I love being able to watch 4 different sports and play trivia all at the same time. The drink specials are pretty decent. Theyre not a dollar or anything, but the big beers are cheap on happy hour. The food is great! So far Ive only tried the spinach dip, wings and their all-you-can-eat fish & chips. All of them were seriously delicious! These types of food are pretty standard in sports bars but Ive definitely had my fair share of unfortunate food items from other places. These certainly surpassed my expectations. And last but not least, their star of the show, Debbie. One of the best bartenders Ive ever seen. She runs that bar like a champ, knows nearly every face that walks through that door, and pours great drinks. And by great, I mean a good stiff drink thats not so strong that you cant taste anything else in it. We frequent this place quite often, and for good reason. Do yourself a favor and stop in!"
4,this place will kind of throw you off when you first step with the wall nic nacs and the display that sells body wash and toothpaste next to chop sticks and such but the food is surprisingly delicious.. my husband order the chicken curry friee rice with orange chicken and he loved it. i had the chicken and beef chop suey and was not disappointed. kudos to this joint could do with some spring cleaning and a little sprucing up but good all the same
3,"I really try to like Old Town Scottsdale - and if you look past all the God-Awful tourist traps it is actually quite a nice place with a number of top notch dining options - but in the end you can only walk by so many mass-produced ""native"" jewelry shops with ""Bargains"" before it all starts blending together.  Parking is generally a travesty but can be found if youre willing to wait it out and the public art is a nice touch.  For my dollar - go, grab a spot, and kill some time at Cartel, grab some local foods at Bodega, and maybe consider a bite at one of the locally owned restaurants like FnB or Praying Monk, and skip any place with turquoise jewelry in the window while focusing on the galleries that dont quite seem to fit the theme."
1,"I bought a deal off of Living Social and waited a while to call them, figuring theyd be swamped with business. Now I cant get them to call me back so I can use my deal. (NOTE: There were no reviews of this company on Yelp BEFORE the Living Social deal.) Of course, Living Social is no help - their website says I need to call a consumer advocate in my area. This kind of thing, I predict, will be the demise of every deal-of-the-day site: the company selling the deal bears no risk of having to pay refunds if the business providing the goods or services doesnt perform. I have since cancelled my subscriptions to EVERY deal-of-the-day email out there. Lesson learned about TWO companies with no ethics."
5,"Absolutely LOVE spicy pickle! Sandwiches are great (always make sure to get them HOT!) Pickles are awesome too!  Food is consistent and really good. Good variety, and you can easily make your own sandwich with a ton of choices. Good breads, meats, cheeses, toppings, sauces. Overall a really good sandwich!"
4,"So the other day, I was in the mood for sushi at my usual spot (Sakana).   Unfortunately, they were closed for lunch, so the next choice was some pasta at Caffe Boa next door.  Also closed for lunch.  Double Shit!!   Pasta Pomodoro?  Their tortellini alfredo rocks!!  Then I find out all of their AZ locations closed.  Triple shit!!   Stomach is growling and quickly getting pissed off.  Okay, Haji Baba then.   Bessie gets me there in record time but alas, the place was PACKED, even for a 2pm lunch.  What to do?   Wait...theres that little Vietnamese joint a few doors down, that Ive always wanted to check out but just never did. Well, I guess they say better late than never for a reason.  I popped in, grabbed a seat and was quickly served up one of my favorite Vietnamese dishes.  Deelish is all I can say.  Now Ive got a new little spot to add to my local list of favorites."
3,"Tried this for dinner one night.  Had the hot and sour soup, which was good.  Partner had the won ton soup, but had to ask for crispy won tons to add to the soup.  I had a diet coke to drink, but I swear there was alcohol in the glass - I sent it back and the same happened again.  i tasted my partners and hers was fine - not sure what was going on there. I had kung pao beef - it was a little too crispy.  My partner had the shrimp version (she wanted scallops but they were out !) - she said it was excellent. Liked the decor, but a bit pricey for what you got."
5,"If your day is lacking a good decision, this place will change the course of your life - at least for an hour. I have only ever ordered the Oggie (Im a one pasty kind of guy), but most of my friends have had their way with the rest of the menu and it doesnt disappoint. Easily one of my favorite spots in Tempe.  Its also a much larger version of its former self so you no longer have to gladly wait an hour for a table."
2,"What is the big deal about this place?! Its not great, but pretty good. Not bad, but ok. Just is what it is. We had some wings and a stuffed pizza, and the wings were undersized yet pretty flavorful. The pizza, I just dont understand the hype. Maybe Ive had Giordanos, Ginos, and Lou Malnatis too much in Chicago but this place just wasnt it. The pizza is okay, and just okay... if nothing else, WAY too salty. After a while, I felt like I was consuming a salt lick. Service was weird, and Im pretty sure our server was on coke. the restaurant was PACKED and the place was buzzing and he came and sat at our table and started shooting the shit. It was very bizzare. We got someone elses order of wings, and didnt know they werent ours until the server told us (after we had eaten them all) so we felt kind of bad.  Id go back here again but I wouldnt really be too eager to."
4,"A perfect way to top of an exotic shopping experience at 99 Ranch.  The Taiwan Express has photos of many (not all) of their dishes. Very authentic.   Also try some shaved ice for desert (brought me back to Singapore!).  My kids love the shaved ice, though they are more used to Asian foods than most kids.   Note that the Buffet section (to the left) is better than any mall food courts, and may be more tame for some taste buds.   AND - in between the buffet and Taiwan Express you can buy a whole roast duck for about $12.50, which they will cut up for you.  Be sure to buy some Plum Sauce (elsewhere in the store) for a sweet dipping sauce for the duck (yummy!)."
4,"Yes, Im a fan this place but it definitely does not deserve a 5 star rating.  First off lets start with the decor.  While it was very nice when it first opened its now getting a little raggedy looking and could use some updating.  Food wise this buffet is above average and definitely worth a visit.   If I could give them some advice it would be to get rid of  the HUGE salad buffet section or at least scale it way down and put that money into even more entree selections.  Ive been coming here ever since they opened and hardly ever see anyone eating off the salad section.  So why spend so much money to have such a huge selection???   Put that money into the entree selection and make this place an even better value.  And for Gods sake bring back the Mayonnaise Shrimp !!  You made one of the best versions Ive ever tasted."
3,"Zipps has good bar food, but the service is usually horrible. The waitresses rarely come to your table. BUT, what really rubs me the wrong way is this.... On multiple occasions, when I pay the bill, the waiter doesnt bring me back the correct change. Even if my change is 1 cent, Im entitled to receive my money back.  Im sorry, but not giving me back my  change because you deem it insignificant doesnt float well with me. They do have great food though."
3,"if you want a really filling, delicious ""please-make-my-head-stop-feeling-like-its-about-to-explode"" hangover cure, there guys have got the remedy!  the hangover helper is all of the above and gets even better when you add the hair of the dog bloody mary for an extra $3! (they also have live music on sundays during brunch!) the architecture and windows are stunning in this place - if youve never been in here, its worth checking it out!"
5,"So far, I have been to Lola twice (a Saturday night and Monday morning). Saturday night was very quiet compared to the super busy Monday morning. Free Wi-Fi, coffee, baked goods, and awesome location...you cant beat it. The morning we went, we had a Monterrey Jack scone that was really good. I laughed when I got my latte in a ""So I Married an Axe Murder""-esque cup. We sat along the high tables facing Central Ave and I really enjoyed surfing the internet and looking out towards Central. There are various types of seating as well as some outdoor tables. I really loved this place but worry that it will be one of those places that will be so popular, youll never get to sit there. That is why I stopped going to Lux because it eventually got so crowded all of the time. My favorite part of Lola coffee is being right on Central and watching traffic and the light rail go past. Love it, love it."
4,"Ive been to Padres several times with local friends and have always enjoyed the food and atmosphere.  This time my table mates included my brother and sister-in-law who were visiting from the east coast.  And who do they always count on for recommending awesome places to eat while in town?  Yup...me.  The pressure was on.  From the opening appetizers of guacamole, salsa, chips, and margaritas to our main dishes, the food was great.  The staff was extremely friendly, including our waiter Chico who kept us laughing.  I am normally a Salmon Spinach Enchiladas guy but decided to go out of my comfort zone with the West Coast Burrito.  Strange combination but it really works well together.  And what did my out-of-town guests think about Padres?  Loved it."
4,"I absolutely love the atmosphere and vibe of Switch.  Ive been there 3 times, once for a latenight snack (before they were serving alcohol) and twice for breakfast.  My favorite thing about it is that I feel completely comfortable going by myself with a book and lingering over breakfast and coffee. Service is always very quick and super friendly, and prices are good.  Unfortunately, as much as I love GOING to switch, I have to be honest and say I havent been wowed by the food so far, although I still need to try lunch/dinner.  Foods not bad, not at all, just nothing spectacular. Having said that though, Ill still go back often!"
3,"Pei Wei is always busy, thats gotta mean something right? Wrong. There are restaurants that serve billions yet all they serve is a gross mystery. Pei Wei is no mystery though, the food is cooked in an open air kitchen. Even so, if there were such a thing as Asian fast food, Pei Wei would be cleaner version of it. Most Pei Weis are situated in pompous locations where ever there is an AJ Fine Foods, but atleast they arent located in the ghetto. As far as the food goes, it is about as Americanized as you can get. So if you live in America and have American taste buds, it will appeal to you. Unfortunately if you want authentic Asian food you wont find it at Pei Wei. I dont understand why they even bother to put chopsticks on the table, the rice isnt even sticky enough to pick it up with. They are for decoration. They are part of the fake Asian dining experience. Apparently, Pei Wei serves food ""manadrian style"" from Thailand, Vietnam, Japan, Korea, and China. In the words of Bill Lumbergh, ""Ooo.. yeahh.. Im just not sure about that."" Having traveled to China I can honestly tell you that Chinese food is different. Apart from the rice, the food lacks vegetable oil and garlic. In China those two ingrediants are used in many dishes and Pei Wei lacks them. When I first started visiting Pei Wei I ordered the Sweet and Sour, but I got sick of it. Sometimes the meat would be tough, sometimes the chicken would clump together all nastily. What I get now-a-days and what I got on this particular day was Mandarin Kung Pao. Even though the dish is spicy, that doesnt mean it has to be dry - and it was. What it was missing was some catalyst to bring out the spicy flavors and make them more vibrant. The dishes at Pei Wei are family style meaning they are meant to be shared with several people. A dish and a drink will end up costing you about $10. If each person gets one dish, thats a lot of food, probably enough to feed a small village in Africa somewhere. It would be nice if they served each dish in two styles, family and single, large and small. Family style is great if you always visit Pei Wei with your family. But if you are out for lunch with people from work you might not want to share your food with your co-workers. They arent your family. You dont know them. Pei Wei is a modern Asian diner that is probably better than most of the mom and pop Asian diners out there, even if most of the food is cooked by Mexi-- I mean Asians."
3,Kimchi - 5 stars. Other side dishes - OK. there is no date on it so I really dont know how fresh they are. I went there couple times to get side dishes other than Kimchi. it was not as good as Paldo. I only go to Seoul Market for Kimchi now.
3,"A  bit surprised at the high prices but figured that the ""trendy factor in old town"" and the atmosphere was the reason because the teeny portions of the food and the quality is just GOOD, like the Good egg, not great, not bad, just good.  No happy hour? And Too dark inside.  Lots of pretty wait staff.  My first suggestion would be to fire grill the mahi tacos and not batter them, they were not that flavorful. The side dishes of street corn and some potato chorizo thing were very good. I wanted to try the guac, but 12 bucks for an avacado with some garlic and cilantro? How about trying to make a good ceviche? My hubby and i thought that Rubios rocks in comparison, we love the shrimp tacos and the pablano and portobello tacos."
4,I really enjoy this place and have eaten there several times. They just recently changed their menu but I like the brew additions. The coconut shrimp are awesome and the ahi tuna salad is to for for!  I did have the chimichurri flank steak sliders but they werent good. Our waitress was great and offered me something else.
4,Decent place for pizza.  The only place in the West Valley to get decent Margherita pizza.  Not the best but good enough to satisfy.
5,Ohhh this is the best place ever! Every thing I have ordered has been delish!
5,"great service, great food, and great outdoor seating made for a wonderful first time experience at this charming little restaurant. you would think that sitting outside eating in the middle of august summertime in phoenix would be practically unbearable. local breeze made it tolerable and i dont think my overly-sweaty ass ever felt uncomfortable once during the whole dining experience. they had fans, a swamp cooler, and misters going and it made for a comfortable and charming outdoor dining venture. we started off with the greek lavosh which was to die for. the cheese they melted on top of it will make any cheese lover weak in the knees. their mojiot lemonade was crisp and refreshing. ok selection of beers, certainly not the greatest but i picked out a favorite, kiltlifter, to go with my coca-cola ham sandwich. my girlfirned (Rachel O.) went with the atomic burger as we are both fans of spicy food and this burger comes topped with horseradish. it even made her face scrunch up and me quiver in my seat the moment it hit my tongue and you better believe i enjoyed every second of it. the coca cola ham was HUGE and both of us only managed to eat half of it. leftovers are always good. service was spot on, and i enjoyed the decor and atmosphere despite what many people have complained about before. get over it, its no longer pallete, move on, and enjoy the local breeze."
3,"Bar Smith has potential to be a chic hot spot in the heart of downtown; just a few steps away from the symphony hall, Chase Field, and the US airways Arena. However, this place, despite its pseudo-hipness fails to deliver in the cocktail department, which, with its continuously crappy music, would be the only real reason youd come to this bar. Its really a 2.5 star place-- bartenders are nice,but dont really get the job done. When youre paying over $8/drink, youd at least expect them to do that. The roof is cool though so an extra .5 stars for that."
4,"Alright, well seeing as I work right next door, my mouth has been watering over this place ever since I laid eyes upon the menu. And tonight, we finally had some yummy Rumbi take-out. First things first: theyre a little pricey, at first glance. However, their portions are *enormous*. Each of us ordered a full size bowl(Honey Orange Shrimp for me, Jamaican Jerk Kalua Pork for Jamie, Honey Orange Kalua Pork and Teriyaki Chicken for Jamies parents). The full size bowls were more than enough to last the average person through dinner, and then through lunch the next day; packed full of rice/noodles, meat, and veggies, with each bowl containing a ramekin of sweet teriyaki sauce. The shrimp in my bowl was perfectly tender and succulent, the Honey Orange sauce sweet, but not cloyingly so. The bowl came with a lime wedge, which added the perfect zing to the mellow coconut ""Rumbi rice"". We also ordered some of their Bahama Mamas Tortilla Soup, which was a creamy coconut-based broth filled with chunks of grilled chicken, tortilla strips, and melty mozzarella. It was a good, cozy soup, but could have benefited from more depth--some tang, some spice, something. For dessert, we had some of Rumbis Key lime pie--moist, rich, and delectably sweet with a lovely measure of sour. Only complaint? The graham cracker crust was too mushy, soft, and crumbly; it would have been much better with a crispy bed under the pillowy-ness of the Key lime filling. All in all? Great place with reasonable prices, given their generous portions. They have a TON of salad options, as well, each more inventive than the last, and Ill be returning to try and test each one :)"
5,"Very good place for breakfast & lunch tucked away in the crowded shops at 44th & Camelback.  I kinda found this place on accident.  I meant to just run into AJs and grab a salad to go, but was forced to park basically across the driveway from Taylors, and, being closer, I opted to go there instead.   Taylors is open 6-4ish (I couldnt really tell, they probably just changed the hours and scratched off the hour number on the door), and they serve breakfast all day- well, all day theyre actually open- which is always good with me.   I was in the mood for corned beef, and , bingo, there it was.  Nice mound of lean tasty beef with melty cheese (no saurkraut or thousand island, please.).  And the bread- oh the bread- grilled to be crispy on the edges but still soft inside.  How in the hell do they do it?  I dont know, but Im in love."
4,"All around great.  Great food, great atmosphere and great location if you work in the downtown area."
5,This is a small location but still packed with everything I need.  They did start stalking more womens vitamins I liked without iron because they were always out when I went in.  So I thank them for that! Staff are always nice and for the most part an answer all of my questions.  They take an added effort to get to know their customers.  They always ask about my son when I go in and this keeps me coming back because I feel valued as a person not just a customer.
4,"Pretty yummy! I just went here for lunch and thought the pricing was the best feature. $6.95 for all entrees, which includes a bowl of spicy chicken soup (not sure of name). I ordered the Panang with pork and loved it. It had great flavor and the serving size was appropriate for lunch. Dont let the restaurants outside appearance scare you - the inside is not too bad. The servers were very nice and efficient. Ill be back, guaranteed, because they serve quickly and it works for my lunch hour."
2,"The upstairs theater is nice enough. There are a few nice semi-upscale restaurants here. Its also got a really good swanky (and somewhat hidden) bar here.  So why only 2 stars? Well, because it smells like this is where all the diarrhea in the world goes to die... especially the parking structure. If you can escape the smell though, this is a nice spot for a date. The problem with that is when you go walk her to her car, you have to try and figure out how to have a good night kiss while your nose is telling your brain that you are swimming in a septic tank. The new Waterfront mall corridor stinks like this as well. Maybe thats where the term ""filthy rich"" comes from. What do these people eat?"
4,"Stopped into this good-sized place for lunch today, with Mike C.  Its a little worn, but comfortable, & I counted up 81 regular food items.  All that I tried from the soup, salad, sushi, hot dishes, & dessert selections were good, & I particularly enjoyed these items: *  The Hot & Sour Soup! *  The Kim Chi! *  A tasty salad topping with broccoli, mushrooms, & more! *  The Seafood Salad! *  The Egg Foo Young! A good solid 4-Star place here!  Lunch Buffet $6.99, $6.29 Sr."
4,"At the ripe old age of 3, its time for my previous review to take a siesta. Over the course of that three years, Tempe Cameras only gotten better. The selections improved (finally finding a happy medium between film and digital), the prices are even better than they were, and I dare say service on the retail sides kickass too. TCR is now my go-to photo supplier as a working pro. Theyve either got what I need or can quickly get it, they still know their stuff, and they support both local photographic education and the local photo industry. Theyre also the only dealer in the Valley that sells Think Thank Photo products, which are best damn professional camera bags ever. And if youre an amateur, theyve got plenty of friendly, knowledgeable staff for you too. Dont be afraid to ask for someone else; like almost anywhere, they employ people of varying personalities. There are sales staff I dont click with at TCR, but I wouldnt classify anyone as distinctly rude. (If you want that, youll have to try B&H or Adorama.) If you need lots of hand-holding, the ASU crush probably means youll either want to shop at off hours or go to Photomark--TCR tries, but the crowd to counter ratio just isnt favorable at peak times. Repairs are still something they do very well at excellent prices. When Ive had equipment serviced, its been turned around quickly, relatively inexpensively, and works like brand new. Evaluation of your equipment is still free, as it should ideally be at every repair shop (but often isnt). The labs added a bunch of cool new services, including damn fine plexi mounting, and is doing a considerably better job with film than their old reputation for free scratches with purchase would suggest. Hundreds of frames processed with nary a scratch to be found. Rentals Im a little more ambivalent about.  Theyve thinned the herd out considerably (about half the rentals inventory has taken up residence in the used equipment case) and the selection of lighting equipment is basically unchanged, but theyve got the latest Canon and Nikon bodies, and everythings well-maintained and in good shape. Rates are good for what they do have--the questions just if they have what you want."
2,"Theatre is very nice. Seats are not as comfortable as you would think. They have like office chairs in every other row. Also the food is not good, and its so overpriced. Did you know it costs a dollar to put onions on your burger? Want cheese? Thats another dollar. And its not even good. Screen is beautiful and a clean picture though.. 3D was great."
3,"If you want a dog and are in the area, this is a pretty good call. Having said that, it is probably not worth a special trip. You can find a better hot dog or brat at a ballpark or in the supermarket."
5,"Coffee talk is a nice surprise nestled in the hum drum downtown of Mesa. I have been enjoying their coffee and live talent since I was fifteen. When I was in High School it was a ritual to hit the local dollar movie and then end the night with some coffee at coffee talk. I think the best part was hitting on boys and trying to pass as being at least eighteen years old. My reasons for going to Coffee Talk have changed over the past decade, but the atmosphere and quality drinks and pastries have not changed. There is nothing better than sitting on their back patio and enjoying the cool breeze of the fall. There is something about that place that brings me a sense of relaxation. If you enjoy artistic ambiance, coffee, and live performances then I would recommend Coffee Talk."
4,"If youre a fan of Postino, you have to make your way to Windsor pronto. The central Phoenix restaurant and bar is owned by Postino owner Craig DeMarco (and its right across the street from the central Phoenix Postino), and the atmosphere and vibe are similar to Postinos. Windsor also has an open dining room that extends to the patio, the lighting is also dim, and the servers are also hip. There was a 30-minute wait for my party of two on a recent Friday night, and we sat in the indoor dining area, which overlooked the bar, which was bustling full of people and had standing room only. The restaurant is located in an historic brick building, and it has a cool wall covered completely in cassette tapes that makes it feel even hipper. For food, my pal and I started with the Cheddar Fondue ($11) off the mostly-American menu, which comes with pretzels, apples, pork, bread and sausage. The pretzels were soft and chewy, and the portion was huge. I would have preferred just the pretzels, though the apples and cheese were an interesting combination. Definitely try that appetizer if you go-it was super-tasty. For my meal, I got the Veggie Stack ($9), which was a pita topped with bean spread, quinoa, tomato, cucumber, avocado, radish,  corn and green goddess (I left the pickled beets off). I thought the toppings were interesting both taste- and texture-wise, and that part of the meal seemed relatively healthy. I paired it with some macaroni and cheese, which I enjoyed, though my pal and I werent wowed. Maybe its because the cheese wasnt plentiful or creamy enough, but it was still good. My pal had the Porkwich sandwich ($12). He said he liked it a lot."
4,I finally tired another dish. The Panag Curry with tofu. It was great too. Rich thick curry crisp veggies and tons of flavor. One thing I am upset with its the new $1 fee to use a credit card for bills that are less than $10. So get a drink or bring cash...
4,"Fresh & Easy is the US subsidiary of UK based grocer Tesco who entered the American market in 2007.  I know Tesco really well and they are smart business folks who know their market.  Fresh & Easy has been opening stores all over the Phoenix area and have been using $20 and $10 coupons to build market share.  I give them a lot of credit for doing this. I also have been shopping here for a long time and appreciate their eye on packaging food items for the busy consumer.  One of my favorites is their rosemary focaccia bread dough.  Ive made it at home, but Fresh & Easy make it ohhh so easy when Im tired and its 6:45. BTW, thanks for the Hybrid parking space!"
2,"No way am I coming back here! The shoes seem to be made poorly, but I havent actually kept a pair of shoes and I never will because Im never coming back. I bought one pair because I thought they were cute, but quickly changed my mind so I returned them. Do you know how many people asked my WHY Im returning them? In a very rude manner, literally all the people who were working there. Not only did it make me uncomfortable but they lost a customer because of it as well."
4,"Ive been here so many times, I cant believe I havent reviewed Black Bear yet! This is me and my friends ""go-to"" breakfast place. Ginormous portions, and for a decent price. A little slow on the service, but if youre not in a hurry its no big deal. Basically down home cooking. You see diner and that is exactly what you get. Good eats!"
5,"This place never ceases to amaze. One of the best breakfast places in Phoenix. The Sicilian scramble is a favorite--though the smashed meatball was great. We finally went back for dinner the other night and for the first time I had a burger. It should not be surprising that is was fantastic. Atmosphere is great, service is great, and the food is great--just go!"
3,"Shaved noodles, shaved noodles, shaved noodles!  Am I too butt lazy if I only go for shaved noodles?  The dish ordered with the handpulled meant I had to hold chopsticks high into the air trying to separate a portion of noodles out onto our plates.  Not bad but wasnt special... but the shaved noodles, loved the chewy texture.  I unashamedly used my baby godson as an excuse to get a mini noodle pulling show at the window. Im going to work my way thru the fresh fruit juice offerings...  I used to drink that daily while working as an expat in HK.  Speaking of which, the bathrooms are sooooo HK grand (Amy L, you and I think alike!)... Overall the stir fried dishes were a bit greasy and the flavors decent, but the draw here is the shaved noodles (can I plug this anymore?!) and the fresh fruit juice."
4,"Valle is all about the ritas happy hour, chips and bean dip and an awesome patio, if you are looking to eat awesome pollo funditos well they have that too..."
5,"Great facial great customer service One Love Boutique Spa consists of the waiting room/reception area and the services room.  Its small, cozy but super cute and inviting. I love the way its decorated which is what drew me to buy a Groupon for a signature facial after looking at the website. The decor is white, clean, girly and classic. I was disappointed at first when my initial appointment was cancelled two hours before I was scheduled due to Amanda coming down with something that was contagious, I guess I was thankful too. When I came in for my facial I explained that I was one of the appointments that was rescheduled due to her illness and she upgraded me to the anti aging facial for free!  She also includes eyebrow waxing with every facial which is awesome! The facial was AMAZING and Amanda is very knowledgeable about what she is doing and the products she is using.  Before my facial started I had asked her to mess up my hair as little as possible since I was going somewhere right after, she kindly obliged  and when I left my hair looked exactly how it looked when I came in. Amanda is great and I will definitely be back!"
5,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE Paws Salon. I used to take my dog to Canine Preferred but the ladies at the front dest were flakey, so I thought Id try a new place and I am SO glad I did. The owner Tracy clearly has a passion for animals. Walking in you are greeted by a cat, dog, and Macaw that call the front of the shop home. You are able to see them grooming the dogs (a big plus for me, you never know what some places do behind closed doors). She is very professional and seems like a no bullshit kind of lady (in a good way). Shes to the point, tries to listen to exactly what you want and offers options and suggestions to help. They keep track of the previous cut that was given (its annoying some places you to have to tell them every time). I would highly recommend this pet salon. They also offer daycare, and overnight boarding. I cant want to try the daycare to socialize my pup some more! Cant go wrong at this salon.."
5,"I just stopped in tonight after the gym, I was a bit stinky and what better way to fix that than 16 bars of soap. It was late 8:15 when I walked in :15 before close. This is a great time to shop when you are in a rush. It was empty, and the lines were short. Despite benign the end of a long day the low turnover staff was great and personally recognized me and greeted me."
5,"As far as fast Japanese food at lunch this is as good as it gets.  They have a different Bento Box lunch special everyday.  The box comes with plenty to eat, including Miso Soup which arrives shortly after ordering.  The meal includes sushi, salad, rice, chicken (teriyaki or such), gyoza, some type of fried fish and an orange.  For about $8-$10 its hard to find a better deal.  I would highly recommend CherryBlossom for those looking for a Japanese meal.  It is small, quiet and a little hard to see from the street, which makes it a unique place with low traffic, but high quality."
3,"I tried a few different kinds of pizza and they were all okay.  A few people had told me that they made ""incredible"" pizzas, but I didnt really think so...Id say they were pretty good pizzas.  What I liked were the fresh tasting vegetables which topped some of the pizzas.  The cheese was a bit disappointing, especially since I dont think you can really go wrong with cheese...it just lacked flavor. All in all, I probably wouldnt go back...it just really wasnt all that impressive."
4,"In n Out, I dont know how to tell you this, but . . . Ive found someone else.  No, no, its not like that, it was nothing you did!  Your burgers with their fresh toppings are delicious... but sometimes I just need a little change of pace, maybe something with grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, and bacon... mmm... bacon.  Oh, sorry.  You want to know the name?  I dont see why that...  You insist?  Okay... its Five Guys. Oh!  Youre upset!  YOURE upset!  Well let me tell you what - Five Guys fries are delicious, whether they come in Cajun OR regular!  And I NEVER liked your fries, In n Out!  I just pretended to like them, but theyre skinny, kind of limp, never flavorful, and you dont get very many.  Five Guys cuts em thick, salts them up, and pours an extra scoop into the bag, how do you like that!  And they give you FREE peanuts to munch on while you wait.  You never give me anything! What?  No... youre right, Five Guys is a more expensive taste.  Thats true, it is over $10 for a burger, fries, and drink, as opposed to your $5.  And I do have to park in a garage that loosely resembles a labyrinth designed by Escher.  But if you eventually make it up to the restaurant, they VALIDATE.  You have NEVER validated me!  Oh, thats right, you have surface parking, but dont try to pretend thats a feature with the temperature hitting 100!  Youre ridiculous. Whats that?  Does Five Guys have milkshakes?  Uh... hm.  Milkshakes.  I never thought about that.  They dont.  Would you mind if I got my burger and fries from there and then came to you for the shake?  No?  Fine.  Youre so overprotective and hyper-traditional sometimes.  Live a little. I hope we can still be friends, In n Out, but I just think I need to see other burgers.  Please dont pelt me with limp fries when I turn my back."
3,"We (my husband, 2 friends and I) visited Tavola last night because of a Yelp review. We werent as enthusiastic. The service was great! We ordered 2 pizzas and 2 salads. The salads were fresh, that was a nice surprise, not bagged. The pizza was good. Crust was a thicker than we like. Not a bad experience at all just not quite what we expected after the 5 stars."
2,"This place used to be quite good but I think they may have had an ownership change recently.  Over the past 12 months or so we have seen the quality of the food and service level both drop to unacceptable levels. The food is overall average - the fajitas down right poor and the drinks very inconsistent.  They do get somewhat busy with a bar crowd but that too seems inconsistent so when they do get busy the service gets very bad. When service deteriorates the Manager (or owner, Im not sure) seems to hide from customers.  Overall, make the trip down to Shea Blvd and find much better at better prices."
2,"Being a Phoenix native, I almost felt embarassed that I only ate at Petes for the first time seven years ago.  I had gotten back from England and was trying to recreate the orgasmic fish and chips experience I had there. Petes was around the corner from my complex and after all, I DID see so many  of those ""Im Addicted to Petes Fish & Chips"" bumper stickers all around Tempe. I had to try it. I ordered the two fish combo, and my reaction was...what the..?..are they serious?  1.) The ""chips"" suuuuck. No salt, overcooked and stiff. I couldnt even eat them.  2) The two squares of fish I got were alright, but I may as well have gone to Safeway and bought a box of Gortons fish sticks.  3.) The red ""special sauce"".  Wtf? And you have to pay extra if you want tarter? Lame.  4.) No malt vinegar. Enough said.  Why there is such a collective hard-on for this place is beyond me. Its a laughably bad example of Fish and Chips."
3,"I have been to this place twice and I have had both extremes.   The Good: Shannon, California Sea Bass, Michelle (Managers) Customer Service The Bad: Fried Calamari, Our last waiters breath The first visit to this establishment was our encounter with Shannon.  Shannon was a pure delight as our waitress.  She made our first visit absolutely fun.  My wife had a tilapia dish that she was less than enamored with but I had the California Sea Bass and that tasted very good.  In fact, it was so good that I regretted not getting a glass of Chardonnay to go with it.  The fish had a very nice texture and taste. Our second visit was our first encounter with the fried calamari.  As our guest so eloquently said, ""If this was my first impression of fried calamari, I would not have liked it.""  The calamari was overcooked and there was so much oil running on the plate.  We called this issue to Michelles attention and she agreed 100% that the dish was not prepared properly.  She gave us a coupon to come back there and eat at any time.   However, our waiters breath was another story. Whenever he spoke, I could smell his pungent (trust me, a lot better than what I really wanted to say) breath to the point I almost donned a gas mask.  There are very few things that would cause me to lose my appetite.  His malodorous breath and the calamari with more grease than a Jiffy Lube accomplished the feat."
5,"I will continue to give this place five stars for so many reasons.  First, the menu is very creative, and offers a great variety of healthy food, with an Asian twist.  This time I had the shrimp curry, which had lots of fresh vegetables, and instead of a heavy cream curry, it was a much healthier broth curry.  We had the edamame dumplings again, which were as good as I remembered.  It was kind of cool to see Dr. Weil eating there last night.  Its good to know that he likes the place enough to dine there."
3,Its Pei Wei. The service and food are always satisfactory.
5,"Im not normally one to jump at reviewing a chain restaurant, especially when there are 3 subways all within a couple blocks of each other.  I felt it was necessary in this case.  My husband and I came here over the weekend after a lovely trip to the dog park.  The two guys working here on the lonely afternoon were awesome.  They were really nice and friendly, and quite chatty.  One of them started helping my husband and the other one was sweeping while I was deciding.  The sweeping boy apparently noticed I was ready and he quickly ran to the back, washed his hands, threw on gloves and asked me what I wanted.  WOW!  This type of service has never happened at the other locations, all of which I have been too.  He chatted with me as I told him what I wanted.  He also joked about my weird sandwich and made me laugh.  Its refreshing to see a couple guys working on a boring day and actually enjoying themselves.  They also have outdoor seating which are perfect to sit at and people watch on beautiful days.  We even met this incredible 90 year old guy who is blind and deaf in both ears but somehow managed to communicate with us perfectly.  He was much more lively than most twenty-somethings you meet.  Amazing.  Only in downtown do you meet people like that.  This is a great Subway.  Go here and skip the others."
5,"I just went here for the first time a week ago (visiting my parents who just moved to FH). A++ Great location, view of the fountain, outside seating, nice decor inside, really wonderful owner and a big menu of pastries, croissant, sandwiches, Italian sodas, and coffee. I had the egg salad sandwich (the croissant and egg salad was SO FRESH!!) with a side of potato salad was probably one of the top 3 potato salads Ive ever had! I also got an iced mocha which was just the way I like it, on the sweet side. I had my 14 month old daughter with me so I also shared the potato salad with her and ordered a yogurt with granola.  This was no ordinary McDonalds yogurt parfait - it was so delicious I had to have some too! One gripe (that could be easily fixed by the owner) - PLEASE BUY ONE HIGHCHAIR for your guests to use.  We would love to come back often (as we go see grandma/grandpa) but I cant take another lunch with her on my lap:)"
1,"Let me preface this review ..I have lived in this area for 15 years and Chompies has been the only option for good Jewish deli. In my 51 years I have never received worse service than from Chompies They ALWAYS get the order wrong., Tonight after much debate I caved for my daughter who has strep throat. She wanted nothing else but matzah ball soup to make her feel better. So reluctantly I called in for take out at Chompies. I assumed the one thing on there menu that might be a safe bet and hard to screw up would be the soup. I returned home and called my daughter in to tell her I got what the doctor ordered. As I watched her pour it in the bowl we noticed it was missing one key ingredient......... THE SOUP!!!!!  When I decided to call and tell Chompies this has to be the 10th or 12 time in a row they have screwed up our order. This was more than screwing up a order. This was forgetting the soup in SOUP. They told me if I wanted the broth I should have asked for it in a separate container. I responded I didnt think I had to ask for broth in soup! I WILL NEVER GIVE THEM A DIME OF MY MONEY AGAIN.  I highly recommend to drive the additional 15-20 minutes in your car and find somewhere else when looking for jewish comfort food. You will be highly disappointed with Chompies. This is the first time I have ever heard of yelp. My son told me to come on here because this is a way to tell other people to avoid restaurants such as these. I hope you take my advice."
2,"Oy ve iz mir! Not to be a kvetch....but I consider myself to be an expert on Jewish delis.  As a New Yorker from a predominantly Jewish area and married to a Jew, Ive had more than my fair share of experiences at them.  My husband and I woke up this morning with a burning desire for a good bagel, corned beef on rye, and a knish.  So I schlepped all the way up to the PV Mall to get it. Ok, first of all, the decor is terribly schlocky.  Its kind of like the tourist trap Jewish deli you find in Times Square.  Its like a Disney version of a NY deli.   I take my number and head over to the cold case to get some drinks....of course they didnt have regular lemon Snapple (and why should they?  Its not like every deli, pizza place, and convenience store in NY carries it....) but they did have Dr. Browns Cel-Ray which is always a welcome sight.  Another thing they had in the cold case which I found to be odd were jars of Nathans pickles.  Nathans, like the hot dog place.  I would imagine a Jewish deli would have Ba Tampte pickles....I didnt even know Nathans made pickles!  It was a little lame to be honest. Anyways, I go up to the counter where there doesnt seem to be anyone working.  There was no organization to it.  So I waited.  And waited.  In New York, the deli is a finely tuned machine designed to move people quickly.  Chompies? Eh, not so much.  When I finally did place my order, the guy who took it had a hard time punching it into the computer and asked me to repeat it several times.  Despite saying I wanted my bagel toasted several times I was given a cold, untoasted bagel.  I waited a little longer for my order to come up and went on my merry way.   Here is the breakdown of the food we ordered- Matzoh ball soup- Surprisingly good.  I have never had matzoh ball soup with carrots and celery...so much chazerei!  Just give me the matzoh ball! Although, I will admit, it was solid.  I wouldnt go all the way to Chompies for it because I know that I can make it better in my own kitchen.  Plain bagel ""toasted"" with cream cheese- Terrible.  The bottom of the bagel was entirely too thick and was very hard.  They didnt even cut it all the way through, probably because the crust is too thick!  Corned beef on rye- Meh.  The corned beef wasnt very good, it wasnt corned enough.  If they make their own they didnt use a piece of brisket that was fatty enough.  The rye (which was not marble rye...) was lackluster.   It couldnt handle the corned beef, became soggy, and eventually fell apart.  The pickle it came with was the grossest thing Ive ever seen.  And it was definitely a kosher dill, even though I asked for a half sour.  The potato salad was actually really good though. Knish- Terrible.  The knishes in my elementary school cafeteria were better than this.  First of all, the outer crust was way too flimsy.  It should have been much, much, thicker, especially considering the gargantuan size of the knish.  We essentially ate a large plate of mashed potatoes.  The potato inside itself was unremarkable.  Not only do I have this Jewish thing going on but Im also Irish....Ive never met a potato dish I didnt like.  Until today.  I didnt even finish my half of the knish.  Now for the prices.  Whats with this meshugas?  $2.29 for a bagel with cream cheese is a tad much.  In NY they run you about $1.35.  The corned beef sandwich was $12.50!  Now, Ive paid that much for sandwiches in NY before but you get 2 lbs of meat and several layers of sandwich!  This was not a $12.50 sandwich.  I was also going to get us some whitefish salad to sample but at $15.99/lbs it wasnt happening.   Why anyone should schlep all this way, in this heat, schvitzing all over, for this dreck?  I dont know!"
4,"Great place, great food, great environment ."
5,Excellent
4,This hole in the wall quite possible has the best Chinese food in Phoenix. Deffinitely the best Wor Won Ton soup and pork Egg Foo Young. Great for carry out and they have a large delivery area!
5,"Place is awsome.  Got the beef cheesesteak and everything was great.  The bread was possibly the best I have ever had.  Price was pretty good.  Just over 9 bucks for a whole sammich and soda.  While waiting I walked around and I plan on going back for some shopping.  Lots of pasta, sauces and just about anything you could want for Italian food.  5 stars all the way."
5,"Updating my review after several weeks. Appears maybe the managers read these reviews. In the last few weeks this store has improved 2 stars. The eggs in my BBs have been cooked perfectly, Diet Coke tastes better and they have not forgotten anything in all my visits. Added two stars because they have been consistently 5 stars since my last review...but I am still watching."
4,"I needed to grab a bite on a day in the office, so I thought Id take a little trek over to Sandwich Club. Lots of my former co-workers would tell me that they loved the food here. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by the owner. A super cool dude. He promptly asked if it was my first time there, and he asked where I was from. I like a little small talk before a sandwich. In any case, I ended up going with a no-mayo tuna salad sandwich. Do you remember that time in junior high when you saw a pretty girl and you never had the guts to go talk to her? But your friends dared you to do it? The no-mayo tuna salad is the pretty girl. I dare you to try it. Its amazing. The capers and lemon juice make this so flavorful. Youll be holding hands with this, and it will grace your lips in no time....unlike that girl from Jr. High who secretly despised you because you were fat. Oh wait. The menu seems quite diverse, with many sandwich options, and they also make crepes. The food tasted great, the service was great. Id definitely come back for more and try something else. Afterall....who doesnt love a good sandwich!"
5,"I walked here in the heat and was immediately greeted with an ice cold beer. For free! It was a delicious IPA and the staff couldnt have been friendlier. There were even snacks. I also had another sample of their Camelback ale. Both were heaping samples, almost a full cup. The tour was fun and informative. The co owner George even gave me and my boyfriend a ride to the lightrail stop!! We didnt bring our bikes. So awesome.  Definitely recommend. Lovely way to spend a Saturday afternoon."
4,"I have a cooking problem- I cant do it. However, I loved coming to Entrees to Go to make our meals. My husband bought a Groupon for this place and we decided to try it out. It was a wonderful experience, and that means a lot coming from me since I am not a fan of cooking.  I love the concept of Entrees to Go. You prepare your meal at this place and bring them home in a baggie.  Meals ready to cook and no mess in my kitchen = awesomeness! Everything you need to know to prepare your food is explained and if you have any questions they are answered immediately.  The only downfall...The price w/o a Groupon is a little pricey. Three full size entrees (each entree serving 4-6) is regularly $80. Its great if you work full-time and dont have time to cook on your own but its a little high for my pocketbook. However, if money wasnt a factor I would cook every meal at Entrees to Go.  Loved it!"
4,"I came to this place for my birthday celebration with my fiance and another couple. I was definitely in a good mood. THE FOOD First, the salad bar. I am not much of a veggie lover, but the selection here is impressive, especially in light of this being a place where you eat the cow, not the cows food. Besides a variety of veggies and dressings, you have a few cold cut meats, cheeses and smoked salmon to select from. From personal experience, tomatoes are good, all cheeses and meats are too. Salmon was simply delicious. For the main course, its all sorts of meat, mostly varieties of beef plus lamb and chicken. I liked all of them, but most of the beef was a salty to my taste (hence the loss of a star). Some of it can be explained by my getting the first cut off the meat several times, which meant that I got the salt seasoning in addition to the salt in the meat.  That aside, the meat is high quality and the main objective here is to remember not to get too much too soon, so you can enjoy everything the place has to offer. Sides were small (as they should be) and included polenta, mashed potatoes and fried bananas. All good. The wine selection is extensive and from our limited tasting, quite good. We had Cabernet and malbec. SETTING This is a rather large stand alone restaurant, but has surprisingly personal feeling, especially if you consider the amount of staff running around. It is not too brightly lit and has generally darker tones to the interior. There is also a cozy bar to the side of the main entrance that is a pleasant place to wait for others to arrive. SERVICE Attentive and not at all pushy. OVERALL I came here in a good mood and left in an even better mood and feeling like a python after eating a cow. Which was close enough to true amount of food in me. Highly recommend this both for the experience and the food itself."
2,"I went to NOCA about a month after is opened and was wowed. I told all my fellow foodies about my wonderful experience, the innovative menu and all the little extras that made the meal a really special dining experience in Phoenix.  I went back with friends twice after in the coming months and was pleased each time.  I just went back this past Saturday though, and would have to say I would no longer suggest it for a special night out. It was as if the magic was gone and that the place was showing its age and loosing its ""specialness"". It was really just ok. The chefs talent shows, but too many other let downs.  When we arrived for our 8:30 reservation the place was crowded. The host was friendly and told us that our table would be ready soon and it was. We sat down at our table and thats when things started turning out not as well as expected. Seated in a back corner--which I did not mind---I noticed the walls were filthy---scratched and beat up and dirty. That was my view, so of course its all I could focus on. The waiter did not show up for 5 min. to take our drink order, and when he did it took 20 min. to get them to us. He apologized, but at 8:45 on a Saturday night that waiting for a first drink is not fun.  When then settled down with our menus and picked our choices. It was then we were told that they were out of the veal --which of course 2 of us had chosen by then, and that there was only one Skate dish--which of course the other 2 of us had decided on. They were also out of 3 other items. I felt I was back in the old Eleve (located in this same spot)--the food was great there as well---when they did not run out of many items on the menu. They may be ok when you have a larger menu, but with a small menu to begin with this is a real disappointment.  Gone were the pop rocks that I thought was so fun as an intermezzo, instead a spoon of something that was not described was set down in front of us. A simple salad--good--was $15---and most starters are at least that much. Good, but not worth the price. Otherwise, entrees were good--not special, but tasty and served with good presentation. The cotton candy is still there--and still an attention getter. And I still love the desert selections---especially the malt that I had with mini doughnuts in with dipping sauces.  I think I am able to overlook the fact that its really not an attractive room--the energy from the kitchen and the close tables add noise and excitement to the room, but the art and lighting is ugly and now that its starting to look run down as well--there are too many new, beautiful places in the city with equally good food and equally as pricey that are not in strip mall. And they usually still have most menu selections on a Saturday night."
4,"Since this is a Kimpton Hotel my standards are fairly high.  The reception area and pool are very well done, in typical Kimpton fashion. The rooms are nice, however could use more work. The bathrooms are completely remodeled, but the little amenities that Im use to like the Ipod docking station, flat screen tv, cordless phone, room service past 11pm and multiple outlets (im an electronics junkie) just arent there. The room really feels like any other average hotel.  The spa was lovely, but it is not a full spa. I was hoping to sit in the steam room before my 90min massage, but unfortunately there wasnt one to sit in. The massage room was nice and the largest I had ever been in. It had its own private bath/changing room and a large copper tub close to the actual massage table. I was pretty bummed I didnt add a bath to my massage.  All in all I would stay here again since its in a great location. Plus, the guys at the bell desk will give you a ride (within 3 miles) in a Cadillac Escalade free of charge. That was a great when it came time to partying at night!"
4,"Well, i was very excited to go to this event, however, not so excited when it was all over. The music was great and it is a very nice place. It really reminds me of Vegas. However, it  was fashion week and we all thought that we would see models sashaying down the runway. But, no. No fashion at all. The wine was comp and it was very good ,i give great praise for that!  But the samples of food were few and far between. The Servers skipped out many times. Not like most Yelp events which are usually out the door GREAT!  We ordered from the happy hour menu.  I fully agree lots of salt, but i think it was the soy sauce, it was the most salty..i have ever had. There is very little parking here as well so be prepared for that as well.  All in all we had a good time.But, not as fabulous as most Yelp events."
5,"Totally worth the drive from Scottsdale. The food is delicious, and is not pre-packaged, such a nice change for a coffee joint. Support local business, Starbucks has nothing on Lux; other than a million locations."
2,"I judge a soul food place by its fried chicken, a donut shop by its old fashioned, an ice cream place by its vanilla, and a Greek place by its gyros.  The gyros here are bland and wholly unspectacular - and sourced from the same frozen food purveyor (Sysco?) as every other gyro stop in Phoenix.  The cloyingly thick pita didnt help either. I dont know why it is so challenging to find a legitimate rotating spit gyro in this town - but it is.  Especially near downtown Phoenix. Recommendations welcome."
1,"OVERPRICED & DECEITFUL & RUDE! I should have read the reviews before I came here! I took a bridesmaid dress in to have the top taken in like 1/4 inch, not much. I asked her, how much will this cost? She assured me it would not be ""much"". It was $60 and she hardly did a thing, cant even steam it there. I was irate but calmly asked her if she could charge less and she screamed NO! She said its because the dress cost more. Yeah...like that matters A guy was there dropping off pants that needed taken OUT which is a lot more work, she charge him $18.50 for each pair. I dont know if that is good for pants a lot but her pricing scale seems way off! Previously Ive been to 5th Avenue Alterations and they charge me $50 for a floor length brdiesmaid dress that they took in the whole thing AND steamed it. Theyre also polite and will work with you on pricing and communicate with you beforehand. Definitely worth the few extra minutes of a drive!!"
5,"SAKE    *Japanese alcoholic beverage made from fermented rice; usually served hot . ( Full disclosure : I dont like sake) Parents in Scottsdale for a first look at the new house / neighborhood. We were on the horns of a dilemma : ? Would a mid week , early season dinner at the club be too quiet? Should we  descend south of  the Frank Loyd Wright  into south - north Scottsdale....?? We opted for the safe bet - booked a car and headed south to the Ocean Club. ** A) never drink and drive in Scottsdale ( or anywhere else for that matter) **B) if youre a foreigner - never- ever drink and drive in Scottsdale **C) A + B refer to you Nikolai Khabibulin  (( A nod of support to the YELP community . After perusing the Ocean Club reviews retrospectively I believe the correlation existing between the posted notes and reality to be around 0.90 Well Done!! ( I would go as high as a correlation of 0.95 if high and low marks were thrown out ( similar to olympic skating or gymnastics))) We arrived at the club---- a good bar crowd ( not quite as Mountain lioness(y) as i had expected (? hoped?) -- ? mid week perhaps...?, a good blend of hipsters , hobos and Mrs Lovey Howell IIIs  ( score +1 for the Ocean Club) We were promptly seated - at a good table - well positioned , near the back and partially curtained - nice. ( score + 1 for the Ocean Club) The waiter then promptly arrived to take our drink orders: Now - I dont like Sake ( see note above) - but on occasion - I like to fancy myself as the kind of guy who may indeed like Sake- hence , I order a Grey Goose Sake Martini - "" I have no Sake"" the waiter announces sadly. Now - this is tricky - can I in good conscience penalize the establishment for not having a beverage that I really dont like or want in the first place? Too bad for you Ocean Club cause yes I can. ( score -1 for the Ocean Club) The drinks arrive - I have opted for Grey Goose sans Sake and yes -sweet Jesus  they are huge ( see prior posts). ( score + 1 for the Ocean Club) The waiter then arrives to review the menu and describe the specials- This he does without note , blackboard , evening card or inked cheat note on his wrist- He recites for what seems to be forever... It is like a reading from the old testament - but instead of a mere chapter of the book of Leviticus - he recites the entire book.... I am captivated ....( or is it the Grey Goose) ?? does he really know the name of the Italian girl who dug this evenings truffles up in Piedmont...?? ?? does he really know the glove size of the Japanese ranch worker who massaged the Wagyu beef and from which prefecture he hailed...?? ( if so - why didnt he have him send me some Sake....??) at any rate - I am entertained ( score + 1 for the Ocean Club) The food arrives - the portions are huge and the flavors sublime.

4,"My hubby and I have been fans of Roys since our first time at the flagship location on Oahu . . . and weve watched him expand to the mainland. Our experience with the mainland Roys have been hit and miss, but the Marriott Desert Ridge location pretty much knocks it out of the park! We went at the tail end of Arizona Restaurant Week. We really liked the menu options for this special week, and the warm chocolate souffle cake is always out of this world . . . If that was the only thing that tasted good, then we would feel we got our moneys worth . . . but we didnt have to worry about it because everything was perfect from beginning to end. We had an adorable server who had a great personality and excellent people skills. She was unassuming and let us linger between courses. As I am a stickler about food coming out too soon after just finishing one course, this was just perfect! And so relaxing. The ambiance on the patio, which is where we chose to sit, almost felt as if we were on one of the islands, not in the middle of the desert . . . with the tiki torches lit and the sound of the babbling water features throughout the resort, it came pretty close . . . it was just missing the trade winds.  The resort had a band playing as well . . . they were pretty good, a few ups and downs. I would have loved if the music was a little more subtle than the pop-jazz mix they were playing . . . oh, but I have digressed.  My hubby and his daughter chose the restaurant week menu. Hubby had the Grilled Szechuan Spiced Pork Ribs Smoked & Glazed in Roys Original Mongolian Sauce. A bit cliche, but they were finger lickin good! My step-daughter and I shared the Crispy Spicy Ahi Sushi Roll with Ginger Wasabi Beurre Blanc -- it was huge and almost a meal. The rolls were fresh, crunchy, and had a little kick . . . not too spicy. It was a good thing I agreed to help her with it! For entrees, my hubby had the Roys Original Hawaiian Blackened Island Ahi with Spicy Soy Mustard Butter Sauce. It, too, was an ample portion of tender ahi that was complimented by the sauce but no overpowered by it. My step-daughter had the Roys Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi with Maine Lobster Essence. Another nice portion of perfectly cooked Mahi.  We all were starting to feel the aloha spirit . . . I had to be the exception by ordering off the regular menu and chose my most favorite entree of all . . . the Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish . . . Aah, what a delight, so melt-in-your-mouth delicate . . . I was in island heaven. Desserts were total home runs -- the melting hot chocolate souffle is mandatory for any chocolate lover. In fact, it tastes the same at every Roys weve been to . . . it never disappoints. A total surprise . . . and a delightful one . . . was the chocolate coconut cheesecake which came with a side of mango sorbet . . . or did she say it was pineapple sorbet . . . whatever . . . it was the perfect accompaniment to the light and fluffy cheesecake. We also ordered a bottle of Newton claret which was a modestly priced wine and as my husband said as he swirled and sipped it . . . ""I know my wines . . . "" Having to always be the exception, I ordered the he Original Hawaiian Martini, which was what I considered my dessert. It was a juicy combination of Maui pineapple, vodka and coconut rumMMMMM! It was truly a beautiful evening from start to finish. You may be asking why I didnt give it five stars then if there were no misfires . . . that five star is reserved for Roys Hawaiian restaurants that really do create the aloha experience with some special touches only that can only be enjoyed there!"
4,Just happened to be in the neighborhood when we saw this BBQ place.  The pulled pork and beef did not disappoint.  The sandwiches can be called hardy portions on large buns.  The sauce was excellent.  The place is very clean.  Very good service.  Was not impressed with the coleslaw - seemed flat.  Will return as the high ratings of this establishment are well deserved.
5,"Hands down, best slices in Scottsdale...."
2,"Ive been here twice...the first time was driven by a rumor that they made their own root beer.  Im a sucker for homemade root beer, so I had high hopes that this place would become a favorite.  My husband and I were so excited when these huge glasses of RB hit the table!!  And then confusion...both of us looked at each other and said ""WTF???""  Worst RB EVER! What the heck was in this drink that made it taste like ass?  We looked all over the menu and found nothing.  Then we saw the ""fine print"" on a small table sign...STEVIA.  Its made with Stevia NOT sugar...Im sorry, but I have to say that this is the lame-est root beer on the planet.  If Im going to treat myself to a big glass of homemade root beer, I want it to be delectable...sugar and all...no freaking high fructose corn syrup and no bloody artificial sugars (and yes, I know stevia is ""natural"" but who gives a crap...it tastes terrible anyway). After the root beer debacle, it didnt get better.  The food was meh...service was not so great (there were moments of ""is she ever coming back???"").  Id say, go here for the beer, sans root, but thats about it.  Otherwise, skip this place and drive out to Four Peaks...youll be happier all around."
2,"The actual restaurant is fine, the service is friendly and good. I am not going to go in to the food other than to say, no. Oh well $340 bucks and all I can muster is a no."
5,I love this store!  They have an amazing staff and the most modern clothes!  I set my appointments with a few of the employees and I always get compliments on my outfits when I go out!!  Hats off to the Ted Baker team in Scottsdale Fashion Square!
5,"I love this PHO and spring rolls, and for the friendly and fast service plus its cheap! Oh its truly a must try place."
4,love the gyro plate. Rice is so good and I also dig their candy selection :)
4,"went for lunch today with my girlfriend.  i had the chicken tacos and she had the mahi tacos.  you get three little tacos per order.  we switched one for one.  the chicken was freakin great.  i had a small chicken bone and some cartilidge in mine and i still loved it.  seasoned well and dressed well with an adobo sauce, maybe.  it had some green cabbage, some sliced fresno peppers and what i think was manchego.    i loved it.  the girl had fried mahi tacos  (they offered the option of grilled rather than fried).  it was good, had some remoulade and the same cabbage and fresnos on it.  it was all good.  the service, the food, the atmosphere, and the whole package.  go here, eat here.  be happy.  quality over quantity. always.  well done mission staff, well done"
4,"Good food in a unique setting with fantastic service.  Nobou at Teeter House offers up a very pleasurable dining experience. Ill start with the great.  The restaurant is in a more than 100-year-old house in the heart of downtown Phoenix.  There is nearly a perfect feeling that I have been invited inside someones home for a fancy dinner party.  The staff was fantastic.  Our server, Alexis, was very attentive, friendly, fast, and really knew the menu (or at least was good at selling every dish with a very thorough description about the technique and flavors used to create it).  The presentation of the food is creative and beautiful.  The not-so-great.  The food is served in small portions at a high price.  I wouldnt have a big problem with that, I actually think Americans should be more into tapas eating, except nothing we ordered blew my mind or taste buds away.  Dont get me wrong; everything we ordered was excellent.  The food is perfectly cooked, seasoned, sauced, and artistically plated.  It just didnt have that over-the-top ""WOW"" factor I was hoping for. Having said that.  Nobuo at Teeter House is still a place that everyone should try out at least once.  Its an enjoyable place to eat.  Its probably a fun place to go with a small group of friends just to hang out, order a lot of plates and just sample what the restaurant has to offer. As I said, the price can be a little high.  It took five plates and a dessert to create a fair size meal for just two people.  That came to nearly a $100 tab (with drinks).  But Nobuo at Teeter House is on Local Dines (http://www.localdines.com/?ref=19485) with a $50 or $25 gift certificate.  Take advantage of the deal and cross Nobuo off your Phoenix restaurant bucket list."
5,"I love guerreros!  I worked in Mesa 15 years ago and we did burrito runs here all the time. Im a huera, but my Hispanic pals all rated this place authentic.  Its a husband and wife team that runs it.  The best thing are the beans - incidentally, thats how I rate the authenticity of Mexican fare- They are the kind of beans I ate in Nogales during college (at a place I could only locate while intoxicated).  Thinner, lighter colored, and delicious compared to any Ive EVER had this side of the border.  I live in PV now- super far - but after this I think Im gonna have to take a road trip tomorrow to Mesa! Yum!"
4,"I dig the Vig. Good food and a great atmosphere/patio. If you like Bocce Ball, then you should definitely check it out, but go soon before it starts to warm up again and be sure to take the Vig Rig home if youre blasted."
1,"A couple Saturdays ago, went with my mom to get my name added to her accounts should the unthinkable happen. We first went to Chase which took all of ten minutes. The personal banker was great - in-out-done.  Then we headed to her Credit Union at approximately 10:00 AM. They were quite busy, apparently. When we checked in, I heard grumbling from other customers and asked the wait time.  I was told there were two people ahead of us in line and it ""shouldnt be long."" 30 minutes later, my mom went to ask how much longer it would take. Jennfer, who was manning the reception desk, dismissed her rudely in front of a lobby of customers. My mom is as sweet as tea in Tennesee, so to hear her called out in front of a lobby of people as a disruption was upsetting.  45 minutes later, I went up to ask if it would be much longer. Jennifer said curtly, ""Were busy."" Apparently, on Saturdays, theyre busy and one should avoid transacting business there on the weekend. I dont recall being spoken to so rudely at even a fast food restaurant in recent years... Another ten minutes or so went by (as did my deadline to make another appointment I had made), I was told it would be ""two more minutes"", as I had to go through their background check to be a member. They were having a difficult time with my Washington Driver License and the weird characters it has (an asterisk in part of the number). After all was said and done, over an hour later, I was approved to be a member and was successfully put as a signer on my moms account. I asked for Jennifers card, as I told her I was not happy with the way she had spoken to me or my mother, and I intended to speak with her manager.  To that I received a reply she did not have one. The woman sitting next to her informed me she was the assistant manager and that they were busy on Saturdays. My biggest beef was this: If it was going to be an hour to speak with someone, tell me. I can make other arrangements or come in during the week. Being told first, ""It shouldnt be long,"" and then, ""Were busy"" is not an excuse. If the business is so overwhelming on Saturdays, perhaps it would be wise to staff more people, extend the hours, or inform people of the wait theyre likely to experience because of the queue. Or dont open on Saturdays! As a 20 year veteran of the service industry, I am very disappointed at the level of service Arizona Federal Credit Union provided my mom and me, but also all the other people I watched be dismissed like the Credit Union was doing them a favor. After doing some searching for a new home for moms money, she can get a much better rate at a (four letter word forthcoming) BANK! Im normally a big fan of member-owned institutions, but based on the incredibly rude serviced I received from Arizona Federal Credit Union, Id say go to a Credit Union or Bank where the employees actually read the mission statement that is painted on the wall behind them."
4,confirmed better than subway blimpie quiznos etc etc Not really much else to say that hasnt been said above. Wished they had more vegetarian options :(
5,"Service is good... The newer waitors tend to forget youre there. Food is delicious, never gotten food poisoning... Cheesecake is magnificent... The best kind is the Godiva, expensive bit worth it!"
2,"Played today, course in decent shape for the money.  Would be nice if they would educate groundskeepers on not running mower up to you when trying to play.  Also would be nice if beverage service would continue after 4 oclock.  Course was packed play was slow and no beverage service.  Called in but pro shop phones shut off at 4 30 .  No ranger on course either to keep groups moving ended up not finishing eighteen,teed off at 12 30."
5,"I really adore this place. Theyve got some of the best lentil soup around and all of their chicken dishes have been perfectly seasoned and very, very juicy. I recently got the kabob plate and it came out so tender and juicy it was falling apart on my fork. Their hummus and garlic sauce are both very good as well and the service is quick and friendly.  Last time I was in, I noticed they expanded their dining section so the place is a bit bigger now, probably to accommodate the increase in customers from the park-and-ride light rail station right in front of their restaurant. Do yourself the favor. If youre heading on the light rail and feel hunger strike, stop off here and enjoy a nice meal. They have good lunch specials around $7.50 for a full plate with meat, hummus, garlic sauce, pita, and tabouli. Mmmm!"
2,"For some reason, these people seem to think its OK to price a tank top, that probably has less thread count than my thong and cost about 17cents of labor to make, at $50.  They also seem to think that dressing up their mannequins like paraplegic color and pattern blind grandmas gives them business. Oh wait...it does! Because this is Tempe. And Tempe, as I cant over-repeat, is the devil."
5,"Cheese Curds!   They have been so hard to find in AZ.    Like the Jalepeno ones too. Really good fresh milk.   Worth the stop. Bring cash, not credit or debit cards"
4,"Tried this place for weekday lunch.  We arrived before noon and good thing since they have a big lunch crowd.  (not to worry, plenty of parking in back and seating outside w/ misters)  Kudos to Aric and Monica for stopping by our table several times to make sure service was great or they fixed it.  We started with the Bruchetta, which was piled high.  The we had the Smokey (arugula & smoked prosciutto) and the Marg pizzas. Almost had the Pabst on tap, but went for the Dunkel since its harder to find.  As if the food wasnt enough, the decor and ambiance was over the top.  The herb garden as you walk in and the bar with the salon chairs was a nice touch.  Cant wait to go back."
1,Like watching a train wreck in slow motion will definitely be going somewhere else for bagels from now on disappointing have been going there for years.  The eight day old cream cheese was a nice touch (yuck!)
3,"This club has great bands.  I saw 68 Guns and Metal Elvis here.  Also at the Metal Elvis show was a Van Halen tribute band called VH Too.  The music is top notch and it is usually not too crowded so you can go right up to the stage.  However, there are only a few tables, which is annoying if you need a place to put your drink or coat or something.  I also wish the ceilings were a bit higher.  Would be better if they could combine an indoor/outdoor area with the stage.  Overall the building seems cramped, small and old.  The prices are reasonable though.  The location is kind of strange however.  We took a cab there but when we wanted to leave we couldnt get one to come pick us up despite the staff saying they called one.  Finally we walked to a gas station and called from there.  This reminds me too much of Club Red.  Great bands, crappy club.  I hope that someone opens a brand new club for bands of this caliber.  Or else I will need to open one myself."
5,I love the menu here it has many selections of many cultures including Italian!!!
4,"We stopped in here on a hot summer afternoon, grumpy because we had been on a wild goose chase for mint. Couldnt find it anywhere, like Frys, Bashas, or TJs, even in those teeny tiny overpriced little packages. They have it here in big bunches for something ridiculous like 59 cents. Since we had friends coming over for mojitos, this made me happy! Its just about mojito season again, so Ill be headed back to this location. The produce section was large and had some good-looking stuff in it. The location isnt really too scary."
4,"Some buddies and I went to Scottsdale for a golfing boondoggle last week and a couple of guys in the know directed us to The Mission. DANG! We let our server, Jonathan, drive the car so to speak.  He quizzed us on our likes and dislikes and brought us our orders (we didnt specifically order).  We had 7 people in our group and every plate was spot on.   We started with the chicken (thigh) tostadas and the crispy cola pork belly tostadas.  They were great; particularly the pork belly ones.  MAN were those good.  My dinner was the Chorizo Porchetta which brought a big hunk of slow cooked pork that shredded beautifully.  Along side this hunka hunka porky love was a salt block carrying 10 small corn tortillas to build little tacos from.  Some tasty accompaniments: sauce, onion, & cilantro, finished the presentation.  It was a fantastic dish.  The other 6 dishes were just as great.  To note: the honey chipotle grits that my buddy got were super tasty.  Especially when you dumped some of their ghost chili sauce (forget what it was called).  Desert was the Pumpkin bread pudding (YUM!) and fried bananas.   All in all, a fantastic place.  Really good."
4,"The Good:  Really good burger. Good fries. The Bad: Terrible paint and lighting. Cant even hang out for long. (Maybe that is the idea.) Dont like high booth stalls much. JMHO of course. Also a note to the sewage smell that others noted. That little area on that side of the mall has smelled like hell for years for some odd reason. It sucks for the businesses, but I assure you it has nothing to do with Smashburger alone nor should it cause any health concerns. Just luck of the draw on a bad sewer vent problem. Update: 4/18/10 Went again. Really very good. Decor is still not my fav but the food is solid. Like I said, it is the juiciest burger I have had in a while. Shoestring fries are kill. Upped from 3 stars to four."
3,"I finally tried Spicy Pickle last week. I like the name and was intrigued about their menu. Paninis, soups, salads, pizzetas, nothing out of the ordinary. I had a half sandwich ( Sausalito Bandido?), half salad combo ( Spinach salad). Food was fresh and good. The sandwich could have stand a little more meat, it was truly flat. The salad was crisp and dressing was on the side, which I appreciated.   On my way out I got a chocolate chip cookie that was OK. I love cookies and they have to be pretty bad for me not to like them. This one, I kid you not, must have had maybe 3-4 chocolate chips? So if youre craving chocolate, this is not the cookie for you."
5,"Such strange combinations of flavors, yet they taste so good.  Weve been here three or four times and are never disappointed."
4,"Delux makes good burgers, but you probably figured that out already. They also have good fries (sweet and regular potato thank you very much). They are kinda expensive. If I have to compare it to something I would compare it to California Pizza Kitchen. Better than a regular Pizza, but probably not worth the cost."
1,"There are few resources in Arizona for dancers, actors and performers, so its best to order online if you have the time to wait for shipping. Dees Dancewear is overpriced and because they know they are the only game in town, their customer service (and return policies) have suffered. In an emergency situation, youre better suited going to Mischas Dancewear on 33rd Ave and Bell or Capezios in Scottsdale. Otherwise, order online and steer clear of this establishment when possible."
4,"This place is awesome!  Where else can you hear incredible live jazz music for free on a Monday night with reasonably priced drinks?  Any other major city (like, say, New York), the cover would be at least $15, and they would make you pay for the second set, as well, and a place to sit or stand with a decent view of the musicians would be hard to come by, and by the end of the night you would end up feeling ripped off.   Granted, this place can get crowded on the weekends, but no wonder.  The beer (no draft) and wine selection is good, the vibe is laid-back, and the music Ive heard has been great (Ive only see one group here--Jiggle--and they play jazz.) Tip for music-lovers:  Sit or stand in the room where the music is.  Sitting any farther back and you may be tempted to take a swing at the people who just come to chat and fail to understand what makes the Lost Leaf so unique.  But do give them a bit of a break.  They are, after all, probably ""paying"" for your cover charge with all their imbibing of alcohol."
4,"Well, Ive been to Liberty Market several times now and its time to add my two cents. Yes, I know, there are already 250+ Reviews, what more could I add? Dont worry, Ill stick to the facts; consider this the cliff-notes version. Take the first parking spot you can find or drive the the lot west of the building. Walk in, grab a menu, and get in line.  With all of the goodness on the menu, try to make your decision before you get to the register.   A few of my favorites 1. CORTADITO - coffee drinkers, do NOT miss this one!  Cuban miro-latte, on the sweeter side, served in a pair of espresso shots or a bowl, perfection! 2. Rancher Salad - steak, caramelized onions, blue cheese, arugula, do I have to keep going? 3. Sweet Potato Salad - a unique salad, SO much better than your average potato salad 4. Cinnamon Rolls the size of a human face, if youre into to that kind of thing, share with a friend, or four. there are more, but I promised to keep it short. Back to the line. As youre making up your mind, be ready to answer the number of people in your party so they can set you up with a table.  Try to resist the incredible looking, super-sized pastries and desserts in the case, or not, what the heck, just get it!.  Pay the friendly cashier, proceed to the fountain drink station to fill your glasses, and maneuver the maze of tables to find the one with your number. Just a few tips.  One, it can get a little noisy in there, so may not be the best place if youre planning a discussion over your meal. Two, LM gets busy and the staff is always trying to find a table for the guests in line by the time they finish at the register.  So, while the dining room attendants are friendly and attentive, they are definitely trying to turn the table as soon as youll let them. And now you know what to expect.  If you dont like lines or loud places, this might not be your favorite place. Overall, delicious, fresh food and shinny, happy people to bring it to you.  Lets just say LM is enough to get me out of my five mile Ahwatukee radius, and that is hard to do! Now you know the scoop . . . Im out!  Enjoy!"
1,"The cheesy breadsticks were delicious.  Everything else, not so much."
5,very wonderful and romantic place to take your loved one :)
4,"Oooooh, I liked it, very much so!  Just sad that I didnt get to try more of its myriad offerings, especially the pizza.  We enjoyed a lovely brunch here on a Friday.  Cute little place, lots of ambiance, good people watching (quite the hopping place on this midsummer day), tasty food.  We had a round of Bloody Marys, and those were nicely done, as well.  A great spot to just hang and nosh and chitchat with friends."
4,"One of the best sports bars in the valley. Tons of screens (although some of the big screen projectors could be updated). Nice big drafts and the food is always tasty. Try the teriyaki chicken sandwich with fries its awesome. Upstairs they have shuffleboard and pool tables. Golden tee 2009 downstairs with another pool table. If you like loud sports bars where the patrons get into the game this is the spot to go. Plenty of fun to be had. People say too many kids but I guess I go later on at night and never have seen a problem with little kids.?. The service is on and off here, sometimes its been great sometimes its been useless."
4,"Could use a remodeling job, but the food is really good for the area.  The wait staff is very attentive, and the free chips and hot sauce for dipping, are REALLY GOOD.  The fajitas are my usual.  Worth the visit and youll leave satisfied."
5,"Very friendly staff, or a fast food place-- their customer service and friendliness is unmatched.. I go more often than not simply because of the experience every time! Thanks Micky!"
5,"I cant believe this wasnt reviewed yet!  This place rocks, and Dr. Heather is the very best vet in town. Shes reasonable in price, thorough in her evaluations, and super kind. She handled the life and death issues so carefully and warmly, and she talks about her own pets and has compassion!  When our cat Everett died, she not only called us throughout the whole cremation process, but she sent a card and when we picked up the ashes - she had made a single footprint ""ornament"" with a ribbon and his name on it as a gift.  Never had a vet do anything so kind.   We have had MANY cats and MANY VETS.  I know a good vet. Go here. Please go here!"
5,"I can always count on Sacks.   It is always fresh and always tasty and the sandwiches are so creative that years later Im still not sure how they get those fabulous blends and tastes that they do.   I try to hit lunch a little off the lunch hour and then the crowds are not so bad and I can find parking but, its worth it to eat a little latter when I know the meal will be so satisfying I can go back to work and be so productive.   Sacks is my ""go to place"" when I have a guest or friend that I want to be well fed and satisfied too."
3,"Food is great, but service is horrible.  The servers are rude and it took a 30 minutes to get our drinks and another 30 for our food. I really liked this place when it first opened.  We live in the area and had hoped for this to be a regular place for us to come to eat, drink and meet friends. I hope the management fixes the problem with the service.  If you are going to try this place, I suggest you sit at the bar for better service."
2,"dragged my husband here because the menu online lists a particular kind of spring roll that i love. and when we show up, the menu was TOTALLY different.  this place is geared toward your typical Arizona-white crowd. its pretty watered down Viet food, and was sorely disappointing. and expensive. boo. go across the street to Mekong if you prefer better tasting, more authentic Viet food."
5,"I have been shopping at Lee Lees for over ten years.  The store stocks Chinese, Malaysian, Korean, Japanese, West Indian and other foods.  You can usually find what you are looking for here.   The fish selection is vast, fresh and reasonably priced.   They have the finest selection of noodles and yerba mate tea!!! Enjoy"
3,"Ive gotten lunch take out here a few times. The only thing Ive tried is the drunken noodles. While I think they are pretty decent, I have been having serious issues getting the right spicy-nes. The first time I got them, I asked for level 3 spicy. Their spice meter goes from 0-5. I love love hot and spicy Thai food, however these noodles were practically inedible. Yet, they were so delicious at the same time I devoured the entire thing. And I felt like I was going to die later, as my stomach felt like a fishnet stocking... The second time I ordered them I asked for level 2 spicy. This time they were not spicy at all. At all!! They were so bland. I mean, they still tasted good, but were missing that drunken noodle kick! So, at this point I dont know what to do. Obviously every cook there must have a different idea of what each number means.  The last time I ordered from here, I simply said drunken noodles. I didnt specify a spicy level. I figured maybe this would give me the perfect in between spicy that I so desired! Well, when I got them, they were more bland than the level 2. And tasted kinda weird.  I will give them another try as they are right across the street from my work, and I hope we can work out our spicy issues!  4 stars for the service, theyre really friendly here 2 stars for the food, until we can work out our issues And 4 stars for the convenience!"
4,"When Im looking for the more mature, laid back version of Lux, I come to Copper Star. Coffee is not as good but service is great and place is inviting. Great neighborhood favorite."
4,"This place is very off-the-beaten-track, Im sure most people overlook it....I only came across it whilst searching online for somewhere different to eat...and when I came across the review on the Phoenix New Times website(http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2005-02-10/dining/sultans-of-shish/), I knew this was it... I only docked a star for the (extremely) sparse decor and atmosphere...this place could have been any other type of business with just a change of sign and omission of tables... anyway, the food was great! my fiance ordered skewers of beef and lamb(Im not too keen on lamb, but the beef was tender and succulent...very well spiced!)...I had a cucumber salad(diced, along with onions and parsley, and soaked in vinegar-lemon juice), which enchanted me so much that I created my own version at home and make it every time I feel like doing a bit of dicing(msg me for the recipe--its a bit death-breathy and labor-intensive but delicious!)... and, during dessert, I could see why Samarkand was voted Best Tea in Phoenix...the black tea was easily the best Ive ever had(besides a special brand of blue ginger tea I make a point to keep my cabinet stocked with)...it was strong and rich...absolutely incredible! definitely make it a point to search this place out--its worth the effort!"
4,"I cant believe Ive never reviewed this place before. Ive been here countless times before, and watched the place get upgraded and remodeled several years ago. I cant remember the first time I came here, but it was some time ago after I moved out here. The convention center has an older part thats smaller, and a new addition thats huge!  Plenty of events are held here all year round, from sporting events like the NBA all star game, to the auto show, they had an NRA convention a couple years ago with a zillion people, along with other regular yearly events like the auto show and several others. The place is large, and has 3 levels (a basement area, main level and upper level) with a crosswalk to get to the other side which is pretty darn cool. Its huge, spacious, and modern looking with its updates.  Escalators, stairs, etc.  The place is sparsely decorated with Arizona stuff that makes it really cool looking. They also have a cool light feature outside that illuminates the walkway with different colors at night and is really pretty to look at as well. The cool thing about it is too is that its easily accessible via light rail, and you dont have to spend $$ on parking...and let me tell you, the parking here isnt cheap! $12 for the garage, $10 in lots around, and its not any cheaper the farther away you get.  I dont know why anyone would want to park down here, since the light rail is $3.50 round trip, so save yourself a few bucks and take the rail. Youll thank me later! Theres also food and dining in here as well, with a variety of different style resturants, but again, its outrageously expensive!  They have a starbucks here too, which is their regular prices, but is like an extra $5 a person to eat here, so dine elsewhere before you come in here.  (minus the coffee since Starbucks is the only reasonably priced place in here.)  Plus, the convention center is a hop, skip and a jump from about a zillion other cool dining places that your better off eating at anyways, so do that instead. Aside from that, this place is pretty huge, and its worth checking out. Plenty of clean pretty bathrooms and tons to do in and outside of the center with variety of different sized spaces to hold any kind of event, large or small."
1,"Glad this place has new ownership... I should probably remove the review below, Its really harsh and doesnt apply to the NEW establishment.  You have been warned ;)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Short Review: THIS PLACE SUCKS BALLS Long Review: We were supposed to meet a friend here at Draft House on Saturday night. We were excited to be out on a date-like experience cuz its been a while. We went to my in-laws for dinner and then headed to Draft... I knew it was going to be interesting from the sound of the music as we pulled into the strip mall.  The music: Good music, probably the only good thing about this place - if youre a hip-hop fan. All hip-hop, all night.  The crowd: Ghetto fab all the way! Seems like everyone there is late 20s - early 30s (and some older sprinkled throughout the crowd) and none realize its not 1996 anymore. Expect to hear a lot of fake accents a la Da Bronx and a lot of misuse of slang terms. It was entertaining until it became annoying. Oh and people WILL steal your seats or tell you they are saved - ugh! The atmosphere: small, crowded...  Small dance floor.  A couple pool tables, but dont expect to get one. Some TVs playing various sports, which I guess qualifies this place as a ""sports cafe""??  The service: OMG, we had one beer each and the ""line"" was retarded, over 30 minutes to tab out. No line in sight, just people crowding together, trying to get to the front of the line.  Oh! and LOL.. the bar tenders are total morons, one of them complained to the guy next to us about his crappy tip and the other argued with his customer about whether they ordered rum and cokes or redbull and vodka.  The guy had already made the rum and cokes and was pissed that HE got it wrong.  Weirdos! If any of this appeals to you this is your place!  BTW her friend didnt show and we ended up going to Skip n Jans to play some pool :o)  We had a great time there :o)"
2,"Strange just strange. I park here when I travel out of town. I used the valet parking once last year and dont remember any issues. Today was my second time... I dropped my car off last week. The airport shuttle was waiting for me at baggage claim when my flight landed at midnight. I went to pick up my car after a long flight as was told ""its at the front"", the valet guy pointed and disappeared. I was left standing alone wondering if there was another side of the hotel where my car was?? I walked into the lobby and the receptionist was quick to tell me there is a balance on my account. Huh?? Number one I dont have an account at the hotel and number two I didnt stay here overnight. Again Im standing there thinking what is going on, is he getting my mixed up with someone else? Finally he explained the parking wasnt prepaid and I needed to pay in a order to get my car. He gave me a bit of an attitude as if I was refusing to pay. Dude, its 12:30am, I just got off a long flight & didnt realize my fiancé didnt prepay online when he set the whole thing up for me online. All this confusion could have been spared if the valet guy would have just said ""you pay at the desk"" instead of ""its at the front"" which is unclear and indirect. I think next time I go out of town ill try a different parking garage."
3,"Tried Rock Bottom tonight before a movie and I thought it was ok. I had the Lemon Grilled Chicken with Mashed Potatoes and Asparagus.  Everything was very yumm, but Rock Bottom just didnt make enough of an impression on me. If I was obsessed with beer maybe it would have gone over better. Restaurant ambiance and menu were very typical and neither were impressive. However my crazy friend Megan ordered Buffalo Fajitas, yes real buffalo steak, so that was a cool menu option.  Now I can add Buffalo to the list of crazy things Ann Marie has eaten. p.s Buffalo tastes a lot like steak."
5,"Stephen G. hit the nail on the head - ""You buy a peaceful experience"". I was looking for a resort/spa but also wanted to take advantage of horseback riding as much as I could. This resort definitely exceeded my expectations - the staff is AMAZING (friendly, accommodating, etc), the food was delicious, the resort is beautiful and the rooms were also clean and well-maintained. Everyone I encountered went the extra mile with regard to service. I came back to NYC completely rejuvenated."
4,This place is great. The Pizzas are single serving or post salad and some of the best Pizza Ive ever had. Salads are good and and service is excellent.  Keep it Simple Stupid KISS
3,"The food is as good as the Coronado location but the ambiance is seriously lacking. The inside had a funky smell so we opted for 100 degree heat and ate outside instead. The main reason for three instead of four stars is that they screwed up our order. Not a huge offense, you say? Well they put their uber spicy jalepenos on my toddlers quesadilla instead of on my burrito. They replaced it but still...  Bottom line: their food is good- love the carne and pork. Well eat here again but Ill be double checking to make sure the order is right."
4,So happy Los Dos Molinos is in the east valley! Los Dos makes it spicy so come prepared to drink a lot of margaritas...not like thats a bad thing. Great food & great prices!
4,"I went here with my mom while my dad had a dinner meeting. The atmosphere is hip but its also got a mature setting. It is a really great place for young adults and even older ones. The price was good, the food was amazing! The portions were also big and MOST the staff was friendly. I overheard two rude staff members making fun of the customers. However they might not even work there anymore. Great place!"
4,"Everything is awesome at this place, and authentic according to my Japanese friend. I just love the fact that they have more than just sushi. Their fish with rice dish was amazing. Since Ive come to AZ, Ive never seen this dish at any Japanese restaurants around here. The staff is all Japanese, with somewhat limited English, so I guess you know youre at an authentic place."
4,Zipps is a rocking place with TV screens in all viewable angles. The atmosphere is great and this place really packs it in on game nights like Monday Night Football. Smoking is outside because this place is around the Tempe border. The service is great and the food is even better. Try the chicken tacos! Good times had by all! Check it out some time!
5,"Alas...Ive given up the idea of writing a review for a place if it isnt at least 4 stars. Sue me; Im in the industry.  Fuego Bistro is by far one of the best places Ive been to recently. I was introduced to it this last weekend on a date. Ironically, its super close to my house yet Ive never heard of it. When we were arriving, I was a little curious to see where the hell he was taking me since there arent any signs really and its pretty hidden. Once we were inside, though, it was like finding a little treasure. The patio is welcoming & even though we didnt have a reservation (aka we couldnt sit outside) we snagged a table close enough to enjoy the beautiful weather.  We started off with a round of mojitos and even though its been a few years since theyve won best mojito...I can say the Prickly Pear was the best Ive had in a while. The Ahi Tostadas followed & they were awesome...the sauce added a kick to it & it was a perfect start to the meal. After, we shared the Fuego Pasta with chorizo, chicken, mushrooms, peppers, & a chipotle cream sauce...huge! What I did eat of it was delicious. My favorite (and my dates Im fairly certain) was the special...an herb crusted Mahi Mahi with a pineapple sauce, home-made cornbread, & chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes. Amazing. Even though the Mahi Mahi might be hard to come by if you visit, the two sides arent & are so good, Im droolin just thinking about it. :) Dessert? Try the banana burrito. Heaven on the tongue! Kevin was an excellent server which just highlights the night. Its hard to have a great meal without great service but he provided just that. If youre in the area...check it out. If you arent...check it out. Im pretty sure you wont be disappointed."
5,"Easy 5 star fun at the Phoenix Zoo. Ive never seen critters so closeup before. At the Monkey Village, they dont even have cages. The giraffes came right up to us. I spent half my beer money on fishheads and shrimp feeding the stingrays. It was a blast! We had great time! yow, bill PS - Ive never commented on other peoples reviews before. But jeez. When someone goes to the zoo and complains about the cost of a hot dog or a snow cone... well, for spider monkeys sake, get a clue!"
1,"Lets just say i was not to please with my experience at Nails R Us. After two days my nails were lifting on about 4 nails by the end of the weekend i had 6 nails lifting, so i went back and showed them and she was like its normal. No it normal to lift but not after 2 days! They did fix them for me free of charge but were very rude to me!!! Will not be going back there or will not refer any of my friends there!"
5,"Love it, love it, love it! I have been eating at various Pita Jungles around the Valley since I moved to AZ over 6 years ago and I have yet to have anything that I didnt love. My favorites include the Black Bean Burger, Lentil Fetoosh Salad, all three hummus types, dolmas, and gazpacho, but everything is delicious, so you really cant go wrong! The Tempe location also has breakfast, which is amazing!  Each location is fairly small, so luch and dinner may require a short wait, but its worth it. The prices are fair and the portions are huge! Dont be afraid to split a dish with a loved one."
3,"My boyfriend, myself, and his 3 year old foster sister met up with his mom, dad, and 2 year old foster sister. We were all heading up to Prescott this past Saturday (1/30) to play in the snow. When we got there, they were already set up with drinks & pancake balls (strange, yet greasy & delicious). Theyd placed our orders as well since they texted us for them when we were still 15min or so behind them. The food was good. The service was just okay this time since I cant remember if anyone ever came to give refills on anyones drinks. I know they came by and asked if everything was okay a few times, but that was it. Still, friendly staff. The bathrooms werent anything spectacular, but its a bathroom...at a Dennys.  Anyways, we all left full and went on about our day."
4,"Neiman Marcus is a great addition to my shopping go-to locations like Nordstrom, and well, Nordstrom. I usually only shop at Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus, sometimes Saks. Anyway. Neiman Marcus has impecable customer service but know that you kind of need to ""dress up"" to shop here. At least I feel uncomfortable if I come in in yoga gear. The selection is a nice compliment to Nordstrom -- much more tailored and designer specific. My boyfriend loves their mens section.  I love their selection of Chanel handbags and other great purses. Plus, the layout of the store is just luxurious and calming. They dont carry MAC here but I love the Chanel, Christian Dior, and Laura Mercier counters.  My ONLY complaint is their hours. Ugh. They close at 7 Monday through Saturday and 5 on Sunday. Its an hour earlier than the rest Scottsdale Fashion Square so there have been many times where Ive trekked from Nordstrom to Neimans only to find they are closed.  If you dont want to go through the mall there is complimentary valet at Neimans. You can park in their private lot but its on a hill and narrow so if Im feeling rushed I just valet....but Im also not the best at parking. NOTE: the only credit card they accept is AMEX. Otherwise its cash or check. Thats right, no Visa, no Mastercard"
3,"Closed?  Really?  It seems this place just randomly shut down, after much less than a year of being open.  Only went there once - we enjoyed the food, the ambiance, and the beer.  We recommended it to others as well.  Showed up on a Tuesday night for dinner and everything was packed up....?  A little searching on the web (Facebook, specifically) shows that theyre done.  What a shame."
1,"I do not like this KFC ...or any really for that matter. Every time I have been here the place is filthy. I know they remolded the place and I have not been since then, so I am not sure if the conditions are the same. The food is just not good in any way anymore. Not that it was ever great, but you could get some decent chicken and some sides and be content. What the hell have they done to the mac & cheese? It is so gross..the color is just not appealing and the taste is worse. Food at this place has been served under temperature enough times to keep me from returning."
1,yuk! service and food sucked never a gain!
5,"I have been exploring more of the park recently.  I want to add that the National Trail (which is almost 15 miles long and goes from one end to the other) is a real gem.  The views on this trail are outstanding, and on the western half, you will find far fewer people than on the eastern half.  Highly recommended."
4,"I feel like an East Coast gangster when I roll up to LGO for breakfast. Ill take the Jersey Girl... pump fist and hair toss!! Hands down, its the BEST omelette Ive EVER had. And the fresh-squeezed OJ hits the spot.  After a hike at Camelback, its relaxing to come and sit on the patio... if you can find a spot. Weekends this place is a zoo!! During the week is pretty crazy but has its peaks.  The French Toast is pretty tasty and they do pastries just right. Muffins are baked fresh, toast is always spot on perfect. I want their toaster! Ive had the pizza, which is pretty decent but not the best Ive eaten. The salads are delish."
5,"I love Tasty Kabob!  Their food is always excellent, and I try to make it back there whenever I return to the Valley.  I always order their chicken shish kabob entree, which comes in a generous portion that includes rice and grilled vegetables.  The chicken is always tender, well-marinated, and equally well-seasoned.  Their beef shish kabob entree is also very good. Try shaking a little sumac spice onto the rice and meat for some extra flavor, or just enjoy it as is.  Its difficult to choose from their list of appetizers and side dishes, but their hummus is always creamy and smooth, and I love their shirazi salad.  Their spicy beans dish, however, is, by far, my personal favorite, and I always make sure to order it.  Just as important as the food is the friendly service I encounter whenever I visit.  The couple who own the restaurant always make you feel welcome.  Good food and service that makes you feel at home, what more can you ask for?  Simply put, Tasty Kabob is one of the best."
5,"Really great food and service, and it worked out just fine for my two kids, ages 7 and 10. (Meatball pizza was a hit for the younger one; the older one shared sausage pizza and mussels.) The food came very quickly. We had all small plates and pizza, not entrees: kale chips, fried chickpeas, peppers, mozzarella salad. Dessert was great. The mousse was first rate, and the parsnip creme brulée was delicious (though we couldnt taste any parsnip; it just tasted like excellent, flavorful creme brulée). One of the best meals we had in Arizona. And we also really liked the decor. Simple, elegant, and also fun/creative. Not sure why anyone would ding them for that. Also, the portion sizes were just fine. We all left full but not feeling gross. Were from MA, and were unaware of the chefs celebrity. I wonder if some of the griping here is just celebrity bashing, or a reaction against some sort of hype? Im outside that loop, but it just struck us as an excellent and fun place with great food and no pretension. Just thorough competence. Note: Its a nice walk from the Arizona Biltmore Hotel. Under 2 miles."
4,"Try the deep dish, the smallest size can easily feed 3-4 people, its SOOO think and yummy.  Great staff and food, what more can you ask for?"
4,"Best pizza Ive had in Arizona hands down. My best friend lives in AZ, my friends and I stopped by this place and enjoyed surprisingly wonderful tasting pizza a must try. When I went here they were playing underground hip-hop which I am a fan of. It made it a great atmosphere to enjoy my food. I highly recommend this place I live in California and this place still comes to mind. Great for college students and the fam bam."
3,Been closed for a long time.
4,"I stopped by early this morning to satisfy my crave for something new. The place is very clean and a man came out to greet me and was ready to serve. He clearly explained every item I was curious about since the labels were in Spanish. I asked if his name was Miguel and he said yes. I told him I read about his bakery on Yelp. Then he said that he loves Yelp and thats how word is going around now for him and he also uses to find reviews on other places. He was very friendly and had lots of patience. I was the only customer at the time and he actually doesnt mind having a conversation unlike open ended talks with others. I ended up buying 10 pastries and it cost $6.80. What a great deal! They also sell other items such as tamales, burritos, and menudo. I inquired about the burritos cuz I like mine with a little kick,but unfortunately they werent ready yet. He showed me the homemade tortillas and he says he used them on the burritos. He said they dont look big, but he assured that the burritos are filled with red (mild) or green (with a kick) chili, shredded pork, and some potatoes. He said that one burrito is good to fill up a person. So...I must come back and try it.  So far Ive had the flaky pastry with the shredded coconut and Bavarian cream...the Bavarian wasnt as creamy than Im used to. I almost thought it would have been better off to not have it, but its a nice added flavor when you eat it all together rather than just tasting the Bavarian on its on.  I had that curvy, pretty looking pastry which is topped with crystal sugars and with all the sugar on top, I thought it might be too sweet, but nope. It was just fine with the pineapple filling (excuse me as I wipe my drool).  Then it was off to have the caramel flautas dusted with powdered sugar. The first bite was eh. The second bite was...um. Third bite, WOW! I finally reached the part that had more caramel in it and I LOVE IT!!! Did I mention that Im not a big fan of caramel? This caramel is sweet and creamy. Its just so good! A definitely must have for next time. Thats about as much my tummy let me eat for today. Im sure the rest will be just as good and I cant wait till tomorrow morning to try to rest of my goodies."
4,"This Chilis isnt a lot different than the one on Mill.  However, not being on Mill does have its advantages with not being full of college kids all the time.  The service is pretty good and its crowded all that often.  You can have a quiet dinner here more than at the one on Mill.  Pretty good Chilis here."
2,Dont get Breonna as your server. Didnt ask if we wanted another drink after we decided to stick to appetizers. She didnt appear to know where the water was or remembered we were at one of her tables. Food was good as always.
2,"I love love love consignment stores...and walking in this store, the smell was great...  however... I have to say i am disappointed with My Sisters Closet. I had heard such great things, so I was really excited to go. They did have some amazing designer purses, including a $3400 jimmy chu purse that was huge and gorgeous for $1899.   The designer section clothing was hung on nice wooden hangers with their logo (Nice touch).  However....... The items I saw around the store, and my friend with me agreed, seemed like more than 40% really were more appropriate for a thrift store, and a lot of the items were really dirty (and still had high prices). You could see food stains on a dooney bag.. a coach wristlet, black, had white food smeared all over it... still highly priced for as dirty as it is. The thing is... even if it is a brand.. sometimes your store reputation is worth more than the 10 bucks youll make by selling something dirty. Just my .02.  I saw sensors put though jeans pockets, wallets (in the leather!) and other questionable placements. When I asked about it.. the sales person just said, well maybe there is someone new who does not put it in the right place. That damages items people are buying, and they may not realize the big holes placed by those sensors.  I loved there ""on the web"" tags. Ive never seen that before, but they are really pretty and catch your eye if you want to take a closer look.  I prefer consignment stores to identify the sizes on the hanger by color coding or some such to make it easier to find my sizes. I get bored really fast trying to find my size..  As a consumer, I would have spent more time looking had I been able to really scan the racks easier for size. The shoes are nicely organized.... and clearly labeled. They were not over crowded so it was easy to see the shoes.  There are some positives.. I purchased a le sportsac tiny bag for 9.99, it was new so i do feel it was a good deal.  but really be careful what you buy.. The prices for the purses seemed high for used resale and their obvious usage stains."
3,"No frills.  Nothing fancy.  Just some honest burritos and tacos.  Voted ""best taco"" by New Times a few years back (in the 90s).  Not sure I agree, but they consistently satisfy.  They make a hearty breakfast burrito too.  If youre looking for Sonoran or Tex-Mex or anything beyond what you might find at Filibertos, try somewhere else.  The red burro combo is my personal favorite.  Its saucy (enchilada style) and just spicy enough.  Bottled beer available."
5,great place to go and the pizza ia great too
5,"Awesome place!! EXCELLENT food/apps(try the bleu cheese figs)! Ask for Dizzy Dre, hes AWSOME and listens to your likes and customizes drinks for you!! Very patient with women!! ;)"
4,Yum! Steaks were great! Corn bread large portions definitely worth the price!
1,"IHOP is barely a step up from Dennys in terms of boring chain food. Last night was the first time I ever had dinner there, and it tasted like squishy, mushy cardboard. The food took forever even though there were only three tables in the place with customers. The reason I gave it two stars instead of you is because the breakfasts are pretty good. I dont mind them except the omlettes which are way too oily. The coffee is almost bad, but the waitresses always look happy. [update April 2, 2011] Whyd I go back? I hate this place now. We went today for the first time we have all had a chance to go out together for breakfast. I was excited to do this and was eager. I shouldve stayed home. My wife got a waffle with her combo that was cold, tasted like cardboard, and was crunchy. The bacon my wife and child ordered was burnt, crispy and did not look like bacon at all. My sausage (I always upgrade to turkey sausage since the regular pork kid here is vomit worth) was totally cold. I sent it back and complained. I think she microwaved my plate.  Their coffee is always burnt so I got an iced coffee. She said they had Mocha, Vanilla, or Hazelnut. I asked if they just had a regular coffee flavored one... she said yes, and brought me disgusting hazelnut (glad Im not allergic!!) Ok now its three hours later. My daughter laid on the floor whining about how bad her stomach hurts, Ive been to the bathroom twice and my wife is asleep because she said if she didnt lay down, she would puke. Seriously. The management (district managers) really need to care enough to read YELP.  They remodeled the outside of this place and, I guess, spent all their money to make it look pretty so wed forget they serve dogfood."
5,"This place was great. When one of my coworkers sent an email to our group who was visiting Phoenix saying he had gotten us a reservation at ""The BEST pizza in the country"" i Was skeptical. Best pizza in Phoenix? Well, I wasnt disappointed!  We had a group of 8., and we ordered almost one of everything on the menu: Apps: Antipasto - Wood Roasted Vegetables, Sopressata, Bite of Cheese Spiedini - Italian Fontina wrapped in Prosciutto di Parma, served warm  Pizza: MARGHERITA - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Basil  MARINARA - Tomato Sauce, Oregano, Garlic (No Cheese)  ROSA - Red Onion, Parmigiano Reggiano, Rosemary, AZ Pistachios  SONNY BOY - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Salami, Gaeta Olives  BIANCOVERDE - Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula  WISEGUY - Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage  Of all of them, the Biancoverde was my absolute favorite! I dont eat pork, so I couldnt sample them all, but Id happily order this one again. In fact, my team is returning next week for another team dinner for the coming Phoenix trip, and I will for sure be ordering this. Their house draft beer is also quite tasty! Tip - if you are a party of 6-10, get a reservation! They dont take reservations for smaller groups and Ive heard the wait time can be a few hours at the busiest times! But worth it!"
5,We Care Family Wellness Center is the most exceptional doctors office and staff that I have ever found. Every employee here genuinely cares about you. I highly recommend.
3,"meh...... Im torn. I found this store to be a little bit of a walking contradiction.(okay, not ""walking"" but you dig what Im saying)  Reminds me of myself in alot of ways....not all of which are good.   You see, I recycle EVERYTHING at work because the cute little receptacles are provided for me by waste management thus leading me to not actually think about what Im doing. Plus, I co-manage a 26 story high rise mid-town and with the whole ""green"" movement, wed be setting ourselves up for some major problems if we didnt comply with demand and of course, it does just ""make sense"".     At home, not so much and to be blunt I dont really think twice about it. (go on.....hate)  This is how I feel about Fresh & Easy. Hybrid parking (fkn ridiculous) but no bike rack?? WTF??.....  Tons of bullshit organic produce and no preservatives  but then everything has been super sealed in some weird plastic containers. The F&E brand crapola that I tried was mediocre at best,  also,  it seemed like everything I picked up was within a day of expiration.  I dont know about you F&E. We could be kindred sprits.... but two wrongs dont always make a right."
2,I stopped in for a quick lunch and I wasnt impressed at all.  I heard that the food was good but Ive had better subs almost anywhere.  They have very limited toppings.  I wish I had gone to Mr. Goodcents down the street much better quality subs.
3,just another big store with everything everywhere.
3,"In my effort to live and love local, I try to show Bashas some love since they are a locally owned chain. Everything about this Bashas is just OK. The produce, inventory and service are all par but nothing stands out. I recently bought several baked goods from this Bashas for an event. I was on the hunt for sugar cookies that Santas little elves could decorate during a shopping crawl. They didnt have any out, so I asked the lady behind the counter. She told me they had cookies in the back for a dollar a piece. This was too high for my budget so I politely declined. Then a couple minutes later, she came back and told me they were actually on sale and only $.50, so I decided to buy them. Coincidence that I said no to cookies for a $1 and then they became 50 cents, or just oversight by the employee? Who knows....  During my visit, I also purchased some donuts. I need two dozen donuts and unfortunately they dont have donuts by the dozen pre-made so I ended up making my own. While this is good because you can choose your own, I think it would also be helpful to have pre-made dozens for those in a huge hurry (like I was that day).  In summary, this Bashas is just OK, but I love supporting local so I will continue to shop here!"
4,Was in Phoenix for a softball tournament this past weekend and stayed here cause it was one of the host hotels for the tournament.   Front desk staff were friendly and fast so check in was a breeze.  The room was great. Had 2 double beds in a separate room and a queen size pull out. Beds were comfortable and linens were above normal hotel quality. Bathroom was big...though it contained the closet which was kinda weird. Towels were over sized and very soft. Small balcony was nice.  Parking was in a structure next to the hotel and we never had a problem. Loved the atrium like interior of the hotel.  The only cons I can think of were ...the elevators were kinda slow. ...the toilet didnt flush right away and you had to hold the handle down a few seconds. ...and the hash browns at the breakfast buffet were extremely dry hahaha Over all this hotel is a very nice one to stay at and I would definitely stay here again if I am ever in Phoenix again.
5,"If youre at all a ""Foodie"" you cant come to Phoenix, or anywhere within 50 miles and not visit Matts Big Breakfast.  The wait outside is just part of the ambiance and culture of this tiny little place.  I hope they dont very enlarge this place....it would so spoil it. Food....have anything.  Its all cooked to perfection with love and kindness from a kitchen staff that really cares about freshness.  My personal favs are the Waffle and Bacon and the multi grain toast with the fresh jam typically made locally....changes frequently.  This was on Diner, Drive-ins and Dives a few years ago and its still the same bustling place as when Guy was there. Side note...this was way cool.  On our last visit there were 4 of us, and if youve been here you know there are only a couple of tables that seat 4.  So were waiting outside when the server comes out hands us menus, takes our orders.  When were seated about 15 min. later our food was delivered within minutes of being seated.  Helped us get in and out and helped them move a table.  Much appreciated service."
4,"modified is a great place to see a show.  it almost reminds me of basement shows back home- intimate, smelly, people utterly engrossed in the music, all ages.  its good stuff."
5,"I grew up in Arizona and we went to Wongs every Sunday after church.  Three years ago we got stationed in Hawaii.  Everytime I come home, our first stop is Wongs.  I love everything about it.  Wongs is my comfort food."
3,"Service here sucks.  Our ""waitress"" took forever to get our food, and then didnt bring utensils, plates or napkins.  I had to keep going up to the bar to get a drink.  Several times I waited too long.  One time I went up there and there was no one working there.  I should have just put on an apron and walked behind the bar myself and made my own drink.  Still, they have an awesome set up outside for enjoying the warm Phoenix nights.  I dont understand why the band has to play inside.  I guess people who live nearby complained about the noise.  Then dont live next to a f*cking bar!!! Idiots."
4,"I cant dance..yes I can!  Well tonight the hubby and I took our first dance lesson and what a hoot!  Had a blast.  The instructors approach was clear and easy to follow.  She did a great job at blending focus on the instruction with keeping it fun and upbeat.  The facility is pleasant, immaculate and huge - and available to students for practice at any time, not just during their lessons. As mentioned in a previous review, they have a great deal for first time students.  The best thing for couples is that the price per lesson is the same whether for a single or a couple.   Because Ive only done one lesson, and my first dance lesson every (well since high school, but the dinosaurs because extinct since then),  Im looking forward to more lessons and the opportunity to add a star."
4,"Their rolls are super inventive....and they stay open later than most Sushi Places in the Valley (2am).   Their Happy Hour is insane! Ex: 99 cent beers on Tuesday! Ive never had a disappointing meal here, and I am pretty hard to please when it comes to sushi. Recommendations: Signature Roll Squid Salad Yellowtail Collarbone Drinks, Drinks...drinks. They have a little karaoke room, and full bar you can make use of as well. 1 Thing: When its busy, be prepared to order everything at once...or you will be waiting."
1,"If you are over 24 you are too old to be here.   First, this place has beer.  Dont order mixed drinks, dont order wine, both are gross unless your sole purpose is to get trashed, which is the mission of every underage and young, young 20-something at this bar. This is the place youd go to with your fake ID because when youre 19 this is what you think a bar should be. Expect people over drinking and throwing up very early on in the evening in the bathroom."
4,Not your typical deli meat-this is the real deal with the shredded turkey.  Very good.
5,"Changing Hands is the perfect bookstore. These types of places just dont seem to exist, but Changing Hands has managed to survive. Allow me to begin by saying that this bookstore does not have anywhere near the selection of a Barnes and Noble (or probably a Borders, but I dont go into that garbage store and cannot be sure). With that said, there are a few reasons to shop here. First, and most importantly, they have well priced used books. I believe most of their used books are $7.50. They are also all in pristine condition. Now, $7.50 used isnt always that great for a paperback. You can do better online quite often. Whats notable, however, is that their hardcovers are typically $7.50 as well. This is a fantastic price and is hard to beat. Second, the location of CH is perfect. This is one of the best plazas out there. Wildflower, Trader Joes, Macs, Jamba Juice--you cant go wrong. Third, and finally, Changing Hands is a local store, and many good things come with that. The staff is extremely friendly. From what I can tell, they are all hardcore book nerds and you have to love that. The store also has a very welcoming feel to it. Once youre in, you will realize how extremely friendly everyone is. No, not just the staff--the customers. Everyone is talkative, friendly, and just seems to be happy. They are all indulging in one of their hobbies in one of the most inviting stores I have ever seen. Someone will ask the staff ""who wrote such and such?"". The staff will almost assuredly spot a regular and ask him or her  ""who wrote such and such"". If he doesnt know, someone else will  probably pipe up. Its this type of thing that makes it a great store. Overall, it just has a great atmosphere. The only negative comment I can make about Changing Hands is how hippy it is. Theres a ton of books on spiritual techniques, new age methods, buddhism, and whatever the hell else hippies/hipsters think makes them look more cultured. Of course, this just goes along with the Tempe, Trader Joes, and book reading demographic, so I cant blame them for meeting the inherent demand."
3,"The last three times I have been here, the hostesses have been so incredibly rude I have to update and ding them a star. The last time was the last straw and we just left turned around and left. Yes, you work at a popular property. That does not entitle you to be rude and nasty. Its weird as it seems to limited just to the front of the house. The waitstaff is usually great, food is great, and cocktails are top notch. Whoever is running this place, its time for a sit down with your girls in the front."
4,"Always drop by this place when im in tempe.  Usually i do not like greek/mediterranean food, but this place is the exception.  They give you pretty large servings of food when you order the dinners.  I always get the lamb and beef plate.  Comes with bread, meat, vegetables and some white cream sauce.  All in all an excellent combination.  Throw in the low prices and you got yourself a winner."
5,We loved this place.
5,We started each morning of our vacation at The Breakfast Club.  Everything was so tasty; juices are fresh-squeezed.  Menu has quite a variety and portions are very filling  It gets busy early.  Be sure to give it a try.
3,No bad for a chain.
4,"Oh.  Mah.  Gawd. Let me get this out of the way.. the ONLY reason Im dumping a star on Americas Taco Shop is because they charge extra for chips and salsa.  I HATE that.  Charge me if I ask for extra salsa or something, but otherwise, come on.   Now.  Said chips?  Perfect.  Salsa?  Perfecter.  My taco?  Made me cry a little bit.  I am picky about corn tortillas, but these were brilliant. Go to Americas Taco Shop.  I will see you there."
5,"These guys helped me out with my rear windshield wiper.  They could have just shrugged their shoulders and said they didnt have the part, but they worked with me and tried a couple of different options until we found a solution.  Everyone I encountered was great."
5,"Dr. Ken Danyluk and his team offer an Extraordinary Orthodontic experience.  Team Orthodonitcs offers many Orthodontic soluitions for all ages.  Whether patients choose traditional braces, Invisalign or ""Hidden Brace"" lingual braces behind their teeth, they always leave happy!"
3,"I stumbled upon this Fridays while walking around Phoenix on a Sunday afternoon.  I wanted to just go up and have a drink and then take some pictures of the empty baseball field.  Phoenix was completely empty! When I got closer to Chase Field there were some more people and I realized that there was a game going on!  I didnt think I would be able to get into Fridays because of the game; however, it wasnt very busy!  I sat at the bar since I was by myself.  But once I was there awhile, I noticed there were still tables open looking out into the ballpark.  So basically you get to watch the game for free as long as you are ordering stuff.  I thought that was pretty cool. As for the food/drink... I ordered a daiquiri when I sat down.  It was pretty bad.  Almost too slushy.  I looked through the menu and asked if they had any smaller portions or lunch portion.  I was told that since it was a game day they have a different menu and everything is larger.  So I didnt order any food. The service was good.  The waiter was nice and another waitress named Kimmy even came up and talked to me for a little while.  Id definitely come here again just for the view."
5,"Beautiful parish, also home to the amazing Legacy Ballroom that is available for wedding receptions and events.  The annual Middle East food festival is a wonderful family event with fantastic food, pastry, and entertainment!"
5,"Today our travels took us to the Chandler Mall on 10/31/2012. Therefore we were near to Abuelos for lunch. Nothing like returning to a Restaurant that you found to be very good! We arrived after 1PM, so we were seated ASAP. We ordered drinks first along with a serving of Guacamole. Nice way to start off lunch! My wife ordered the Dilla Lunch while I ordered the Grande Burrito Lunch special. Both item arrived on a very hot plate-wonderful! Whenever we are dining at another Restaurant, a hot plate is always expected but all too often the hot plate fails to appear. Our lunch stay hot until the last bite due to the hot plate service. Everything was great with the meal and no requested drink refills-always a sign of great service! Both restrooms were very clean and serviced many times during the day. We highly recommend Abuelos for a great lunch or dinner!"
5,"If I could give it more than 5, I would.  Sweet Pea and I live down the street, literally DOWN THE STREET, from this bar.  We waited for it to open for what seemed like decades, praying that this was going to be the type of place that could become our local.  It has exceeded our expectations.  The atmosphere is amazing.  The drinks are amazing- every last one of them- but the margaritas are the best Ive ever had.  They tasted like a fresh squeeze of sunshine that makes me happy inside.  Margarita Mondays- $4 margs AND free food?  Happy hours are amazing.  New Years Eve last year was amazing.  The 1 year anniversary party was amazing.  But most of all, the owner and staff are some of the coolest peeps that youll ever meet.  Go here.  You will love it."
5,"Thank you Sunflower for having a decent selection of tofu and fake meats so I dont have to drive 25 minutes to Whole Foods. Also I would like to tell you that I really enjoy your produce prices and your friendly staff, especially the cashiers, they are always so pleasant and helpful. While I am at it I should probably apologize for ""sampling"" lots of your candy from the bulk item bins, those chocolate covered peanut butter filled pretzels are amazing, I promise I always use the scoop. And one more thing, its really awesome that you carry beers brewed by Rinkukiu Alaus Darykla, the Lobster Lover is DELICIOUS!"
5,"Consistent with the east coast stores, great flavor selection, friendly and accommodating staff.   The regular size doesnt look big but it is plenty for the price, not to mention the staff consistently fills above the top the cup on all products.   A much better value than Cold Stone, Baskin Robbins, and self serve froyo."
4,"Sadly received this email today: Sabatinos is Closed You know we have been experiencing a lack of sales which we can blame on the economy, new restaurants opening here in the valley (most likely for much less cost than us original places), we tried to work with our landlord, but he would not budge on lowering our rent. We just could not afford the 5500.00 this month and were afraid we would lose everything in our place to a Lockout, which was threatened to us already. We just wanted to say goodbye to all of our loyal customers, we really enjoyed having you come in weekly and keeping up with your lives as well as you keeping up with ours. We will probably be leaving the Az area and starting over fresh.   God Bless   Kevin and Sheri"
4,"Sweet Potato Tater Tots..................why are you still reading?  what more needs to be said?  Yum Yum getcha some! The only thing keeping them from 5 stars is their unwillingness to enforce rules with parents who bring kids and think everybody else wants to enjoy watching them run around the place like its a playground, its NOT - keep your kids at the table or at home."
5,"OK, being from Wisconsin (the land of the ""great lakes"") I was COMPLETELY surprised to be told that, yes, there are lakes here in the desert of Arizona.  The Lake, Saguaro Lake, is a man made lake originally built as Stewart Mountain Dam...even so, its beauty is equal to those you would see in the glacier regions of the Midwest.  I was amazed, frankly, at how beautiful this tour was.  Sold for $18 for 90 minutes, you get your moneys worth.  But that is probably not what you want to hear... The ""event"" is a combination of 1) the scenery, and also 2) the charm of the paddle boat itself.  The boat is quite large with seating for probably close to 75 people!  Its an event that you could share with family, but I happened to be there with friends.  Currently, its a pretty mellow type of event (great for Mothers Day!), although I am told that they are hoping to exploit its benefits to include comedy shows, Jazz ensembles, stargazing, and a variety of other events. P.S.  They also advertise that you can rent the paddle boat for company picnics, weddings, and the like."
4,"There are bunch of different tours. I went on the hour long one (probably the cheapest one as well) where I didnt see the bedrooms or inside of the house. It was very hot coming here on a summer day - I do NOT recommend it. They do provide you with water and a red umbrella though.  I learned a lot about architecture from the tour and why certain things were done. I would recommend coming here during the fall seasons because they mentioned you can see the tents out there.  So quick summary - basically, Frank Lloyd Wright would live at this place during the winter months when it was warm in Arizona but super cold where hes from. He didnt come here during the summer months - way too hot!"
4,"Im rating this place as a Music Venue and Bar, not as a restaurant.  UBs seems to be hosting a slew of Metal shows over the next 3 months, which is good to see a place open its arms and bar to the metal community.  As far a heavy metal venue goes, its run of the mill. It has enough room to either mosh or sit in the booths along the back wall.  As far as the bar, the prices seemed slightly on the high side, especially for the ""dive-ness"" this place exhibits.  Their beer menu had 4 or 5 typos on it, just something to chuckle at, such as Rolling Rook beer, ODools, and listed Fat Tire as an import. (Cuz Colorado is SO FAR way).  Luckily, beer and metal go together, so people tend to pay.  The old man in the Bolo tie checking IDs was definitely a good sport."
3,"Good vibe - and outstanding location - they definitely work well with a large group (10), delivering orders to the right person without asking ""who gets ...""  LOVE THAT KIND OF SERVICE.  And not once, NOT ONCE, did the service people call any of our group ""guys"" (okay, okay, a pet peeve of mine).  Horseradish potatoes are a bit salty -- and prime rib serving is definitely less than generous.  That said -- the fish and chips were great, as were (according to one of our party) the pork and beans.  Desserts are HUGE -- share with 2 or 3 others."
4,"My husbands former employer said when we get to Phoenix we must go to In-N-Out. He said the last time he had one there was a line out the door. Not much of a beef burger person, we stumbled upon this burger joint as we left Ikea and decided to try it. The emergency granola bar I keep in my purse wasnt working. There was no line out the door, who wants to wait in line anyway. We both ordered a cheeseburger (no tomato, no special sauce, no ketchup for me). It arrived in a card board container which was kinda cute and everything was hot and fresh. My burger has a thick slice of onion and several crispy lettuce leaves. The burger itself was just okay, but the freshness of the toppings won me over. My husbands had a big slice of tomato.  Did In-N-Out live up to the hype from his former employer? Not exactly, but it came pretty close."
4,"I have just relocated to Scottsdale and eager to find a great wine bar and/or restaurant with a great wine list...and 5th and Wine was the one place that everyone recommended, so I was eager to check it out! I decided to check it out one night after work, and asked a few co-workers for some delish food choices to try...the bruschetta was the one to try! I loved the ambiance, very social atmosphere, nice bar scene and small tables, but they also had another room for tables further away from the bar which was more chill and quiet atmosphere.  I was quickly seated at a nice table in the more quiet area, and could scope out the scene.  I started with a delish glass of Charles LaFitte - Brut France sparking...which for $9 was a deal and refreshing! I quickly scanned the menu for the bruschetta and my mouth started to water with the selections.  I opted for the prosciutto/fig/marscapone bruschetta and the standard mozzarella/tomato/basil bruschetta!  Both were totally delicious!  The bread was lightly toasted and a bit soft...not like your typical ""crunchy"" bread bruschetta...which I actually enjoyed more than I thought I would.   I ordered the Beef Bourguignon Julia Childs ""Beef, Wine, Bacon, Mushroom Stew"" over egg noodles...for $16.96...again, a total deal and totally tasty!  The beef melted in my mouth and the mushroom and sauce was hearty and flavorful! All in all, the meal was wonderful, and the service was great - very attentive staff - Jonathan, my waiter, was super personable. I also met Scott Yanni, one of the owners, who came over to see how my meal was...and he was very gracious when I told him that I just relocated here and was very happy to find his restaurant as one of my new favorites! I will definitely be back for more of their great menu and tasty libations!"
4,"This is about a 3.5 star mexican place to me. Ive always had good service but watched other folks get like 1-star service, at a level I might not come back. I like the White Chimichanga here. The Chili Verde is decent, and the Hatch Chilis are nice too, if you havent had those. 4 Stars - White Chimi 3 Stars - Chili Verde 3 Stars - Cheese crips with Hatch chilis Im sure there are better places around but Ive been coming here for several years when in the area, and I definitely enjoy this place. Sometimes they have hot chicks working up front. If you keep up this practice Arriba, Ill five-star you sometime soon!"
3,Pizza crust & toppings are excellent. However the pizza sauce was too salty. Im willing to try again later.
3,"I dont drink, so my review will not be intoxicated by anything except the building.  I gave it two stars for the building.  They did a beautiful job with the remodel (Im a mid-century and Haver fan.)  The food wasnt anything to write home about.  I have to admit that Im particularly tough on restaurants filled with...I dont know what to call them...scenesters, I guess.  Service was ok.  Its not BAD, mind you, its just that I dont get it.  I guess if youre paying with credit cards all the time, you dont care how much mediocre food costs, as long as it makes you feel cool about eating there."
3,I thought this bagel shop was ok. The bagel sandwich I got was relatively lackluster. I think I will stick to Einsteins for the time being.
4,"I met up with a friend for dinner here the other night. Its a little far from me, unfortunately; if this was within a few miles of me, Id be here a -lot-.   For starters, the place is easy to miss. Its a hole in the wall. Its very small inside, only a few tables; definitely consider takeout.    That said, if its not busy, dont be afraid to stay. We ate in; when there was a significant lull in the crowd, the girl behind the counter came both to clear our tables and to deliver a second item I ordered a bit later in the evening. I wish Id been carrying cash, there is a tip jar by the register, and I would have loved to have left something for that.    The food...ah, the food. Great bang for the buck. Have I had better tacos? Yes. Once, handmade by a Mexican immigrant my mother was good friends with, as we joined her for a family dinner. In restaurants? No. This is good Mexican street food, small hand made corn tortillas with flavorful, moist meat on them, and some warm salsa on top. Lovely. They even offer lengua, for those that like it, a very nice touch.    As others have said, the rice is very good; I wasnt actually that fond of the beans though.    Is this place worth going 20 minutes out of your way? Unfortunately, no, hence the 4 star. But is it worth going to if youre already nearby? Yes, very much yes."
1,"I give this review a total 1 star If I was able to, I would have rated no stars at all!.... I would NEVER reccomend ANYONE to live here. The office staff is horrible and made me feel uncomfortable the whole year I lived there based on THEIR MISTAKES! I can not express how disappointed I am with the way that they have treated me....."
5,"Dr Brodkin is one of the greatest doctor out there.  She was voted two years in a row for arizona foothill top doctor and it shows!!!  She is caring, and overall great doctor.  She moved her office last year and wow did she change for the best.  The staff is great her new nurses i love love love....i recommend Dr Brodkin to anyone who need  a GYN...."
5,"My wife and I as well as several of our friends drive from Ahwatukee on a regular basis to dine at Flos on Thompson Peak and Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd. 25 miles isnt too far for this food. Weve been eating here since the 90s and have always been pleased. I discovered it when I worked in the area and used to stand in line for lunch, it was so busy. Our favorites: Lemon Pepper Chicken with extra lemon wedges and the Kung Pow although I cant think of anything I wouldnt order."
5,Great place.  Hard to see behind Carls Jr. on Southern Ave but is Worth finding!
3,"Yelper Jane Bs review is remarkably similar to what I intended to include in my review. Weve stayed at close to a dozen different Homewood Suites over the years and this one left us wishing we could have stayed at any of the others instead. Furnishings were adequate but not terribly comfortable.  The living room had a sleeper sofa and a side chair, a dining table with two chairs, an end table, a coffee table, and a TV stand with 3 drawers plus the kitchenette, all in a room roughly 9 x 14. The bedroom contained a desk with 3 drawers (serving also as the dresser) and the bed and nightstands.  The desk also served as the TV stand, allowing a small work area and taking up so much room the door couldnt swing all the way open. Our bedroom also contained the mystery deadbolted closet with unknown contents, which took up half the guest closet space. The bathroom was large but dingy and dimly lit. I considered renting an on-demand movie one evening, but everything offered by the hotel was $15+/each (!!) and since there wasnt a DVD player we didnt have the opportunity to rent somewhere more reasonable and bring it back to our room.  Free wifi seemed stable although a bit slow, and the pool was small but the kids didnt seem to mind. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was well-prepared and always had enough variety to keep the kids and adults happy. We got a great rate but hey, its Scottsdale in the summer so most rates are pretty darn good.  Normally we enjoy staying away from home, but after 6 nights here even the kids were anxious to get home. Well stay at Homewood Suites again in the future, but not this one."
3,Another place thats walking distance. Subway is one of those places where you cant go wrong....you got 5-dollar value meals or foot longs. The guys are really friendly and arent stingy with the toppings. Im not a big fan of the smell subways have though. Eh anyways its just one of those places where im lazy and dont want to make a sandwich...plus it helps me keep my girlish figure like jared :)
5,"Really good food, fun atmosphere, great experience and totally unique and fun.  I would way rather spend my money at a one of a kind, family owned shop than a cheaper- dime a dozen corporate mcdonalds."
3,"Mulligans is that place in Scottsdale you dont think of going to when youre in the mood for dancing, which is mostly why I go out in Scottsdale at night. But I always find myself there either before or after my dance trips. I totally dig the atmosphere at Mulligans - its chill, unpretentious, and never obnoxiously crowded. The prices are decent and the location is pretty centralized.  The DJ isnt always the best, but when youre with good friends and good drinks, Mulligans makes you feel at home.  Mulligans kind of has that dive bar feel but doesnt make you feel like you might get mugged and stabbed in the eye."
5,"Loooove this place! Yes its pricey, but good sushi usually is. The guys making the rolls were friendly. The atmosphere is nice. Hubby absolutely loved the quail eggs and I couldnt get enough of the spicy shrimp roll. Seriously, try it. You wont be disappointed!"
5,"This, my friends, is THE place to get some very authentic Chinese food.  The servings are HUGE for what youre paying...shucks, they are huge no matter which way you look at it so be careful not to order too much food unless you want leftovers. Who doesnt like leftover Chinese food anyway? My recommendations are the Sweet and Sour chicken, the Egg Foo Yung and the chow mein. You will not be disappointed. Youll also find the soups on the back of the menu at an average of 4 bucks or so. You will be pleasantly surprised when you get the bowl...it can feed at least 6 people. She will bring small bowls out and serve it for you right at the table. Give the hot and sour soup a try. As for the service, it depends on how you look at it. Dont be afraid to get up and refill your own water. Shoot, the waitress is the only one thats there, give her a break already. She must own the joint with her husband because there is always this little kid in the corner playing on his laptop. So, get your own water and your own take home containers if you want. She doesnt have a problem with it. Yes, the place is a little worn but you dont go there to look at pretty stuff. Its not dirty, just broke down. Youd be broke down too if you practically gave away your food in abundance to your customers. Who has money for new furniture if you take care of your customers bellies.  The lobster, crab and fish are fresh and cheap. Try finding lobster somewhere else in the valley for 10 bucks a pound, I dare ya.  So, head on out, just dont go on a Wednesday, thats their day off. They are open 11AM to 11PM every other day though. You can call in your order and pick it up if you dont want to look at the place. Oh yeah, and if you ever go in there and it smells horrid, its not the place, its a popular dish that some customers order called ""Salty Fish"". It stinks to all heck! If that plate comes out I usually pack up my food, giggle and finish my meal at home. I dont mind one bit, thats just the way it is. Oh and the waitress does speak good English, however, you wont find many Caucasians frequenting this place. That means the food is pretty authentic!"
5,"Edens Grill has to be one of my favorite, and newly discovered Middle Eastern/Mediterranean restaurant in the PHX metro. Located in a sleepy strip mall, close to Arties Ace, is EG. My partner and I had the opportunity to have dinner here a few weeks ago and we were totally wowed by everything! We started off with the hummus, followed by two orders of the vegetarian plate. The vegetarian plates were huge and featured dolmades, falafel, rice, veggie skewers and veggie patties (2). The vegetarian plate was massive and everything on the plate was delicious. Next time well pay the extra $5 and split one Vegetarian Plate instead of getting two. The pita and hummus were fresh and delicious, however, I find EGs hummus to be a a little thick for my preference and they use a heavy dose of tahini in their hummus. Overall, I would totally recommend EG to anyone with an itch for Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food but be warned, they arent open for lunch on the weekends yet."
3,"Not bad, I usually leave pretty happy and full."
5,"Wow! Being a Phoenix native, we have enjoyed many a meals at the hands of Chef Gross. But this past weekend I was blown away. I was planning a large garden party for my friends bridal shower. The record temperatures left my garden ravaged by the heat and I did not want to have sweltering ladies unable to enjoy themselves. After a small response to attendance, I decided to see what some of my favorite dining spots could offer me. I had a small budget but wanted to keep it classy. Christophers truly rose to the occasion. Alex, was my special event contact and this lady was ""on it"". Emails and phone calls were returned at lightning speed. She presented a delightful menu with plenty of choices (some even for the vegetarians attending) all with in my price range.  We had a wonderful time. We had a party of 18 in the beautiful private room that fit our festivities perfectly. Sundays can be quiet at The Biltmore Fashion Park so it lend-ed us to a bit of intimacy that was nice. Ben was our go to guy. He was right there for every thing we needed and his helpers were polite and attentive. As for the food, well, its Chris, come on! I had the vegetable risotto ans  it was cooked to perfection. All of the plates came out of the kitchen quickly and all together but no one ever made us feel rushed. Wine flowed, desserts were gobbled up and the ladies oohed and awed over everything. the staff even offered to take gifts to the car for the bride. Thanks for saving me Chef Chris and your team. You were all fabulous and I will be telling all of my friends what a great job you did. The holidays are coming and Ben reminded us that they also do catering! Hmmm, can you say ""Christmas Party""?"
4,"Im not sure how Ive missed trying this place, after over a decade of living in the Valley, partly as an ASU student in need of a good hang-over recovery joint. I cant believe I relied exclusively on the IHOP on Apache Blvd, all those years in Tempe. Dammit! It was packed on the New Years Day morning I came here with a friend. The service was a bit slow but on par with my expectations for a jam-packed popular breakfast joint on New Years Day. I ordered a calorie-laden Cajun skillet with scrambled eggs. Im knocking off a star because the chicken pieces were too dry for my taste. But the rest of the skillet was very good. The service was friendly and professional. Wildcats beware, lots of ASU students within."
5,"By far the best poker room in the state and I have played in every casino poker room in the valley. The action is always there-lots of dead money to be picked up if you know where to look. Good promotions, amazing food served table side and all the sports games you can watch. I wish they would bring back 6-12 limit but 8-16 will have to do =) such an improvement over the tents, though they will always hold a place in my heart. It sucks cause I work right next to the casino and every night after work I have a tough decision..go home to my family or go to my favorite card room and tear it up. If you havent been there-MUST GO."
4,Outside atmosphere was really nice. This was my first time there and I enjoyed it. Our food was great. I had a salad and my friend had the filet which looked excellent. It was more pricey than I expected though.
5,"Doc and Edwards has been a place of refuge for 5 years for me.  Hell, most of my friends spent their 21st birthday there.  It is hard to explain walking into a bar and just feeling at home.  It is so comfortable and wide open.  Even on the most crowded days, I feel like I am on the cast of cheers.  The employees there are good and the food is exactly what you expect.  You can also order silvermine there with no delivery charge!  The pool table rates have gone up in the last few years but if you spend a good amount of money on drinks, they waive the pool table fee. Or you could go for some ping pong, foosball, UFC, or big buck hunting.  It has a great juke box but watch out for the lady that throws 20 in and slangs the worst playlist I have ever heard. If my girl would only let me, I would have my wedding there."
4,"This place is still really new, so theyre still getting the kinks worked out, but it looks great and the film selection is awesome!   I went there the Sunday of their opening weekend to see Metropolis.  It might be a little confusing the first time you go, but you pay for your movie tickets at the bar.  They dont have paper tickets yet, they just gave me and my date little stickers. The theater has 4 or 5 rows of comfy seats and a few tables in the back for people with drinks.  Metropolis was in Blu-Ray and looked amazing.  The showing went off without a hitch.  They even gave us a free bowl of tasty snack mix to eat during the movie.  Im not a drinker so I cant comment on the bar offerings, but I think its great to have a theatre showing rad independent and classic movies downtown.  I really hope this place takes off, I can see myself visiting it often."
3,"3.5 stars! I must say, Im a total fan of their Zipps Golden Wings! Gotta love their reverse happy hour! Ordering their wings on medium is smart move, their wings are already so flavorful and sweet, that its a shame to go any hotter, since youll mask the inherent, crisp, and juicy flavor. Id say pass on the Fish Tacos, and if youre in a burger move, order the Jalapeno Burger. Sampled their beer, not bad!  Breakdown: Zipps Golden Wings ~ a MUST get! Fish Tacos ~ Yawn... Sweet Potato Chips ~ Could do again! Jalapeno Burger ~ Delish!  Overall, this is a chill spot with your better than average bar food!"
4,"My previous review has the real details about what i LOVE about their food! Update:  Doing mostly take-out here, but at least one of the grumpy girls is more friendly now!  Yesterday when I grabbed our to-go order, she smiled, made small conversation, and did not exude a sullen disposition in any way.  Im happy for me, Im happy for her! Ordered many of our usual items, plus Mongolian beef, which was very tasty. Im stil partial to the Ginger beef, however."
5,"Mostly I love the Rokerij just because I love saying the name.   But the food is also killer.  I had the most amazing chicken, and the sides, which usually I just take for granted as filler food, were sodelicious that they caught my attention in a big way.  I also tried my dates steak, and while it was fairly spendy, it sure seemed worth it. The feel of the place is great too, with the dark stone walls and coziness without feeling too crowded.  We ventured downstairs to look at the bar, and had we been there early enough to snag a couch I wouldnt have wanted to leave. It definitely feels like a splurge, or somewhere youd take a business associate or date that you wanted to wow.  Its manages a high end feel, while remaining unmistakably local.  I cant say Id suggest it just for any old night, but it will stay on top of my list for special occasions."
2,"I really liked Joes; the food and service was always good. But one bad experience has me wondering if I will ever return. The problem I had was with the service. We walked in on a weekday around 11, the place was pretty packed and there was only one server on the floor. We grabbed a table and waited about 10 minutes before she came over with water. We told her were ready to order, to which she replied ""I am really busy and have other people who need to order ahead of you."" In my 16 years as a chef, I have never heard a server say that. She didnt even offer to bring us coffee or anything. If anyone from Joes is reading this, heres a little crash course in restaurant 101...if a customer says theyre ready to order, TAKE THEIR DAMN ORDER! Anyway, we ended up walking out. Guess well be eating exclusively at Matts Big Breakfast from now on."
4,"My review is based on Terminal 3, Delta!  Getting checked in at Delta was quick, security line was quick, and returning picking up my bags was quick too!  The signs are easy to read and easy to understand.  I was in Nassau, Bahamas airport, the signs pointed everywhere!  Crazy!!"
4,"Perfect for a Quick lunch. And I mean seriously quick. Like ninja light speed fast.  Under two minutes consistently from order to table. How can you beat that! One time they clock-in at 1min 45sec for a table of five.  My favorites are the House Special Chicken, the Orange chicken and the Prawns. cant go wrong and you will leave stuffed and satisfied."
5,I really enjoyed my mani/pedi with Trisha!  She took her time and taught me about manicuring my nails from home which I loved. I went in for the Groupon basic mani/pedi deal and left feeling like I got a lot more! It was the most pleasant experience Ive had at a nail salon. The conversation was easy and Trish is a great person. I will be coming back to Trish for nails again!  The entire staff was friendly and professional. Great Salon!!
4,"Fantastic, order anything off the menu and you will be pleasantly surprised.  Best gyro Ive ever had hands down and the falafel is equally amazing.  Owner paid special attention to my boyfriend and I and made sure we were happy with everything.  Only downside is that they close for a couple hours during the day before dinner time (I believe its 2:30 to 5:30 or something like that) so I cant eat their delicious food whenever I want, haha, keep on doing what youre doing Sahara."
4,"Time flies when youre having fun... Its been almost a full year since my initial review of Bacon, and Ive been back probably ten times or more. Ive seen a lot of transition with the employees but I can say that their service has gotten much better since the beginning.  The casual atmosphere is right up my alley for a weekend breakfast, and my yogi omelette / protein pancake orders have stayed consistent too.   I was there earlier today and while the service was spot-on, I did find a piece of ham in my otherwise veggie omelette - but I overlooked it and enjoyed my meal nonetheless... My husband has been to Bacon even more than i have, and he told me he recently sampled whats to come on their new lunch menu (think pastrami sandwich).  So, go for breakfast, go for lunch, go for a Bloody Mary or a Mimosa... just kick back and enjoy your meal!"
2,"Let me start by saying I have never had BBQ I didnt like. Ive had BBQ I could do without, but never that I didnt like. Went in for lunch today and I was the only customer, so I figured cool I will get good service no matter what. The girl sat me and was very pleasant and indicated my waitress would be right over. About ten minutes later, watching the waitress talk on a personal phone call at the bar the whole time, the girl who sat me came over to take the order. She walked up, didnt say a word, and just stared at me. Ok I can live with that it was only a minor inconviencence.  Got the #4 lunch chopped pork sandwich with beans and a lemonade and it came out very quickly. Possibly because the beans were Bushs or the like? They tasted like canned baked beans heated up in a microwave. Not cool. The sandwich was ok at best. Thinking back on Stacys, Honey Bears, and other great BBQ spots, this one was not even in the same arena. Ill have to go back though and try a sandwich with the correct sauce on it. There was one sauce on the table which after reading reviews here I had assumed was the BBQ sauce. It looked a little watery but I thought whatever its NC style, and it may have been because it was a bit vinegary. On the way out I noticed every other table had a red sauce labeled BBQ, so I guess they have two different ones. I would have preferred the red one I assume.  There was no atmosphere, the place was run down (doesnt appear to have been remodeled after Shish Kabob House vacated) and was generally a dirty feeling place. Seeing as they didnt have any customers at lunch time, Im assuming the place is going to lose money today. Dont know about other days, but they better get their act together quick or it is going to fail."
5,"Total wine totally takes a crap on Bev Mo. This store has everything! The employees are also very knowledgeable. The other day we went in and my husband insisted I try red wine instead of sticking to my usual Riesling (I dont like change). So we asked one of the employees and he asked me a few questions then suggested a bottle of Malbec. The Malbec tasted amazing! I was so happy. For those of you who dont know, its not only wine! You can find everything else. Total wine has helped us stock our bar and entertain our guests. Also, dont forget to chill your bottles before you leave!"
4,I love this place.Their italian beef with hot peppers is a must. I have also tried their sausage and pep sandwich which is just as good.Their prices are as good as you can get. So if youre hungry stop in & get full!!
2,This Baja Fresh really didnt impress me.  Its pricey considering that all youre getting is meat in a tortilla.  It doesnt have that Mexican feel to it and is unoriginal.  There were bugs on the wall.  The food is good however.  Nothing special though.  Since its a corporate chain you cant expect sizzling flavor but I was left unsatisfied.  There are better Mexican food places to go to.
4,"This is a standard place to celebrate Birthdays. The drinks are delicious especially the kiwi and acai specialty drinks. The rolls are over $10, but they are unique and tasty. The environment is very cool and the location is great. Parking is bad just like everywhere in Scottsdale, you need to park in the street. Location is great because you can grab dinner here and then go out after. There is also karaoke available if you want to rent a room for a special occasion."
3,"Moved here from San Francisco, and have been searching  for decent Chinese food.  Flos has been our standby, but we tried Jade Palace on recommendations of our midwestern snowbird friends. I can only comment on the food, as we ordered take out.  Our order was ready in 15 minutes and it was complete.   I had Chow Fun, and it was the equivalent to Flos, Ok, but not spectacular, and a lot more oily.  Husband had Mongolian Beef and said that Flos was better, but the meat tasted fresher on the Jade Palace version.  Jade Palace is much closer to us, so I will try their Hot and Sour soup in the fall, which is usually the barometer I use to measure Chinese Food.  Go figure, we are now hoping for some San Francisco restaurants to relocate to Scottsdale."
2,"Still not in love with it. Again with the overstaffing and employees huddled, eating/drinking and chatting instead of hurrying up and making my drink.  it is okay to hurry--or is that just my strange, city-thinking? meh."
1,"This place used to be amazing.  My favorite memories of past years is going to this seafood place with my parents.  Its not the same anymore. We went for my wifes 30th birthday.  My dad decided to join us.  My wife ordered steak and shrimp, my dad ordered steak, I ordered a crab stuffed lobster.  I have had the crab stuffed lobster many times before.  I was craving it. We got our appetizers.  Dad got snails, wife and I shared steamers.  My dad was happy with the snails.  But then again, how can you go wrong with snails doused in garlic and butter?  The steamers were steamed little neck clams in a garlic broth.  It was not long neck clams like the rest of the world calls steamers.  I wasnt about to argue with the server that these are the wrong clams. The food came and for the first time in my life I was asking the server to take back my meal before I even tried it.  It looked dry and over cooked.  I told the server Ive had this dish many times before and this is not the way its supposed to be.  He told me this is what its supposed to look like and begged me to try it.  I took one bite and I couldnt even swallow it because it was so dry.  Of course the server was gone by this point and didnt come back for 10 minutes to ask me how it was. While I was waiting for the server to return, I told my family I was just going to get the steak.  They just shook their head and told me not to.  I took one bite of my dads steak and spat it out.  How do you screw up steak this bad?  It tasted like beef jerky and butter.  My dad and wife would have complained too, but its my wifes birthday and I am already stealing her thunder.  I swapped my meal out for a steamed lobster.  How do you screw up a steamed 1 1/2 lobster?  Fortunately, that came out fine. So we left hungry and $300 poorer.  I used to not mind paying the money they charged but now, it is not worth it.  I am really hoping people stop coming here so they can just close down."
4,"Ive never been to the former restaurant that was once housed in this quaint little building, so my first impressions may be a bit different from others.  I have always adored this house.  Its absolutely adorable and in such a good location.  I read over the weekend that the new restaurant here was opening, so we made a point to visit it sooner rather than later. We chose to go right after work, so there were only a few other people in here.  I really like the setup with the bar in its own little alcove and seating situated throughout the rest of the house.  We were greeted immediately after walking in and we sat in a table by the window.  While we perused the menus I couldnt help but tap my feet to the killer old school music they were rockin.  I ended up deciding on the grilled cheese to eat. The food was very good.  The sourdough bread was super toasty, literally grilled to perfection.  There was a ton of cheese in the sandwich, but I dont remember which kinds.  The important thing is that it was really tasty.  My only complaint is that the cheese wasnt ooey gooey.  it was melty, but I could still make out the shape of the cheese.  In my book of grilled cheese greatness, it needs to be a little messier.  The sandwich was also served with a side of chips or salad if you choose.  The chips were good and I ate them all up.  There was also a dill pickle, but I dont do dill pickles. I definitely think that this is a killer new spot that will do very well.  I have no doubt that this ultra-hip but non-pretentious spot will quickly become a neighborhood favorite."
5,"This place is so unique! I was disappointed that it was closed the weekend of my birthday in July, but I wont hold that against them! This bar/boxing ring/vintage store/food truck/soda fountain is super awesome! My cousin took me here a few years ago and since then its been a place that I always show friends and family members when they want to go out downtown. The drink list is pretty extensive, with lots of organic cocktails served in cute mason jars. You definitely get a good sized drink! The beers are cheap, the food is so-so. I think its a bit overpriced, so Id recommend eating somewhere else beforehand.  The boxing ring is random, but Ive seen friends go up there and fight in a drunken stupor, and that is a sight Ill never regret seeing. Some nights they have karaoke, which Ive chosen to partake in a few times. Ive seen DJs there on the weekends, and I really like how they switch up the music genre each time. Sometimes its rap, others rockabilly and oldies. On Tuesday nights they do FREE swing dancing lessons and Ive been really wanting to try that! i love the vintage feel to the place and am surprised its not packed all the time!"
5,"This is the best restaurant chain EVER!!!!  I love EVERYTHING there and the service has always been A+.  The fried zucchini strips (appetizer) are the best in the world, the Caesar salad is the best I ever had, even their croutons on the salad are better than any!!!  Olive oil herb dip is Fabulous, the warm bread is like no other.  Most of the dinners that I have tried have been excellent but the Chicken Bryan is magnificent.  Waiters and manager the best."
3,"I love to eat here, however it is hit or miss. Sometimes we get good service and other times we dont. Sometimes the food is really good, but other times its off. Our order is usually messed up, but they are good about fixing it. One thing I have a problem with is using coupons here, I had a coupon for a pizza and also ordered an appetizer at happy hour half off. They did not want to combine the two offers but the coupon didnt say say anything about that.  When the food is good though its really good, which is why we return."
5,"They have a limited time thing going on right now with BBQ chicken pizza (not sure how long its going to last) but let me just say it was amazing.  Probably THE best BBQ Chicken pizza I have ever had.  I have tried other things too, like the tomato basil soup, and many of their sandwiches ... very good, very fresh - every time.   The 5 stars is for the pizza, but if I were to rate Jasons Deli over all they would get about a 4."
4,No matter what I order I know it will be tasty. Maizies have a lot to choose from which can be a little overwhelming for me. I love their wait staff everyone is always friendly. When I am in Maizies I feel like I am in a neighborhood hang out.
1,"I was so, so hopeful.  October in Scottsdale, yummy, tacos.....Wow!  Rip Off!! $10 Just to get in (what was that for?). No shade unless you were buying a drink.  Most places wouldnt give you salsa or taco sauce with your measly over priced taco. They seemed like the vultures who didnt care about the customer, just the $2 ticket they could grab from you.   I had to beg for a napkin then hunt for a place to sit feeling watched by the other vultures waiting for me to get up. I was ready to leave after 45 minutes and my Pepsi had gotten warm, so I had gotten a cup of ice from the bar.   I poured it in, took one drink and as I was leaving to hike back to my car, security stopped me and would nt let me take it out! ""It could have booze in it"".  Well, by then, I was one angry little local. Dumped it all in trash and said to my sweet daughter in law who was about to ""go mad"" with me, ""Get me outta here!"". She had brought her 2 year old, thinking what a fun way to spend a Saturday morning and encourage our local businesses.  Nope.  Not good."
1,Wow?!  Is this the new Barcelona?!  Yuck!  Old scuzy men and middle aged women with fake boobs that are falling out of their painted on dresses.  All bars were completely under staffed on a Friday night.  We waited 7 minutes at the front bar until being ignored continuously and we became so frustrated that we made our way to the round bar and it seemed just as understaffed.  Whats the point of only having a few bartenders on probably the busiest night of the week for bar-goers?  We even approached the blond manager to ask for service and she was completely rude and had a total lack of desire to help us.  We will NOT return due to the lack of service and efficiency.  This place has GOT to staff more bartenders and needs much more help.  Welcome to North Scottsdale Barcelona.
2,"Abridged:  Im gonna be real with you. I am not in love with Pizzeria Bianco, and had I actually had to wait in line, this rating would probably be lower. My group was lucky enough to receive the last table without any wait. Maybe it was the fact that its hard to impress me with pizza. Maybe it was a fluke that wont happen again. At least thats what everyone keeps telling me. But honestly, I just wasnt that impressed with the $19 pizza I received. Sadly, the leftovers I took home ended up being tossed because I was afraid to try it again.  Ive been worried about writing this for awhile (its been sitting here unfinished for nearly a year), but in the end, my opinions havent changed, and I sit here, still scared to return. If someone dragged me there again, or had a party there or something, Id probably give it another shot, as I hate to write off any place after a single trip, but I honestly felt just eh about the whole thing. Thankfully none of my visiting out of town guests have cried for me to take them there."
5,"Rivas helped me get through numerous late night study sessions and early morning hangovers!  Hard to go wrong with anything on the menu, but my two faves are the Carne Asada and Chile Rellano burritos...with fresh horchata, of course!"
4,"Recently a friend at the gallery was very excited because it was Dollar taco night a Chicos.  That is fine if you have any idea of where it is.  Turns out I had been by there more then a few times when I went to the Safeway and Subway at 7th st and McDowell.  Its a little place in a very small strip center.  Its very much a neighborhood place,  clean with an upbeat atmosphere and a few tables outside.  Thats about all I can say about the setting. I was surprised by the variety of meats that one can get on the tacos.  The tacos arent  to exciting but on the whole are fresh and have a good flavor better than I would have expected.  That is all I had but from what I saw of the meals around me, hey looked pretty good as a whole. I will go back to Chicos.  It definitely has fare that is better than the local fast food in the same price range.  Not an exciting place but pleasant to think of returning to.  I went there after a very long day so that is saying something.  Just the enjoyment of quite of the few people just sitting down and having a good time rubbed of on me.  I needed it!"
4,It was pretty good. But I dont know much about Indian food. It was better than the only other place Ive been too which had dirty grey chicken in its dishes. Taste was good.
5,I am a Regus member and could get wait here since I could use my membership card. Its a great place situated on 3rd floor with awesome city view.  Complimentary menu is refreshing. Cordial staff. Quiet and relaxed environment. Many TV screens and seatings to get comfortable with.
5,"2nd time I went to Grazie and both times it was excellent. The service is fast and attentive and the food great. The portions are huge so there is no problem to share the starter or the thin crust, wood-fired pizza ... So far I had the Dame Edna and the Roma pizza and both were very tasty. The wine collection is great and has some very interesting stuff which includes also less expensive wines. Havent made it to the desert menu yet as both times there was no space left ..."
5,"I am one step closer to completing my goal.  I want to visit every Grimaldis in the US before I die.  After tonights visit to this one, I have most of AZ taken care of. We decided to come here because we had never been to this one.  We arrived and were seated right away.  Surprisingly this one wasnt crowded at all and that was fine by us.   We got a small caesar salad, a small pepperoni and garlic, and a personal white pizza with roasted red peppers.  A few minutes later we got our salad.  It was really good.  Just enough dressing, lots of cheese and croutons.  It was a good starter.  A few minutes after that, our pizza came out.  If you have read my other reviews, you will know that I think Grimaldis is the best.....this pizza was no different.  I really liked the white with roasted red peppers.  Everything was delicious and even though there was some doubt we could finish off 2 pizzas, I turned on my inner fat boy, and finished off all the pizza.  It was tough, but someone had to do it....little kids are starving in Africa somewhere....lll be damned if Im going to waste some slices of this amazing pizza.  Down the hatch it went....my stomach doesnt like me right now because its so full, but he will forgive me once he doesnt get any of this delicatessen back in San Diego LOL."
3,"Mi Patio is a solid 3 star restaurant. Some days the food tastes better than others. And some days the entertainment value is better than others. But its not a chain, its within walking distance and has very affordable margaritas. Theres no bike rack (ugh) and the taquitos are basically a carne asada taco with no toppings (which I happen to like)."
4,"This place is great to go to for a chill and low key atmosphere. You can play billiards, cornhole, or video blackjack.  One thing I didnt like: one of the bartenders told me there is a $10 minimum to use my credit card and I think he was trying to hustle me because when I went back to close my tab (without buying another drink), the other bartender took my credit card. Otherwise, a nice chill place to go."
4,"Before a Suns game recently, my Family and I stopped into Blue Hound for some drinks and appetizers.  We attempted to go to Arrogant Butcher (been there many times), but it was packed.  Having heard good things from another family member, we decided to give Blue Hound a try, and Im glad we did.  The inside decor is trendy and simple.  We sat at the couch by the door (since that was what was available) and were quite comfortable - except for the occasional draft from the door.  Our waitress was ok, she wasnt entirely too friendly, but she took care of our needs. As for the food, we ordered pretty much all the appetizers.  The biggest highlight was the scones with bacon jam.  In fact, it was so good, its inspired me to make these two things at home to see if I can replicate it.  We also had the popcorn, which was good and the sliders, which were alright.  The pizza with duck was great (could have been crisper) as was the other items we had. Based on the previous reviews it seems this place, being new, might be hit or miss.  Id say give it a try if youre in the area... why not?  Trust me, its worth a visit for the cheddar scallion scones with bacon jam!"
3,"For cheap pizza, its as good as it gets. More selection than the other cheap pizza places, and the quality is way better.  The wings are delicious also, especially the Cajun flavor!!! If your looking for something like one of the big chains, then go there, but this is good for the money. If you want gourmet pizza, then go pay for it, dont look for it at the bargain places.  I paid $29 for an XL pizza with two toppings and 20 wings, and everyone was happy!  Just know that its really fast pizza, but its better than the other big guys!"
4,"Very consistent, thin crust pizza, made with fresh ingredients and excellent cheese! The market place is lively and the atmosphere is festive!"
3,"Its refreshing to find one-of-a-kind places -- God knows Phoenix needs more of them to inject personality into this generic, strip-mall, chains-on-every-corner valley. Finding this unique sandwich shop, which is in a house that has been transformed into a restaurant, is indeed a welcome find. The real estate is limited, so parking is compact and circles around the back of the building. The dining area is mainly indoors, but there is also a small patio facing the back portion of the parking lot, which is not very scenic. Inside there is art on the wall that can be purchased. They serve wraps, bowls and salads. The food has been pretty good, although it did not knock my socks off. I ordered the Baja Bowl, which is described on their online menu as ""Southwestern chicken atop garlic rice, black beans, Monterey jack cheese and topped with lime sour cream and pico de gallo."" It was OK, but the chicken was dry and cut in fairly large chunks. It could have possibly been microwaved -- not sure, but there were no southwest flavors to speak of. I have done a better job of cooking chicken on my George Foreman grill at home. Perhaps the garlic rice would have helped with the flavor, but I had substituted the rice with organic brown rice which did little to add flavor. Sour cream was not ""lime"". There was a small slice of lime served on the edge of the bowl. I would not bother ordering this again -- especially if I have a craving for some southwest food. On another recent visit I ordered a wrap called ""Prince of Thais - Spicy peanut chicken with baby spinach, garlic rice, fresh ginger slaw, cucumber pico and red onion wrapped in a spinach tortilla."" That had better flavor than the baja bowl. Vegetable ingredients were fresh and good. Again, I was not very impressed with the chicken chunks. One thing I think Thats A Wrap needs to address is the use of styrafoam cups. Afterall their slogan is ""Healthy Food for a Hungry Planet"" and they have a link for a new restaurant ""Green"" for Vegan food on their website. For such an artsy, earthy place, I would have thought Thats A Wrap would have made more conscious, earth-friendly choices. For that reason and the bland chicken, I give them an average rating only."
5,"Ritas Kitchen is a hidden gem located right smack in the center of the Camelback Inn. While this may be a hot-spot for hotel guests, I think that locals might be missing out on its charm.  I am a huge fan of anything the Camelback Inn does, especially since they offer live music and a great space for relaxation and Ritas Kitchen is no exception. This restaurant is airy and opens up to the spacious Camelback Inn patio where they play live music every night.  Breakfast:  Breakfast at Ritas is sublime and pretty reasonably priced. They offer a breakfast buffet for around $23 which includes eggs made to order (including omelets), pancakes, waffles, pastries, fresh fruit, bacon, sausage and hashbrowns. Its a great pick for a leisurely weekend breakfast. Just today was Mothers Day and while we only did the breakfast buffet, I did catch a glimpse of the Mothers Day brunch and holy moly do they know how to wow a crowd! Not only did they have stations set up all throughout the restaurant, patio and R-Bar, but they also had an extensive dessert area with build-your-own sundaes, freshly made cotton candy (in an old fashioned cotton candy maker) and a long dessert table with a chocolate fountain.  Lunch: Lunch here is sublime and I also enjoy either the tacos or the chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich is particularly a favorite of mine due to the cheese and sauce. The fries are tasty as well and you can either get sweet potato or regular. I also get sweet potato then regret not just getting the regular which are better in my mind. If the weather permits, sit on the patio and enjoy the beautiful water fountains, views of the mountain and tropical/desert setting."
1,"My husband and I heard great reviews about this restaurant and we decided to give them a shot. One word can describe this place GROSS!!! The food sounded great but then you took a bite and ewww disappointment. The salsa was lame, the chips stale. There were only two good things about this place the soda and the waitress was nice. Other than that dont waste your money GO TO ABUELOS...it may be on the west side but it never disappoints."
4,"I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this place. When I first saw the address, I was very skeptical. It is in Sunnyslope. I literally had to tell myself that there are still some gems on Central and that this place was probably one of them. Im so glad I had that talk with myself. This place is nestled into a great little area of shops and cute patio homes, small businesses and a school. They have a great atmosphere, the inside has roll-up, garage doors and there is a huge patio.  My friends and I settled into one of the sofa areas and made ourselves comfortable. They have a decent happy hour, all wines are 1/2 off and beer is $2.00 off. We ended up having some wine and a selection of brushetta, all was pretty yummy.  The brushetta wasnt the best I have ever had, but there was a nice selection and it was pretty tasty.  We had the brie and apples (delicious, how could you go wrong), mozzarella and tomatoe (also really yummy), brie and bacon which I didnt try and the tapenade (a little salty, but what can you expect from chopped up olives?).  Once happy hour ended, our very knowledgeable and helpful server told us that for $20 we could get a bottle of wine and another order of brushetta, so we did. Hey, why not, its Monday!?!  Ultimately, I was only supposed to stay for an hour (I was sick and jet-lagged and just needed to go home) and I ended up staying for almost four hours. As it got darker, the place took on a very sexy, relaxed vibe. I definitely like the place and I will be back.  Good atmosphere, good food, reasonable prices and friendly service."
5,Food is outstanding! Rebecca rocks!!!!!!
4,"What The Duce!? For starters, where the heck is this place? At first, I wasnt sure if I should be walking in simply because the factory workshop look threw me off!  Um ... hello?  No worries, once we walked into the store area thats when the fun started.  This place really got my interest.  Seems to me you can purchase some vintage items and clothes.  They had stadium-seating area with a projector screen, an ice cream shake area, boxing ring, and a small gym -- where the heck am I!    We finally found the restaurant area shortly.  The kitchen is an old school food truck, then again everything about this place is old school; chairs, tables, etc.  I ordered the sliders because it was a recommendation - meatball, chicken sausage, and bbq brisket.  A bottle of coke -- yep it figures.  Meatball sliders were the best of the 3, the sausage was definitely and acquired taste.   My sis, had the eggs and avocado one and it was okay.   I enjoy my visit to the Duce simply because of its odd ball nature.  Its definitely an experience wortha visit.  -  Enjoy!"
4,"Pleasantly surprised, great drink specials and cute outdoor seating. Food was really good and I look forward to going back!"
3,After our fav Mongolian place closed I was set on having Mongolian the night we came across AJs. It was decent.  It seemed a bit over priced.  The soft serve was kinda gross and the chocolate was out of order.  The all you can eat soup looked like it had been sitting there for a good 8 hours.  Will I go back? Maybe.  Was I impressed? Not really. Did I leave full? Yes.
5,"Excellent food! I do say the service isnt always the best, but the outcome of the food exceeds my expectations. Definitely recommend ordering the Artichoke Salad! Not what youd expect out of a typical boring salad! Not just stuffed with a large amount of dull, boring lettuce, but filled with spices and tons of flavor."
2,"So Ive been back to Ra a few times now, and while the food is always acceptable, the service has gotten progressively worse each time. Today my co-worker and I actually waited an unbelievable 50 minutes for our food, which - if your waitress stops by, checks in with you, apologizes, lets you know she knows youve been waiting - wouldnt have been nearly so bad. Still extremely annoying, sure, but forgiveable. Not this waitress - we had to call her over for every thing we needed. Serioulsy, not once did she just stop by to check on us. We had to call her over to place our drink order, ask for sugar for our tea, to place our food order, to get the check, everything. So by the time the food came, I had to scarf down my grilled apple teriyaki salmon brick in 5 minutes to make it back to work on time. Thats it, Ra - youve lost another customer."
4,"Good drinks, great food, and cool music. There is a stage right behind the bar. We tried the Fingerling Potatoes in Tomato Jam and it was fantastic.. I recommend."
4,"We just go there for lunch and its always very good.  I got a burger and a stella.  Both hit the spot.  Our bartender was spot on. Only complaint, please clean that crap up off the floor come on."
5,I had a mani/pedi and they did a wonderful job every time I visit.. The place is clean and the specialists are very nice..
4,"Feels a lot like Thats a Wrap (which used to be in this location).  I love the overhead door; I love fresh air.  Lots of seating and a bike rack (that doesnt really properly serve a lot of bikes, honestly). Food was very, very fresh.  I expected (per norm in most places) corners to be cut where not noticeable (see: frying something often masks its lack of freshness) - corners were not cut.  The three things ordered were all well prepared, fresh and delicious.  The things I oversaw on other tables were also looking mighty tasty. Id love to see a few bottles of craft beer here - thats my personal opinion.  Part of the issue is local laws, the other part is those running the show. Will return, for sure."
3,"A-OK is right and the hype is not always worth the wait. I will keep it simple since there are probably 500 reviews on the place. Pros: Great Hashbrowns, and made from scratch food Good specials to keep things mixed up Great company and service Cons: Guy up front says a little over 35 minutes but really means an hour and 45 minutes Pricey for some dishes Interesting people around while you wait to get inside (street walkers, etc.) the fresh squeezed orange juice is enough liquid to maybe fill up a double shot glass Overall I would love to give this place more stars if I could get in there without wanting to eat a finger due to starvation, and leave a bit more satisfied. Anyone who has eaten at Bryans in San Diego would know what I mean."
5,"Ive been a regular here the past 3 years. Other than the wait being long, the five spot sandwhich and waffle make this place one of my favorite in the nation."
3,Good destination for pizza. Would frequently go there for a slice at lunch when I worked in the area. Nice New York style pizza with a crisp crust.
5,Great Brisket. There has not been good BBQ in south Scottsdale for a long time. There is now!. The food is wonderful and priced well. Stop in and grab a bite.
5,This is my favorite pho joint in all of Arizona. I have been to about 17 from flagstaff to mesa to central and Tucson! The owners are so welcoming and very proud of their business and it shows! The place is always clean and the bathrooms are immaculate! I always order pho Tai and water.. But Ive had both their egg rolls and spring rolls both excellent! I love the broth! Its true pho broth.. Its not the beef bullion cubes other place use and you can defiantly taste the difference! The sprouts are the cleanest I have ever seen! I love this pho place ...  try the greatest pho in Arizona!
2,"Returned here after a years absense. I understand they have had a change in management. some for the better, some for the worse. new general manager and now the service seems much friendlyer and efficient. New chef and now food is slow to arrive and not as good as it used to be. steak was charred, mashed potatos were lukewarm. Took over 30 minutes for our food to arrive. hopefully it was just an off night for the kitchen. but the general feel was that they lost the attention to the little details"
5,"I have been attending Az Combat for the past 9 years and the instructors are fantastic. They teach Kickboxing, Jui-jitsu and MMA classes. Az Combat was one of the very first MMA Gyms in Arizona and have a great reputation as one of the top 10 training gyms in the nation. My daughter has also been at this school for the same amount of time and has taken advantage of many of the classes they offer including their boot camp. I would highly recommend this gym for beginners and the advanced  looking to break into the MMA circle. They have produced some of the top named fighters in Arizona."
1,"I would give this place NO STARS but Yelp! wants me to give at least one.  I went here with my boyfriend last night for dinner and next to our awful Bucca di Beppo (Scottsdale) experience, I have to say, this one is on my list of MOST TERRIBLE restaurant experiences. The service was so bad, we didnt even get to try the food!  True Yelper that I am, I did my homework before suggesting that we come here for dinner. I saw all the reviews about the ""bad service"" , but I paid more attention to the ""Cheap"" and  ""Delicious Pho"" reviews because after all, you cant knock it til youve tried it. Yes, the place looks as divey as any food dive gets, yes the place isnt as clean as it probably can be, but hey, all the best pho Ive  had (Da Vang, Khai Hoan, Pho Thanh) has been from some of the diviest pho spots in town.  I was excited.  It was around 6pm and the place wasnt busy (there were 5 other customers besides us, and 3 of them were on their way out), so we went ahead and sat ourselves down. The server gave us menus, and made her way back behind the cash register.  After looking over the menu for less than 2 minutes (I usually go for the spring rolls + everything pho whenever I visit a new spot), we were ready to order. I tried to make eye contact with our server but she seemed to be preoccupied with laughing and talking with the pre-teen sitting behind the counter with her. I finally made eye contact with her, she looked at me and I looked at her, and she turned back to her conversation. For the next 15 minutes I tried to get her attention to alert her that we were ready to order - no luck. But then I noticed that both her and the girl she was talking to were looking over at us and laughing, occasionally pointing in our direction and laughing some more. I wasnt about to give up because I was determined to try some of their well-reviewed food, but after a quarter of an hour spent trying to get their attention with them just laughing and pointing at us, my boyfriend and I had enough. The way they treated us was disrespectful and humiliating, so we walked out and drove across town to another Vietnamese restaurant.  We are never going back to this restaurant, and I suggest you dont either. Just as it isnt acceptable for customers to be rude to restaurant staff, it also isnt okay for restaurant staff to be blatantly rude to customers who have not done anything to deserve bad treatment. We did not deserve the type of treatment we got at this restaurant and I am seriously fuming with anger as I write this review. I dont care how delicious and cheap your food is, you cannot use that as an excuse to make customers who come in feel like somehow they are undeserving individuals.  Thanks, but no thanks, Pho House. I dont need to feel disrespected and belittled just so I can try your cheap Vietnamese food. I have plenty of Vietnamese friends who have moms who can probably cook better than you can and will treat us a million times better than your staff did last night."
3,"After hearing all of the hype on diners, drive in and dives and reading the yelp ratings, we decided to try it.  We waited over 30 minutes  for a table.  The place is small and outside of a dungy motel.  The service was extremely fast once you got in the door and the waitstaff are very friendly.  I had a waffle and it was good but nothing memorable.  My partner had an omelette with portguese sausage that he loved.  The hash browns were so buttery and they were good.   I wouldnt make a special trip back."
4,"Great ambiance, good food.  My husband and I had the Southwest Benedict and Eggs Benedict, both were delicious.  I do wish the eggs were a bit more runny and the food was warmer, but the presentation was beautiful."
4,"Im glad I made a second trip to Papago before writing a review, because they have redeemed themselves from my original visit. The problem with my first visit was two-fold: 1) The beers that were most interesting to me had run dry; 2) The food I ordered was pretty hard to grunt down. And although I sat at the bar with my compadre and tried to make conversation with the bartender about the different beers offered, it was fairly one-sided. I did not get a dose of craft beer expertise from what is arguably a brewpub that showcases a true love for beer. So regardless of the less-than-stellar first visit, I still was impressed with the selection of draft beer especially the regional offerings. The built-in beer coolers are also a testament to a great place to sample different labels. The one thing I must caution others against is the food. The steak sandwich I ordered (with special gardiniera) was pretty lousy. The beef had a precooked-then frozen-then reheated quality. The gardiniera was essentially all jalapeños and too fiery to eat... I had to scrape a fair amount of them off to make it edible. I had a good time drinking some decent beers with my friend, but we both regretted our food choice. My return visit restored my faith. The beer list was current and updated. There was a large variety of new draft beers to choose from, and my group ordered two pizzas. This place has delicious pizza! Our waiter was especially knowledgeable about the beers being offered and was able to help us choose especially interesting ones. I like the atmosphere and crowd at Papago and intend to return. But I will definitely stick to the pizza."
3,Its okay. its nothing like San Francisco food .
3,"A girlfriend and I have been meaning to check Bombay Spice out for a while but have never gotten around to it until last night. (I found a great deal on LocalDines.com -use ref # 102729 if you sign up! Also, checking in with FourSquare got a us a deal! )  We ended up going a little later (8ish) so there wasnt a wait or a crowd at all which was nice because the venue is a little smaller. The bartender was very friendly, our serve was a little distracted and took a little longer to respond to our needs but she was very nice. We both had wine, the ""single glass"" serving is actually 2 glasses in case you are torn between splitting a bottle for $20 or just buying a glass for $6.  I recommend the Falling Star Cab, it was full bodied and very yummy. The other wine we tried was the Hob Nob Pinot Noir. It was great, it had a delicious combination of earthy and sweet tones to it. (I am not very good with wine lingo, but those are my unofficial terms that make sense to me.) Neither of us were very hungry but we wanted to sample the fare so we could at least see if we wanted to come back. We got to choose either a free humus or a dessert because of my deal for checking in on FourSquare (POWER NERD! I know.) I really wanted to try the mango sorbet but we opted for the chickpea hummus and roti bread. For those of you, like me, who arent sure what roti bread is- its much lighter than pita bread and a little thinner than a tortilla. Its very tasty. The hummus was very good, and they garnished it with diced tomatoes, onions and cilantro which i loved! We also ordered the seared eggplant. It was AWESOME. It was a large slab of eggplant with a black sauce that was herby (thats a technical term in case you were wondering). They also served the egglplant with a yellow sauce drizzled on the plate which was sweet and very good, in addition to a small scoop of a red chili sauce (our waitress told me the name and I couldnt remember it for the life of me) which was spicy...I really loved this sauce it was the perfect amount of spice for the eggplant.  I will be going back here to try the curry and some of the other things on the menu i cant pronounce.  There are a LOT of vegetarian/vegan dishes clearly marked on the menu. Their menu also boasts that everything, except for 9 or 10 items, is completely Gluten free. Good experience, definitely looking forward to trying it again for a full meal."
4,"Very fun atmosphere and really good tasting food. Portions were large but not overwhelming so. Banana walnut pancakes were fragrant, tasty, light, and just the right balance between salty and sweet. Eggs Benedict was also very very good.  Definitely a place to frequent often as long as you dont mind a line, counter ordering, and finding a place to sit without a hostess."
4,"Good food, good drinks, fun bar. There are quite a few Buffalo Wild Wings in the valley and theyre a fun place to grab a quick lunch or dinner and watch the game.   They have a pretty good garden burger and their buffalo chips (french fry-ish things) are really good.  If you like bloody marys, they have the best one. Its so good...really spicy and filled with celery and olives.  Be careful when you come though, if there is a game on, youll have to get there early or you definitely wont get a spot to sit."
4,"Very good Rubios, very accommodating for my diet needs and the kids love their taquitos.  It is in a convenient location when you are shopping and dont have time to go home.  The management seems to be on top of things and keep the place very clean."
5,"Mmm dirty hipster bars.  Let me count the ways in which I love you. You are cheap (we had $2 Stellas) You are interesting (local art on the walls that Im told changes regularly) You are full of pretension (people watching is always worth the price of admission) You are friendly (like minded souls can smell each other out) If you are in the Roosevelt district, I highly recommend stopping in for happy hour.  Its cheap and hipstery.  Both words have been used to describe me, so I am naturally predisposed to this place."
3,"We were still on a search for New Mexican food and I read up on this place and it was also recommended by a friend.  It was average, not very New Mexican.  I tried the pecan grilled shrimp tacos and they were good! My boyfriend got the stacked enchiladas which was just ok.  Still on the hunt for good New Mexican food in AZ."
3,"Came for dinner with a friend with the $2 off coupon. The service was attentive, friendly, and overall excellent. The english conversation is less than stellar but the fact they took off $2 from both of our meals more than makes up for it. Still a little pricey for two gals with small appetites but not bad. Pani poori, naan, mango lassi, hot chai tea, tikka masala, paneer makani, lamb curry, and many other options available. I would avoid the gross spaghetti noodle option and awkward as it sounds mango flavored other fruit custard.  Overall a good experience. My favorite part is that the separators still have bears from when it was a black bear diner!"
5,"When I first stepped into Smeeks, my entire face lit up, I was figuratively (and quite literally) ""a kid in a candy store.""  Its is a true one of a kind store, its so entertaining to just walk around in. The decor is fun, the inventory is even more fun, and the photo booth is by far the most fun! The walls are full of great novelty items, such as the Smoking Baby (that actually smokes!), Yodeling Pickle (that actually yodels!), and Fake Cigarettes that are surprisingly realistic! Plus, Smeeks has a lot of really cool, and delicious candy. My personal favorite was the Fat Pig organic chocolate bar (with Puntini coming in a close second).  Smeeks is most definitely my new favorite store in CenPho!"
4,"This place is so cute.  To begin, it is trendy but comfortable.  The service is fantastic and the food is really good.  We were a party of six, and ordered a few appetizers (the deviled eggs were good) and for lunch, many of us did half flatbread/half salad..for a reasonable $10.  Mine was delicious.   I had a blueberry salad which was really tasty, and my margherita pizza was great.  The sun-dried tomatoes were perfect.  I will be back for sure when Im up for drinks....a wee bit early for drinks today as we ate at 11:15."
4,"Ive been here a couple times and from reading other reviews, I must have come on a good night!  Both times I was here we sat on the patio and really enjoyed the atmosphere.  They have a large rock pit? in the middle that they light when its cold for heat.   I really love the mussels in the white sauce here and last time I also had the spinach salad.  It was delicious!  Fresh and served with the perfect amount of bacon vinaigrette. The service is good, nothing special - but what is with the waitresses wearing flip flops?  I just dont see how that is sanitary especially if theyre walking in the kitchen.   Overall it was good and Im sure Ill be back.  I keep meaning to come for happy hour when they have 1/2 price appetizers!  A bowl of mussels and a glass of Sauvignon Blanc is all I need for an inexpensive and tasty dinner."
3,"Dont go to Dos for authentic Mexican food or stellar service, youll be disappointed.  Go to Dos for a fun atmosphere, good Happy hour and cheap ""bar"" food... then youll be pleased!  Dos usually hits the spot after a hot day at the baseball game or for a first stop before a night out on the town.  It has all the essentials, food, ATM, toilets and a huge selection of booze!"
2,"This place is more miss than hit, I stop by here for breakfast on rare occasions and the food usually comes out more than slightly mangled.   The food is usually edible and the customer service at the window is always friendly.  Ive never had the experiences that Phoenician C has but I will admit that this can be one of the lower end McDs that Ive been to in this town. Curse you McGriddle!!!"
5,"After flying across the country we were hungry and as Ive done in many other cities, I went in search of pho.   I ordered the pho dac biet.  The broth was not oily, and packed with flavor.  The noodles were just right and there was a generous amount of tripe and tendon."
5,"Still my most favorite hot dog ever and I think the magic is in the presentation. Theyve got the best hot dog sleeve. It perfectly holds the dog, lots of chili and its not messy. Another must have is a Cherry Lime Squeeze; Sprite, Cherry flavor, squeezed limes and maraschino cherries."
4,"It was almost impossible for me not to stop here on the cab ride back from old town for carne asada fries.mmmm sooo good! I really only went there between the hours of 2-4am but, los betos never let me down."
4,Ive been here many many times and have never had a bad time. Everything has always been up to par. I literally have no complaints. AND - I recently dropped a personal check made out to me while getting cash out to pay my bill. The manager found it and mailed it back to my client. Talk about honest service.  BJs is our go to place for an easy weekend lunch. Their home brewed root beer is super good.
4,"I love this place!!! Lots of space and cheap, TASTY Mexican food. Not much more than that needs to be said."
1,"No.   If you ask me about eating at Papaya Thai, that is what I will say.  0 stars for the single kinda scattered and scruffy staffperson.   0 stars for the cook who cannot prepare an offering from the menu as the menu describes it. In this case, I was down to two remaining untried Thai restaurants within quick reach of the Valley Metro Limo, and both in Tempe.  The other half was in Tampa, and since he does not care much for Thai, I get the chance to try one.   The limo arrived at Southern and Mill at 5:17 PM, and connected me with another limo at Broadway. With traffic, getting to McClintock took nearly 15 minutes.  On exiting the limo, 5:50 PM, I walked back about half a block to the restaurant. On entering the restaurant, I picked up a menu and rang the bell and a somewhat harried staff person came to greet me.  He asked me where I wanted to sit, at a table with 1 bench looking directly into the side of a huge fish tank...or the next table, which would leave no buffer between myself and the only other table seated in the restaurant.   There are at least 120 seats in this restaurant.  Why so fiercely contain people in the first three tables close to the door?  You must get your business in fits and hurries and keeping only the 3 tables active is working for you?  Then again, your telling me you are the only staffperson does not surprise me.  The Help Wanted sign on the door was more than an indication that Help is NEEDED! When I was seated, staffperson offered to bring water.  The phone rang and he was off, as he offered another version of ""I am the only staffperson here...""  I looked at the menu and made my decision. In the menu, there is a $2 charge listed for sharing.  This goes against everything Thai I have ever known.  The traditional Thai meal has everyone enjoying some of each dish served.  Because of my proximity to the fish tank, I was quite up close and personal with the fish. The water probably isnt filthy, but the plexiglass tank is not helping the perception.  6 PM, as the cellphone chime reminds me of the passing of an hour.  I am waiting for water and a staffperson who can take my order. 6:01, the staffperson comes, bearing a pitcher of water and a (My eyes are rolling in opposite directions because I am either overworked or stoned) smile.  He filled up my glass and asked if I was ready to order.  I replied that I was and ordered Som Tom, the Thai name for the green papaya salad. Staffperson replied that he did not know the Thai names for the menu items.  The phone rang again. Staffpersons attention was no longer on me.  The phone, his Pavlovian stimuli, had taken him away.  I asked if he had heard me.  He replied that he needed to go answer the phone.  He asked if I minded waiting, as he was the only staffperson.  I said I would wait.  Off he went, in pursuit of electronic interaction.   6:10 PM, staffperson returns, apologizing for the telephone delay and asking about my order.  I ordered the papaya salad without the green beans and steamed rice on the side.  Staffperson took the order and went to the kitchen.  The phone rang as he left the table,  his pace quickening as he approached the phone.   6:18 PM, the door opens and 2 potential patrons enter.  The bell rings and staffperson rushes to the waitstand to greet 2 new patrons.   6:20 PM, staffperson returns. He brings the salad and a bowl of rice.  The salad that appears has some of the traditional salad ingredients along with ingredients that have no business being in the salad.  Som Tom does not have cucumber, shredded lettuce or cilantro.  On sending back the initial preparation, staffperson returned with the original preparation, advising the chef stated ""This is a traditional Thai presentation of the dish"".  I sent the order back, citing the inconsistencies and asking for a new presentation. 6:25 pm.  As I empty my water glass, the salad I received previously is returned, minus the cucumber.  In asking staffperson if this is a new presentation or if it is an attempt to correct the original, he replied that he did not know.  I stood and left.  While the advertisement on the window of the establishment says they have ""The Best Curry in the Valley"",   they will get no second chance to prove it to me.  For all the phone activity, there was no one who came to pick up a carry-out order.  Between this and the somewhat glazed staffperson, I have to wonder if this place is not a front for a drug business."
4,Excellent service. Thankyou Denise! Food was excellent...the two of us shared the C4 salad and a custom and pizza with a cappuccino and a latte.  Everything was very good and the portions big!
4,"Upon our overnight stay at Econolodge a few blocks down, the live lit sign along side of the street attracted me to try this restaurant.  I remember the menu vaguely, however did not forget the amazing breakfast special the other half and I ordered.  $6 for a plate of thick cut bacon, 2 eggs made your way, hash browns, and toast (white/wheat/rye, etc.)  Customer service was great, the hostess and waitress made us feel very comfortable!"
5,"Any parent with young children can vouch for me on this one...keeping the attention of a three year old is, to say the least, difficult. They need constant stimulation, otherwise, there very well may be hell to pay! Enter, the Childrens Museum of Phoenix! The facility is an old school, converted into three stories of pure fun and energy!  After you pay your standard $11/person older than 1 (or your $22 for up to four people with a Groupon), you encounter a three story art project that can only be described as AWESOME! There are multiple ways in which your children can traverse this mammoth. The various pathways challenge children in strength, balance, and critical thinking skills...all of the ways you want to challenge your child! After your child has lost interest in this room, you progress to the second floor. Here, children get to experiment with a really cool board that can only be described as ""Plinko-esque"". Here, children can alter the path of a falling object by changing different platforms. My daughter thought I was a genius because I was able to predict where her object would land every time...its a shame shell ultimately realize how routine that feat really is.   After Plinko, children can either go to the trike wash, build forts, or they can head to the art room. After some laps through the wash, my daughter wanted to head into the art room. Being that we went right before Halloween, our child had the opportunity to make black play dough (to make spiders), she got to paint on a giant rocket ship, and then she was able to make a spooky tree out of a brown paper bag. Such simple activities...such great opportunities! After cleaning all of the paint from her smock, we made the journey up...to the third floor. Here, children get to play grown-ups. Theres a mock supermarket that allows children to either shop, ring up merchandise, or work in the stock room of a miniature grocery store. After shopping, our daughter wanted to work at the little ice cream stand located just outside of the grocery. We had fake ice cream cones and sat at the tiny bistro set while we watched children make their way through the noodle forest. We then made our way to the end of the hall to race miniature race cars on roller skate wheels. Being only three floors, our day at the museum only lasted a couple of hours...but in those short hours, my daughter never stopped smiling! How on earth could you rate any place less than five stars when it brings so much joy to YOUR pride and joy?"
4,Fancy ladies with a few gays sprinkled in. This is NM Cafe! Popovers. Prawn and avocado salad. Glass of Sauvignon Blanc. Make your reservation under Candy Spellings name. You will get the BEST table.  Works every time.
5,"If you are looking for TLC in very unique pet products and family style customer service, Posh Pet Boutique and spaW is where you need to go. They have retailed my collection of Decadent Digs there for going on 3 years, since the first day she opened her doors. I have seen her business blossom and become the destination and extra sunshine of the Troon Area. Her loving warmth (sort of Doris Day way) makes you feel like you are in her home and makes want you to come back often. She carries a huge collection of class act merchandise from cute clothes to a killer Kitty high-rise and offers excellent grooming. She is worth the trip."
5,"If you are writing poor reviews you obviously have not eaten Susies Chile Verde con Carne.   I dream about it.  And I grew up in New Mexico!  The best  bowl of green chili stew or even better the green enchiladas with melt-in-your-mouth beef anywhere in town.  #13...dont forget the sour cream.    So you with the 2 & 3 stars go back and try the green chili and watch your stars become shooting stars!  Ive never tried anything else there.  Why would you when youve found green chili heaven? Man, just talking about it makes me drool.  Im headed out the door.....Susies here I come!"
3,"The owner of Vermont Sandwich Co. just contacted me and offered to make right what happened to me during my last visit.  Nice gesture but I had to decline.  I didnt write what I did for a handout but Im giving this place one more star for the offer. Vermont Sandwich Co is very highly rated.  For the owner to try to make right by one negative commenter among a multitude of positive, says something about the owners integrity. I think a return visit to Vermont Sandwich Co. may be in order..."
4,"I love the ambiance at Joes Farm Grill.  Its great to grab your food and sit outside at one of the many picnic tables.  Stopping there with the dogs after an afternoon at Cosmo Dog Park is a must!  There is something for everyone on the menu, from gourmet burgers (all I have to say is fontina! Yum!) to pizza, to ribs. Its also a great place to take out-of-state guests who just blew into town from one of those cold climates.  They are usually psyched to be sitting outside enjoying a meal during the winter without having a propane heater involved.   Make sure you go for a walk on the grounds too.  Its very relaxing and a great way to work off a few calories!"
3,"I dont know why it is that all these airports have such a major lack of seating.  The staff here are friendly, and security is quick, but I just wish theyd work on the gate areas and add more seats.  Need an example?  Sacramento Internationals new terminal."
4,"This is by far my hubbys favorite lake for bass fishing.  I am not a fan of waking up at 4am in the morning to get there by 5am...not for fishing.  Yes, that is all my boys do here. It gets really packed on the weekends by 9am.   When the water is low, it is not easily accesible from the picnic spots.  It also gets super windy, enough to go windsurfing (too bad its a long treck for us).   You really have to have a boat to enjoy this lake.  The absence of shade trees make the heat uncomfortable in the middle of summer, you might as well go to Canyon or Saguaro (my faves). I love the sharp edged cliffs juxtaposed against the crystal clear water.  Good photo ops. Why the 4 stars?  Like I said, my hubby loves fishing here for the bass.  For some reason, little bluegills like me.  I also like the floating porta-john and porta-jane...weird, but cool!  Whoever does the draining has a crappy job. All in all, it is a nice big lake and by far one of the cleanest too."
5,"This is a great little authentic Mexican restaurant - dont let the looks fool you, it is delicious!  I had the Tampiquena, it is one of the best I have had.  Highly recommended"
5,"Clean, organized, and well-stocked (for the most part), Fujiyas carries my favorite car freshener, chips, bread, and iced coffee (in a can) among many other good things. Reasonably priced and extremely courteous customer service, I am always happy to shop there. The bentos, I wish, are kept in warmers like Suruki in San Mateo, CA, but Fujiya has an area adjacent to the register which includes a microwave to heat your purchased bento, so you can sit and eat and relax after shopping. What I love so much about their service is that I can place my order ahead of time and theyll have it available and ready. I think this is the only Japanese store that has just about everything I need to stock my pantry. Its no wonder Ive been coming here year after year."
3,"Service was fast and friendly, the mixed drinks are great!  We went on a busy Friday night and a lot of familys where there.  They have a man walking around making balloon figures.  The slide/ stairs is a great touch for kids.  The food was OK, nothing outstanding. The view was amazing, it overlooks the entire city."
3,"Excellent food, top-notch service, exorbitantly priced.  Not for budget minded diners..."
4,"My friend and I decided to try this place for happy hour around lunchtime since its such a short walk from ASU.  I ordered a glass of the crossing, which was tangy, and a little on the dry side with a fruity aroma.  Going off of a college students budget, we shared a plate of the bruschetta which was a bit pricey for 4 slices of baguette with toppings, but delicious nonetheless. Pulled pork and salmon were my two favorite! The atmosphere is great and its always lively and full of people- plus its a great location."
4,"I love the Penang Curry at the Thai House! Better than any other place Ive had. Too, the lunch special is one of the best deals in town. The spring rolls are pretty good, although Im not crazy about the sauce, its a bit too thick and sticky for my liking. The service is okay, during lunch they could use additional help, servers are literally jogging to service their tables. Overall, its a great spot - Im definitely eating there a few times a month if not more."
3,"Bad service, great food, awful coffee."
1,"The food is delicious.  The service:  discriminatory.  The bartender, blonde gentlemen, went around to everyone else, then finally acknowledge us.  This is embarrassing, I dont know what else to say."
5,"Delicious yet again! Pho, garlic green beans, papaya salad...they can do no dish wrong. The owner, Justina, is hip, cool, gorgeous and awesome! Its BYOB so bring a nice wine or beer...no corking fee so dont forget to tip well! If youre eating and theres a big line of others waiting, please do what we do and go across the street to gelato so that other people dont have to wait an hour."
5,Amazing food. Great date night place with an impressive wine list.  Definitely come her again and more often.
1,Experience with Hostess was rude. Service with a frown. Our waiter had attitude too. It was a birthday dinner and we were in great spirits..so this review is written with clarity. The margaritas were strong-check ok there. The shrimp appetizer was different and very good and $18 for four shrimp. We ordered two mahi mahi dinners (each $24)and they were RANCID. Yup. I said RANCID. We asked if the shrimp fajitas dinner had the same jumbo and they said they would have to charge extra (each entree was priced at $30) we had to pay extra for the beans and rice that they had left on the table-which was cold by the time the shrimp dinner--which came with 5 shrimp and onions.  Poor service with an attitude. Mediocre food to say the least...all over-priced. Never going back.
3,"I am an avid quilter and moved here recently. I am on the hunt for a new quilt shop and I went here, despite the ""grandma quilt shop"" name lol. The staff was VERY nice and helpful and friendly. The shop a little on the small side, which made me surprised to find that they have a very decent selection of contemporary fabrics! My only disappointment is that that they dont have fat quarters cut of each of the fabrics, though they will cut fat quarters - but thats not something I want to have to wait around for.  They carry a small selection of minky and home dec fabrics as well. I will definitely be back there!"
5,"When Im casual but want to feel NYC I go to Christophers.  We go here for a special occasion dinner or on the fly happy hour...which is the best HH food in town!  Let me repeat that - best in town!!!   Hamburger with truffle fries, brick oven pizza or a perfect salmon salad plus a beer or glass of wine for about $10/person. Cant beat it!  Sitting at the open kitchen makes me appreciate the setup and organization required to run a restaurant as well as the chefs tatts!?  If you dont want the blaring heat of the brick oven, dont sit at the corner next to it...Phoenix is HOT enough in the summer, so cool off and let someone else do the cooking!"
4,"I gave an extra star just because it is so fun to hang out here.  The waitresses are always cute and friendly and not afraid to pour your drink.  Alot of my friends are in love with the food here, I have to disagree. I think good but not great.  Still this place gets the nod from me just because it is so fun to hang out.  Chances are you will meet some new friends there too."
2,"I went because several people I know raved about the place, because Im a lapsed vegetarian and Im always trying to get back on track and heard the veggie sandwiches were incredible, and because Im a malt freak and found out they have malteds there. I was disappointed. And my friend I was with who had been one of Sticklers die-hard fans said that, although it was okay this time, the place seems to have gone down hill. Sticklers wasnt busy at all, maybe 4 tables of customers and 3 people in line, but although there were alot of workers behind the counter, the service was very slow. We had to wait a long time for our veggie sandwiches. Now my friend has been there when it was jam-packed and she said the service then was much quicker. We went about 2 so maybe the staff was worn out from the lunch rush earlier. The bread was good, crunchy on the outside and soft inside but the vegetarian sandwich itself was boring. Its supposed to have Swiss, Provolone and American cheese on it. I couldnt even taste the Swiss or Provolone at all, the American over powered the sandwich and was more like a cheez-whiz type. Im always on the look out for a good malt, one that really tastes like a malt and not a shake. My chocolate malt tasted more like a shake and I wasnt impressed with the ice cream. My buddy liked her vanilla malt though. The one thing I did like about Sticklers is that they have the small bags of Miss Vickies chips to buy. It used to be you could buy big bags in the grocery stores but now the chips,which are the best kettle chips Ive ever had, are just carried in certain deli and sandwich shops."
3,"Big fan of their SW Chicken Caesar salad and fire roasted tomato soup. My favorite sandwiches are the chicken panini, the turkey cranberry, and the teriyakki chicken wrap. I love both wildflower and Paradise but Paradise Bakery has the best cookies. And although I do not get it very often because its a killer in calories, the chocolate cheesecake brownie is to die for!"
4,"Grab a cup, grab an outdoor chair, enjoy the show!"
4,"This is a new neighborhood breakfast joint in a building many think is ""cursed"".  The turnover for businesses at this location is high.  But I think Oink is going to make it!  They were very busy when we were there so it took a little bit to get refills on coffee (need bigger cups) and the food took a couple minutes longer, but no worries.  Who I think is the owner was not just standing by and watching everyone else run around like chickens with their heads cut off, they were serving, clearing plates, filling coffee.  Love to see that!   The menu is decent.  Im not a huge breakfast person but there were quite a few items on the menu I was interested in.  The funny thing is my hubby and I ended up not ordering any bacon and didnt realize this until after we finished eating!  So we definitely will be going back to try the bacon they are known for....jalapeno bacon anyone!"
5,"I hardly ever get past their carne adovada. Its simply amazing. Add a couple of extra homemade tortillas to it? Cant be beat! I have had their pecan crusted sea bass also, along with lamb chops (chipotle?) both very, very good. Great atmosphere, friendly, competent staff...a winning combination. Get there early! Long waits after 6:00pm!!"
5,"I heart Romes Pizza!! Being a native New Yorker, I have struggled over the past two years to find anything remotely close to NY style pizza. I had tried many local, independent places, but no one got it right.  When I moved back to Scottsdale about 6 months ago my guy and I passed this place driving down McDowell road. I figured we could try it out (Im always on the look out for some yummy pizza). Dont be taken back by the empty parking lot and shabby exterior, after all, isnt it whats inside that counts??  The food is always fresh. The Greek salad is great - it comes in small and large. The pizza is amazing (as long as you know what youre getting - NY style). I know that its family owned, which I always have an appreciation for.  The man that owns it does most of the deliveries. When I first moved to the area I called for delivery and he had to call me because he couldnt find my street. Embarrassingly, I only knew the street I lived on and not much more, so I couldnt help him. He told me that it was okay and eventually found the house.  I expected him to get out of the car and give me a huge attitude, thinking Im an idiot because I didnt know where I lived (could you really blame him?). But he was as sweet as could be and told me it was no problem. How refreshing!  In a nutshell, hoooorray for Romes!!"
5,"I have been trying to get into a consistent workout routine for years... Ive tried it all! gym memberships, pilates, training for a marathon but was never able to stick with anything... until Karve that is! My husband found it for me on here actually and thought I should try it (not sure what he was trying to hint at with that... but i love my improved Karve body too much now to care :) Anyway, I went and am now hooked! it is the greatest work out ever - its hard but the results happen so quickly that its motivating... and its really the only workout routine that Ive ever been able to stick with ever!  and with going multiple times a week I found that it even changed my appetite - I no longer feel annoying cravings so eating healthier is easier for me (a former carb/chocolate fiend) It really helped me finally get into a more active/healthy lifestyle - I know that sounds so cliche but Im still shocked everyday that a lazyass/sweets-eating like me is actually working out on a regular basis - and its all bc of the great method of Karve.... plus the instructors are SO sweet and nice/friendly and supportive Im honestly making friends there... all in all a stellar review for Karve Studio!! im a believer :)"
4,I was very happy with the food and service. The service was wonderful and quick too.
2,"Nah. I forked over $13 for a club sandwich, mac n cheese, and a large Pepsi.  The mac n cheese was good, and the sandwich was just okay.  I say take your $13 and go to Texaz Grill!!!  WAY better food, and for $13 you can get dessert too."
4,"Good little place in old town across from Cowboy Ciao. Had the turkey apple swiss wrap w/ dried cranberries,local greens, smoked bacon, and cashews. Very good and great size. The lady had the grilled chicken & sage pesto sandwich w/ goat cheese, gala apple, and smoked bacon. She liked it as well. The sweet potato chips were very good too. will be back for sure."
5,"St. Francis gives the impression you could be dining in one of the finest cities in the world, instead of the 5th largest cities in the USA. Start with their cucumber gin drink, and then order another.  Goat cheese on crostini follows.  Insist on extremely memorable whipped potatoes--a side order-- to accompany your salmon on red quinoa.  Dessert MUST be the chocolate cake with peanut butter gelato accompanied by carmel sauce trailings and carmel corn garnishes. Try dining at the bar for an uncluttered view out the picture window opening, minus the glass. Loved it!  Will happily return. They split our entree for us AND were gracious about the extra trouble we caused--not a wimper.  Truly superior service !"
5,"Unfortunately I dont get enough chances to come here but, Id say I have been here about a dozen times and each time I have never been let down.  The beer is great, the food is great, especially their french fries and the crowd is OK.  Yes it is in Tempe and youre stuck with all the ASU kids but I like to come here in the summer time or when ASU is on break because it is the locals that are here.  It is not the nicest brewery that I have ever been to, but what they lack in aesthetics they make up for in beer.  A must go to place if youre in the Tempe area!"
3,"Yes I am writing a review about Red Lobster, dont judge me!! You all know you love those little cheddar biscuits more then life itself!  Seriously, Those biscuits, good lord!  Hubs and I went here last night, his picking. He loves him some Ultimate Feast. I usually stick to the coconut shrimp.  Our waitress was awesome, the place was packed to the gills but we never really had to wait for refills. She did forget to put in for the beer hubs ordered, but he lived (YAY)!  The food comes out hot and fast.  We also got an appetizer, did the ""pick two"" the mozzarella sticks were surprisingly good and the calamari wasnt just fried calamari but it came with fried broccoli and red peppers as well, super tasty!"
5,"I always buy my tires at Walmart, but they didnt have a tire to fit my car. They directed me to Discount Tire and told me that they actually have better pricing. I went to this location and had the best experience. They were very helpful, saved me money, and I was in and out in under 25 mins. I will be back again and again!!!!"
1,"Can someone please tell me why people go here??? Went to breakfast with Deb L, and she had a Living Social deal or one of those deal thingies. The place was packed, probably because its a holiday week. That doesnt excuse the EXTREMELY poor service. We sat down and waited. And waited. Servers walked by every few moments, nobody stopped to fill our water glasses or take our order. Finally, we both said something to a girl who walked by. She seems mystified that there was a job to do. With that many people working, getting a cup of coffee shouldnt take 15 minutes. Yes. 15 freaking minutes. Food? Mediocre at best. I got the traditional eggs benedict with home fries. The only saving grace with the amount of ham on it. The English muffin didnt seem to be toasted. The eggs were *ok* but nothing great. The home fries? My 9-year old niece could do a better job. My burps right now arent even good enough to brag about. Im sure if the service had been better, I wouldnt be so miserable right now. My food coma isnt satisfying. I will *never* go here again. Ever. I felt stupid leaving a tip, it was THAT bad.  Total. Fail. Blech."
4,"Kale, miso, shrimp dumplings... all good"
4,YUM! The flavors were great! Oatmeal cookie and caramel apple were great and tasted just like the real thing. The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 is because some of the toppings such as the twinkies and baklava were whole pieces and I wish I could have just grabbed pieces of them instead of a whole one...toppings like those could add a lot of $$ very quickly so I skipped those ones.
5,DUDE..where is the manga....where are the card tables. .....What the heck is this place doing selling comics! This is outrageous!  And why are you talking to me and trying to help me comic clerk! Your job is to give me a huge sigh and exasperated look as if I asked you to perform surgery. This being helpful and friendly is really bothering me. You guys are just too weird. I need to go back to Atomic.
2,"I cannot stand this mall. They have some really awesome stores but the people who work in them are obnoxious. Most of the people walking around are snooty as can be, and everything is overpriced. The food court has some good selection, but is always super crowded and you can rarely find anywhere to sit. Parking is awful."
2,"Absolutely, positively bitter. They use a powder in lieu of syrups which adds a after taste I dont care for. There was no color difference between my beverage (latte) and my friends (iced coffee). Why... I have no clue. We order these drinks everywhere and this has never happened before. I can see how a powder would be more cost effective but the taste was something I did not care for. Maybe that makes me a coffee snob, I am not sure."
4,"Maybe closer to 3.5 but I am rounding up because Im not opposed to being won over by ""smart"" bartenders -- when I ordered drinks she asked to see my ID and then followed it with, ""you look so young, you must get that often."" Granted, she looked younger than me, but I am not opposed to having my reviews swayed by cute bartenders who know the right buttons to push. In addition, the house margarita was good, and I have been known to throw bad margaritas all over the bar in a fit of rage when I dont get carded...fortunately my vanity was satisfied.  The space is very nice and open, and despite the decent size crowd, it didnt feel crowded. Our wait was less than 20 minutes and there is ample place to sit and have a drink while you wait. Now, I must say, I dont know that the required staff uniform is unattractive, but it does seem like an impromptu tennis match could break out any moment.  The braised short rib enchiladas were good and the fish tacos were even better. The tacos were slightly overstuffed and rather difficult to eat as a result, but the taste was good (3 shells, as opposed to 2, with the same amount of taco insides would be better).  While the waitress didnt attempt to win me over with flattery, the service was prompt and attentive."
2,"Took almost 45 mins for a oil change (they told me 20 mins when I got there) and it cost something like that as well...  Slow and expensive, not 2 things I like associated with my lube jobs."
5,I love this place! Great place to grab a quick smoothie or stay to hang out! (just let them know if youre in a  hurry) P.S. The phone number is area code 480 not 490 :)
4,"Couple things.  First, I am reviewing a Delivery order that I placed.  (If you didnt know that they delivered... Now you do!) You start by looking at their website, which is modest.  Its a black background with White text.  Pretty much all of their food is available for take-out, except for the alcohol. *TIP* Make sure to look at their PDF Menu.  It has TONS of more choices than what is listed on their Website.  I wasnt even aware of this fact until I had ordered my food. At this point, they do not have online ordering set up, so you call and place your order that way. Cornish Pastys (pronounced Pastie, not Pastey) are amazingly delicious.  They take whatever filling you choose (from the Chicken Alfredo to the Bangers and Mash), and they place it in a thin, crisp dough that surrounds it.  Think of a Calzone, except the Irish version. Now, these are very, very filling.  They are modestly priced (all of them are less than $10), and they are EXTREMELY DELICIOUS. Make sure you give them a try.  I will sure be eating here again!"
5,Just moved to AZ and this is my local Petco. Everyones really helpful and friendly. We just took our dogs here to get groomed and they came back smelling fresh and looking clean.
3,"3 stars is being generous. Went to Tesoro tonight with my husband and two teenagers based on the glowing yelp reviews.  It is a very small restaurant, 9 - 10 tables with a small waiting area out in front, facing the strip mall parking lot.  We had a reservation for 7:30.  Arrived on time and were apologetically told that our table was not yet ready.   Had to wait out front for 20 minutes shivering. After we were seated, drink, wine, and appetizer orders taken, we relaxed and began to settle in.  Problem was, it is a very loud room. Conversation was a challenge.  Looking around, we realized that we were the youngest table in the room.  Average age appeared to be 60+ years old. Oh, well, young and hip it is not.  Hopefully the food is good. Bruschetta and antipasto were tasty.  For entrees, we ordered the homemade Fettuccine Bolognese, Spaghetti al Pomodoro, the Chicken Saltimbocca and a special, Farfalle with shrimp and asparagus.  Flavors were good, not great, but none of the pasta was homemade.  Very much a disappointment. On the upside, service was very attentive and friendly.  Unfortunately, food is only mediocre, and the strip mall location is a definite detraction in size and ambiance.  Would I return again?  No."
5,"When people feel a cold coming, they pop a zinc lozenge or tablet to boost the immune system. I have a much better way to get my zinc supplementation: I head over to Pier 83 for their terrific fried oysters. With the first crunchy bite I begin to feel so much better. Placebo effect, probably. But hey ... as long as I get that feel-good boost, I dont care. The fish and chips are also the best Ive had in the Valley. And to think that Ive previously been trying to get my fish n chips fix from the likes of Petes ... yikes! And their clam chowder is delicious; I dont need to feel under the weather to have an excuse for ordering this tasty bowl of comfort. The friendly staff and comfortable informal atmosphere complete the enticement for many return visits."
4,"Very good coffee!  I get my iced Americano here with room for cream.  The coffee is so much better than the Starbucks down the street, but not as convenient...shamefully to say, theres no drive-through.  When you have a vehicle full of kids which one would you pick?  So, I come here solo right before I wander around the little shops.  A must try!"
4,We ate there last night and were very pleased our meals and service.  The ribs were especially good.  We would go back again.
4,"I just moved to AZ from Honolulu with my bf and found this to be a great breakfast / brunch place. They do close at 2:30pm. On my last visit, I ordered the amazing ""2 for you""! You get the choice of a half sandwich & either soup or salad for $7.95...WHAT A DEAL!! I ordered the  Monterey Club & the No. 5 Chinese salad. What an amazingly refreshing lunch! I highly recommend this day cafe, this may not be the best review, but if you stop by the line may sway you:)"
4,"Stayed here with my girlfriend for a Radiohead show and a get away weekend from work.  Got the hotel for the amenities which were great, we played tennis, enjoyed the fantastic people watching at the pool, great cocktails to include the Tequila Sunrise, and some light putt putt outside our cottage.  The room was not ready when we got there so we got a cottage which was supposed to be an upgrade with a semi private patio.  The room was actually very nice and had a great tv which we might have watched for a grand total of 30 minutes in 4 days.  Our room was made up between 4-5 each day that we planned to stay there and then on the day we plan to check out, they came by at 8:30....not sure what the problem was there.  We also had to call about our A/C after we sweated the first night but it was fixed and no problems after that so maybe it was just a glitch which happens.  You are probably wondering what if anything was wrong, the only issue we had was the concierge.....nightmare, no help whatsoever.  Called several times, both girlfriend and I and got the reply on two separate occasions to just check google.  I have stayed at less nice hotels and had much better service with concierge, this hotel should realize what their clients might be interested in and do some research.   All in all, great trip and a nice and above par stay.  I would certainly stay here again if I can get my girl to go with me!"
4,"I went here for happy hour with a long time friend. I wanted to try something new and Switch totally fit the bill. First off, their happy hour is A-mazing! I had two glasses of white sangria that were just perfect.  My friend and I shared the cheese and fruit plate because it was on special. It was nice to try everything, and since it was on special it made everything taste better. For my meal I had your traditional cheeseburger, and it was very good. I had half to take home which made for an excellent lunch the next day.  The only thing about the place that was a little strange was the crowd. I expected for having such an awesome happy hour it would be busier, however it was kind of dead. I even saw a group of people be seated and abruptly leave. It was kind of strange. Perhaps it was just an off night. This is definitely a place I would go to again!"
5,"I went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago with my bosses. It was packed on a Friday - we sat at the bar and our cook was fantastic! We got to sit and chat with him while he worked away at the orders. I had the chicken pesto pasty and it was wonderful! the bread used is similar to a pastry dough type...but not as sweet. The pasty was so filling, I could barely finish it. My bosses have been there before and have always wanted to try the peanut butter and jelly pasty - so we all split it as dessert and it was so good. They put bananas in it and drizzle jelly over the whole pasty. Its definitely rich and gooey.  I would totally go back here again and have told my friends about it too! Amazing place."
5,"I hired Property AZ to rent my upside-down home in North Peoria (stuck with the house so we rent it out), they are very experienced and had great customer service.  I have had bad experiences in the past with management companies not taking care of the renters or getting back to me."
4,"They try to be like In-N-Out, even down to the color scheme, but the burgers taste very different.  They offer cajun fries which have some extra seasoning, and if you ask for your fries ""well done"" they dont come out as soggy.  But if youre going with someone else, then one order of fries is all youll need.  They give everyone huge helpings of fries and Im never able to finish a single order so I just share it.  The burgers are excellent and the one thing that sets this place a part is the option to get fresh jalapenos on your burger.  Dont forget about breakfast!  This is where In-N-Out fails.  The breakfast burgers are great after a night of partying."
4,"We went there for the first time recently and was pleasantly surprised. We got there about 8pm on a Friday night and the place was still packed. We only waited maybe 5 minutes to get a table which wasnt bad at all.  My date had the BBQ Chicken Sandwich with a side salad. While we were waiting for his salad to come out the server came over and said there was a mistake as he should have already receive his salad and it would be right up, which it was so not a huge deal. A few minutes later our meals came out. While he was hoping it was shredded chicken it was a chicken breast but said it was still quite tasty. I had the 10oz rib eye with sides of green beans and applesauce. The steak was cut perfectly and it was a perfect size portion. The green beans (which the server suggested) were awesome and the applesauce was a nice sweet finish so no dessert was needed. Another bonus is everything (steak, beans, applesauce) were all served on separate plates so no runny juices mixing all over the place which was perfect!!!!  The prices were very reasonable as well.  Overall, we both enjoyed Texas Roadhouse and will certainly be back."
5,"Just did take out.  Great experience.  Easy to place my order over the phone, friendly service.  Nice that they have special pick up parking spots and entrance.  Made it an in and out operation.  Ordered the gluten free pizza with pepperoni and sausage.  My husband and son loved it and have already been asking to get it again.  I had the spaghetti calzone and was in HEAVEN.  I highly recommend it."
5,"Navajo Food at its best !!!!!! I loved everything there ! I guess I love ""BLAND"" food . :-) everything was terrific ...  I ordered the bowl (12 oz) of Mutton Hominy Stew I got it with the Tortilla bread which was AMAZING ! I also ordered a side of Blue Corn Mush to dip into my stew ( which is an awesome combination) ... And I also ordered a Grape Shasta Soda :-D ... My Husband ordered the Vegetable Mutton Stew with fry bread and ordered Strawberry Shasta Soda. He loved everything ! Everything was well worth the wait and the food was extra hot and tasted very FRESH !!! I LOVED IT !"
3,"The ever evolving menu changes again, But a coupon made it a decent buy. I will admit my co workers 2 for 1 coupon is why we went in. This means ~3.25 per burrito vs the usual $6 range. What I didnt like was that my vegetarian burrito did not have vegetables in it, it was just a bean and rice burrito with guacamole. I dont know how one gets the grilled veggies in their burrito but it is not by ordering a vegetarian burrito. The drink and napkin station here has always been a bottleneck, getting a refill or more napkins is nearly impossible. I do like the fact there there is Choula sauce in addition to the red and green tobascos. And I also like that the chairs are not nearly as bad as those at chipotle. The best tip this time is get in before 12, otherwise be prepared for a long long line."
5,"Jodi is fantastic!  Extraordinary!  After too many expensive yet less-than-average salon expereinces, my hair has been less beautiful than its potential.  Jodi gave me a very thorough consultation after I did some research to find the best colorist for me.  During my appointment, Jodi was professional, efficient and friendly.  I left the salon with soft, gorgeous hair... lovely color, care of the INOA line, and I felt beautiful again.  She did what at least half a dozen other highly recommended colorists did not accomplish.  Im ecstatic and relieved and I have finally found my colorist.  What more can a girl ask?  Thanks so much, Jodi."
4,"This place is yummy. The service might not always be, but the food is. They have a sexy bar and great intimate decor and a South West feel that isnt done with terra cotta colored paint and teal cacti pictures. I love the Jelapeno Benedict and they have AMAZING margaritas. And they serve brunch till super late."
5,"Awesome, awesome, awesome....everything was fantastic. The innovative drink menu, the pizza was out of this world and the bartender was very personable. A++ I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. Bant wait to return!"
4,"I met my cousin here for lunch, and we were really happy with the meal.  The place is a less than impressive on the interior, dingy booths, long and narrow.  Its terribly crowded up by the counter, not a lot of room to order and pick up your food. I do question how a place can call itself ""Los Taquitos"" and then not have taquitos on the menu, but I went for the flautas instead.  They were good, but what set the meal apart were the beans.  The most flavorful beans I have ever had.  If you told me these were magical beans, I would have believed it, but I wouldnt have stopped eating them to plant one and see. Service was quick and friendly and there was plenty of seating, even during the lunch rush.  Looked like a lot of people get orders to go.  Id like to go back and try a few other items on their menu, if they come with beans of course."
4,"I ate here on a Sunday afternoon and was impressed by the food quality, very friendly service, and speed of service. On the strength of other Yelps, I had the gravlux with dill mashed potatoes and tomato basil salad. All excellent as others have said. I had broccoli and cole slaw as my other sides. The broccoli was tender without being overcooked and the slaw was a pleasant vinegar-based, not creamy, variety that complemented the rest of the food nicely. The food filled the plate without being overwhelming and I found room for one of the Beaver cookies, actually two large waffle-wafer cookies with a lightly flavored lemon cream between them. The cookies are kept in a chilled pastry case, probably because of the cream filling. A pleasant meal on a hot summer day."
5,"Loved this place!!!! Was searching for a great authentic BBQ place, and this is it!!!!!"
4,Beautiful church!!  We started attending mass here after they brought Jay Soto on as their music director.  He has beautiful voice and also plays piano.  We like Fr. Robinson the best - weve heard all of priests except for Fr. Sullivan.  This is not a cookie cutter church - it feels like a real church with the stained glass and the stations.  My husband is of the faith - not me and Im not given a hard time for not taking communion like the other church we used to attend. I attend to hear the music and companionship for my husband.
4,"Im embarrassed at the number of times Ive eaten here since it opened.  i used to live half a mile from here and was one of the first people in the door.  The bruschetta is the best in town--period, end of discussion.  The salads sometimes arent my favorite, but there are plenty that are delicious.  Ill admit that the cheese plates also sometimes leave me wanting, but that is a rare occasion.  It has been interesting to see the wine selections evolve over the past several years.  When it first opened, Postino seemed to have nothing above $35/bottle, and that selection was good.  It stepped up its game in the past two or three years and now boasts a more diverse and more expensive selection (e.g., Sea Smoke pinot noir).  I appreciate the addition of even better wine, and am happy to say that the glass list remains reasonably priced."
4,"A clean shopping center with many classy options for food, drink and retail therapy."
4,"being new to the area, im really on a quest to nail down my basic food groups: thai, persian, and mexican. mexican ive got down i think, but the other two ive kind of been baffled by. luckily i have my very own personal tour guide who invited me to lunch at yuphas one day.  the place is pretty cute but can get pretty crowded when in the full swing of lunch. the tables are kind of close together, so be sure you arent carrying a big purse or anything otherwise youll be whacking people in the head with it. i had the pad thai for lunch. HUGE lunch portions. i could barely finish a third of it and i had a ton to take home for dinner. also if you arent into spicy, id definitely go mild. medium spicy is pretty groovin, but i dont think it would work out well for someone who only wants a little spice. yuphas also has an interesting salad bar/soup thing that comes with some of the lunches. check out the salad with the peanut dressing. mmmmmm peanut dressing. i loves it.  service is fast and friendly. take your check up to the front if you want to get out of here quickly. i think yuphas is going to be my work lunch thai place :). garlic beef here i come!"
3,"When Im on vacation, I try to go to restaurants I try to avoid chains because whats the point?  I want to eat local eats.  As I walked in, I realized Ive been to the one in Long Beach, CA though the menu was completely different. Or perhaps it was the late night menu but it was decidely more ""Southwestern.""  Ah well, it had been several years and it was quite late at night so it didnt matter at this point. I ordered the green pork tostada which the waiter assured me was very small and the hot wings. The tostada was huge. What a liar (yes, I called him that to his face).  I ate a couple of bites and finished the wings. I would have the tostada cold and congeal-y in the morning before flying out. Surprisingly, the flavors were locked in this way and acceptable as a 5-minute scarf fest.  Oh, and my vodka tonic was very good.  Not bad and I kind of dug our picnic style bench high top table."
3,"Eyebrows are a very touchy subject. Im literally convinced that unless you make some serious cash, finding an excellent and meticulous aesthetician is like finding a needle in a haystack. Well, Yelpers, Ive been searching in this haystack for three months too long, and each time I leave thinking, ""They really dont listen to what I requested and I wasted money."" So, I decided, no longer was I going to leave spending $20.00 (tip included) on mediocre brows. I went back to doing my own, and I am completely satisfied.  Plus, the music selection is terrible. A positive, its neat that they text you a 24 hour reminder notice. However, you better be sure you show up, because they do charge fees for tardies and no-shows."
3,"I decided to give this place a whirl yesterday on my lunch about 5pm from work  the space was nice open airy the staff from front of the house to The wait staff all were very friendly linens on the tables as well as linen napkins the only thing was the menu was a little lack luster the appetizer selection was fair. Hummus,tzatziki  , served w/flat bread ,selection of olives a couple of pork belly selections I had the lamb burger I ordered medium it was served a more rare but was still good the did offer some higher priced entrees and there were other selections of burgers and sandwiches thus the name gastro pub  they had some good beers on tap"
2,"After vine expressions closed many of us have tried this place.  I like new things and love different types of cuisine but this place doesnt hit the spot.  Its nice to go somewhere and get a wine list by the glass where you can choose a wine you enjoy but of course you want to know the freakin vineyard.  Not here.  By the glass, the list just has varietals - shiraz, cab, etc.  They change their list a lot but so do many places.  The food - below average.  Tried the stew that they said was great and famous.  Bland.  The sliders were like eating a salt lick, too salty.  The servers are nice but they tend to ramble on and give you a 15 minute dissertation on the menu and why you shouldnt look at the last page because its not available yet but they want you to know its there.  Finally, a few people mentioned the sucky chairs.  Boy, they werent kidding.  They have many stools at tables with no back.  Customers should be comfortable, this is not.  The seats with backs have as much padding as a 2X4.  Bottomline, uncomfortable. You want better options, here you go.  The living room in Chandler, my wine cellar in Ahwatukee, postino in Arcadia, 5th and wine in Old Towne, kazimierz in Old Towne, and terroir wine pub in N Scottsdale.  Been to all of them and all significantly better.    Tons more on Yelp. Postino is supposedly opening where grainbelt used to be across from Joes BBQ in downtown Gilbert so when thats there a local joint should be available."
5,"The single best ribs Ive ever had at any restaurant.  This place is brand new and off to a great start.  The mac and cheese was delicious, the bone marrow was great (as usual) and the staff and chef were friendly and helpful.  Ill be back here!"
1,"I went here because all my friends were peeing their pants about how good it is. Wrong.  The slow (perhaps retarted) staff with no customer service, alongside the barely mediocre tasting pizza both contributed to my disdain for this awful eatery. Fuck it...stick to Slices."
3,"Oh, Sushi Brokers...what happened to you?! This used to be my go-to place for great ambience and delish sushi.  We ate there Friday night for the first time in a long time and they have significantly raised their prices and the sushi was subpar at best! $90 for 3 rolls and 3 cocktails. Grrrr....frustrating!"
4,A few co-workers and I were in town for a conference and decided to check out this place on a Tuesday for lunch.  Service was fast and the sandwiches were good.  The bread was fresh...I would suggest splitting because a whole sandwich is just too much for a regular appetite.
5,"Fantastic place!  we went tonight for my friends birthday-they were able to seat 15 of us without a problem.  Our waiter, Tim, was fantastic-he split the checks for everyone before we even asked.  They gave the birthday girl two pieces of delicious dessert on the house.  The food was great-we were all surprised by how large the portions were for the price.  Everyone was very polite and accommodating I look forward to going back!"
3,"Yes, I can agree it is not perfect, but at least they are trying to do something different.  I didnt eat there and since I was a designated driver I only had soda.  I really enjoyed the stand up.  It is a great place to see some local performers start their career."
4,"Ive tried 4-5 different reflexology places in the East Valley as well as numerous professional massage places (like Massage Envy which is much pricier and kind of hit and miss) and Relax Station is the place Im sticking with. (See ya later Massage Envy!) It looks unimpressive from the outside, but I like that it is very clean and unsketchy, and they have private rooms (some reflexology places Ive been to put you in a huge room with like 10 other people which feels a little strange). Theyve always done a great job, and the price is reasonable (30$/hour) compared to other places in the area (cheapest Ive found is 28$ at other places with a coupon). They also give you a full bottle of water when you finish. They also take walk-ins or reservations, and Ive never had trouble getting in when I want to. Relax Station has definitely become MY massage place, I usually end up going every 3 or 4 weeks."
3,"A little disappointed...  We have been waiting for the right moment to visit this place and today turned out to be that day.  First of all, the location is in the middle of what looks to be a ghost town.  The interior had a lot of character with items like the family owned John Deer tractor ;)  Anyway, we had the full slab with 2 sides, a bottle of ginger beer and a drink.  Honestly, I expected more from this place.  The meat was dry, bland and over done.  My bf and I both agreed that our fav in Arizona is still Famous Daves where pay pretty much the same price, get to sit and relax while they serve you, and the food is better.   *Location = kinda out there *Price = for a cafeteria style bbq....I think its a little much *Food = its not all that...at least to us *Decor = very classic and full of character *** I just received a really nice message from the owner, Joe.  I think its wonderful that Joe cares about each customers comments and reviews.  Even though my review was not a very positive one, Joe was polite and very kind.  Thank you Joe and I think Im definitely gonna persuade my bf to try your restaurant again :)***"
1,"beware of the hidden  65 cent surcharge per person for tea even if you dont drink tea?  really. The crazy thing is, im sure no one even notices the extra cost because who checks the bill? When I mentioned it to the cashier, she was stuttering and stammering and started to back pedal and said  ""oh, is this your 1st time?  we can remove it from the bill"" I said forget it, keep it. i usually tip 20-30% but ill just let them keep their meager 65 per charge.   yeah, really worth losing a customer for? my 4 year old daughter even gets the gratuitus tea party charge and she only drinks water. gone are the $2.15 per item flat rate (can you say bait and switch?) $2.35 PER so now theyre no different from the rest of the dim sum places. as sneaky as C-FOO trying to strong arm the 15% gratuity (which failed miserably and lost us and about 100 of our friends as customers) so in a down economy, youre supposed to raise your prices and sneak in stealthy surcharges? its the chinese way i guess back to china king for us.  sorry china king for being disloyal with having a brief and sordid affair with the palace. will you forgive us? haha"
3,"07/25/11 I have a new crush... and its Christophers Restaurants pizza!   Ive been holding onto a restaurant.com gift certificate Id purchased to use at Crush Lounge for a long time now and decided it was time to use it.  I arrived w/ high expectations, of both the ambience and the food, and I wasnt disappointed... much.  The service was a bit spotty at times- we were immediately greeted when we entered and were seated quickly, but the wait that came after water delivery was a bit long at a time when there were no other guests seated around us.  (Perhaps there were other guests seated elsewhere, but they werent seated at the lounge, at the food bar, nor outside... Indeed, it seemed like were were the only ones in the room, besides the cooks at the open kitchen area, the servers, and the bartenders.)  Bread was delivered, but we were each given only one one-inch slice of a baguette.  How strange, especially when the butter cup held enough butter to spread over a whole loaf!  Whatever...  Two of the three dinner specials were relayed to us, w/ the promise of coming back to tell me about the scallop dish, but when our server finally came back ten or so minutes later, he asked if we were ready to order, so I had to remind him about the scallop entree... What was in it, and how was it prepared, and how much?  Hmmm, maybe he was ready to go home... Came in w/ Mom, so we had to try the calamari.  I also chose the Duck confit, goat cheese, and fig pizza.  For dessert, we had the profiteroles.  I really liked the calamaris coating-- lightly battered and fried golden-brown.  My fave pieces of the squid are also my Moms fave, the tentacles, so these were soon finished.  At least half of the remaining pieces, the sliced bodies, were undercooked-- poor value for the $12 menu price tag (and I was charged $13 on the ticket).  The pizza* was TERRIFIC!  Loved the semolina thin crust, and the duck confit gave the entree a great smoky flavor-- I thought perhaps there were lardons included in this dish too, but all the smokiness came from the duck.  Mmmm.... The goat cheese was very creamy, and there were lovely chopped figs all over the place-- Id order this pizza again in a heartbeat!  The profiteroles were fantastic, as well.  Three sliced choux pastry rounds, filled w/ dark chocolate sorbet, vanilla, and chocolate ice cream, sat on a pretty display made of chocolate ganache and creme anglaise, whole blackberries and blueberries, and a sliced strawberry.  More ganache was poured over the top of one profiterole upon presentation.  I asked if I could have more ganache, and our server quickly obliged-- thank you!!  We loved the crisped flakiness of the pastry (so perfect!), and out of the three flavors, we liked the fudgy dark chocolate sorbet the most.  I tell you, if I couldve licked the plate clean, I would have.  :)  Excellent dessert-- I totally recommend! (*Pizza reheats well!  Still lovely in flavor and just as crispy as it was when it was first delivered.  Cant wait to go back and try the other varieties!  Happy hour UYE, anyone?)"
5,"Finally, a great place to get breakfast that isnt Dennys or iHop in Gilbert. Came here with my family and we just made it before the change in menus.  The griddle bread pudding was AMAZING! Probably the highlight of the meal. We also ordered the veggie sandwich, All-American breakfast (?), a slice of red velvet cake.   We have definitely found our go-to Breakfast joint when my sister and I, both come back to Gilbert to visit the Rents."
3,"I met up with a few ladies here for drinks a few weeks back at the suggestion of someone else. We didnt end up playing pool, just enjoyed our drinks at the bar before moving over to a table. We were definitely over dressed and probably out of place, but it was a chill place to let loose. Drinks were okay, food was nothing outstanding, prices were to be expected."
4,Fun place for breakfast.  Prices were reasonable and food was good.
4,"Surprisingly well organized displays for a location that regularly gets mauled by roving packs of shoppers.  Great sales and service, a pretty solid seasonal selection but not as comprehensive as some of the larger Anthropologies out there. The person who lays out the stuff at this store seems to space out the perfume bombs at a wider spacing so sensitive noses may be less battered by this store than some others in the Valley. The clearance racks are gold mines for sizes 8+. They occasionally have shoes, bags and swim items being sold at clearance there from in-store returns.   ( Ladies 0-6 can enjoy amazing clearance picks at the Val Vista and US-60 location! That location also has stock from previous seasons since it is so far out of the way of the typical Anthropologie shopper.)"
1,"Youll feel like you stepped in a time machine and landed in 1987.  The decor hasnt been updated in at least 20 years.  Looks like its falling apart.  The TVs are mostly 80s style TVs as well, although there are a couple flat screens as well.  This is where the trash hangs out, of all colors.  The pizza was greasy (which I like) but also chewy (which was gross).  The wings were drowned so much in sauce you couldnt find them.  Might as well get a glass of honey bbq sauce and drink it straight.  Service was interesting.  The guy that worked there was wearing capri pants and had a higher voice than my girlfriend.  The price wasnt bad- I think it was like $22 for a large pizza, wings and 2 sodas.  Id rather pay a little bit more and just go to Upper Crust pIzza down the street."
4,"Pupusas?? As a hardcore Mexican food enthusiast I was intrigued by the concept but barely able to figure out how this fascinating dish was pronounced.  I am proud to say that I am a HUGE fan of pupusas now.   Salvadoreno popped up in a search of mine to find a low-key, nice Sunday night place to relax and enjoy some food.  It definitely was worth the visit to an interesting part of Mesa. The restaurant is very similar to a lot of Mexican food restaurants anyone who has lived in Phoenix will be familiar with.  One room with several tables and a counter with interestingly-named dishes posted behind it.  The waitress was very friendly, but I will say that knowing a little Spanish helped.  My girlfriend and I both ordered the Pupusa combo platter, real risky based on other reviews - I know.  I went with Pollo and the revuelta mixed with pork, cheese and beans.  She had the chicken as well with carne asada.  This little dish is fantastic!  I think next time Ill just stick with getting two pupusas because I was extremely full and did NOT need to add rice and beans to the mix (although those were good too.) The only disappointment was the fact that Independence Day was on the TV in Spanish, but the volume was too far down to hear.  Id love to hear the voice-over actor for Will Smith busting out a ""Bienvenidos a Tierra, P***!"" On a more serious note, I look forward to heading back here as soon as possible.  Id love to try the Ceviche, as its on the Best of Phoenix list, and there are a few other dishes (think breakfast) that looked intriguing."
4,"I really wanted to have a Birthday cake for Zoeys 4th Birthday and The Bone Appetit Bakery did not disappoint.  With just 24 hour notice I was able to choose a bone shaped cake from one of 2 sizes, I chose the small (see pics) A very tasty Peanut Butter and Honey cake with cream cheese frosting. All natural human grade ingredients, no sugar, salt or additives, Zoey went nuts for it!  I also purchased her a cute little party hat to wear for her birthday (see pics) they even sell invitations if you are planning a big doggy bash! ;-)  Your dog would just Love it if you brought home a Birthday cake for them, or even some of the house made baked treats they sell here.  Go Now!"
2,"This was my first time visiting Tandoori Times.  After seeing it advertised on Groupon, I thought Id give it a try.  My friend and I decided to go for lunch to celebrate her birthday.  It was very busy, which was promising.  The waitress was on her second day working there and was unfamiliar with the menu, but she was friendly.   The house salad was mediocre, the entree (Algoo Gobi) was delicious, but the desserts were AWFUL.  The ""mango"" ice cream was a neon orange and tasted nothing like mango, or any flavor of ice cream Id ever tasted actually (kinda vanilla, kinda puke).  YUCK.  The rice pudding was not worth eating either.   The worst part of the experience was being followed out into the parking lot, after leaving the Groupon and cash tip, to be told that we needed to come speak with management about not ordering at least $40 worth of food!  Really?  I told the waiter that we had spent just over $30, and we obviously didnt expect any cash back from the $40 Groupon.  He said his manager was ""fussy"" and wouldnt like it.  I basically told him that was too damn bad, and that I wasnt ordering $10 more in food; I was actually kinda saving them $10!  He finally figured out what I was saying and left us alone.  I did end up calling the manager though, who was not pleased to hear about our experience with the dumb waiter.  I dont foresee returning there."
4,"Just had an early dinner with the kids tonight (kids eat free from 3-6pm btw).  I had the prime rib and my wife had the fish special, kids had the mac and cheese. All were great meals. The reason to go here is to sit on the patio, its fantastic!  Not impressed that at 5:30pm I had to valet, when Im with the family, Id just rather park and walk (needed to walk off the prime rib and wine anyways!).  This place is not cheap, and with $18 glasses of wine, there is no happy hour at the restaurant!"
5,"I am totally addicted to this place. Tons of flavors of smoothies, and perfectly cooked Boba. Green Tea, or even Vanilla Chi - so far all the flavors Ive tried have been fantastic."
4,Great lean pastrami and cole slaw. Marble rye and challah were a little bland and dry. I always appreciate diet Dr. Browns cream soda. Overall good lunch spot and handy location.
5,"The Thai menu is totally amazing!  I had the Panang; and the coconut curry was to die for.  I have been mistakenly driving past this wonderful place for a year.  Do yourself a favor, try Na Rai, you will be so pleased  you did.  They have a lunch menu as well."
4,"True Food Kitchen claims to not be a health-food restaurant, rather a place for great food that just so happens to be healthy. Whatever you want to call it, when you sit down, youll be handed a card explaining nutrition guru Dr. Andrew Weils food philosophies and explaining their ingredients and food items until you no longer have an appetite. However, give this place a chance - its not all about health at the sacrifice of flavor. The decor perfectly highlights the culinary concept, with clean, modern lines, big open windows, and LOTS of green. Andrews Elixir, one of their refresher drinks, was delightful. The best food item we had was the caramelized onion tart appetizer, with gorgonzola cheese, black figs, and caramelized onions on a crispy flat crust. It was the perfect balance of the sweet mild onions and sweet figs with savory cheese and light, crispy crust. Our server said this is the same crust as their pizzas, so next time Id like to try those. Next, we had the edamame dumplings, which is basically steamed won tons filled with pureed edamame in a light miso broth. These were good, not great. For our entree, we ordered the black cod, but we had to send it back because it was so fishy (and undercooked). When I asked the server if the fish is fresh or fresh-frozen, he said, ""Well, theyre all fresh-frozen."" Their fish entrees are $22, which seems inexpensive, but theyre fairly small portions. For that kind of price in this type of restaurant, I would expect fresh fish. Perhaps the fresh-frozen fish is a cost-cutting measure in what seems to be the increasingly corporate Sam Fox empire. We went with the salmon instead, which was also undercooked but far less fishy. The roasted apples and pureed celery root were lovely, but the dish as a whole was a little overpowered by the mustard sauce, and the accompanying vegetables were weird. Prices overall are very reasonable, especially if you stick with appetizers, salads, pizzas, and sandwiches. True Food aims for the lofty goal of making great cuisine that just so happens to be extremely healthy, and occasionally misses the mark, but I give them credit for bringing Dr. Andrew Weils philosophies on the importance of nutrition for the body and mind to the mainstream."
2,to make a long story short --- we had a coupon for this place.  We know its an ASU hang out but the coupon was for spend 50.00 get 25.00 off.  Ok service was not good --- when we got the bill the pizza and wings were charged separate -- not right -- it was a together order per the menu.  We had a pitcher of beer and a single beer plus food -- bill was almost 70.00 -- we gave the waitress the coupon -- she had to change the bill for the pizza and wings --- then she came back and stated the coupon had a 18% gratuity and service charge of 13.59.  Based on what ???  that actually ate up the coupon and we ended up paying full price anyway.  Never again --- and the food was fair --- not a good place to return to -- ASU take it away -- its all yours -----
4,"This place was real chill last night. I had been to the one in Downtown Phoenix quite a few times before and wasnt all to impressed, but this location is a whole nother animal. Plenty of space to do you. Something so rare in cramped up tiny Scottsdale. Crowd was alright and the bartenders were super nice. Might have to swing through the next time I hit up Scottsdale."
4,"I will tell you exactly why this place is so great. This place will blow your mind.  Not only is the service good, but the food is amazing.   Here is the rub, your friends are drunk and they start babbling on about wanting to go to some Mexican food restaurant that inevitably ends in the letters ____bertos.  It does not matter which, they all are basically the same.  You go and get your gut injected with evil and then are forced to deal with that for 10-12 hours. Talk about regret. Dont do it.  Like a child of abuse, you have the power to stop the cycle. Say ""Nah"" Like the famous sunglasses kid, ""Lets go to Mi Patio and have some fantastic food, amazing service, and keep drinking to boot.""  You will be a hero. You will make Ironman look like AquaMan (Hes a Chump.  ""You sir, command that fish into this taco."").  Short list of amazing things to be had here: 1. Margaritas. 2. Mi Patio Taco. Not a taco and not a burrito. What is it? 3. The Chips and Salsa  4. Chicken Tacos.   5.  Ice Tea.  6. Pacifico"
5,"After writing the review the other day I had a taste for Pappas. So I went last night and YA-HUMMEE! I tried something new the Hudson platter and this baby did not disappoint! Perfectly grilled scallops, 2 succulent and sweet lobster tails, 4 huge shrimp brochette. If you are not familiar with shrimp brochette it is shrimp stuffed with Monterey jack cheese and a sliver of Jalapeno, wrapped in bacon and char -grilled. DELICIOUSNESS! It is served with the fabulous dirty rice and sauteed green beans all for are you ready for this wait for it 22.95!  I also indulged in sharing a little pecan sweet potato pie with Hagen daas vanilla ice cream and bourbon sauce. WOOHOO! FYI all deserts purchased until July 26th will have a portion of the proceeds go to a local food bank!  Dinner last night was sooo freakin good I may be back tonight! Bon Appetite"
5,"The Culinary Dropout , you get the best of both worlds. The food is off the hook (its great) ,the service, these ladies and guys take care of your every need, and as a added bonus you have some of the best performers in Phoenix, entertaining you while you dinne.....Check it out....Bluesman Mike"
5,"Incredibly good calzones; friendly service, nice courtyard seating."
3,"We were visiting again, so of course that means at least 2 trips to Sugar Bowl!  The food, service and ice cream were good as always, but WOW, the prices sure have gone up.  I know that the economy sucks, but for what we got, the prices just dont seem to justify it.  We had different waitresses both times.  The fist was efficient but not very warm.  We had Sandra on our second visit - and YES, she remembered us again!  Could not believe it.  She is very friendly and can really keep up when they get swamped.  We will be back, but maybe only once per visit instead of 2 (or 3 or 4) times.  Just cant afford those prices for what you get."
3,"I would give this place 3.5 stars.  The service was excellent and the view of Pheonix at sunset was nice.  I ate the wedge salad (nothing special) and the chorizo mac and cheese (yummy).  The highlight for me was the pudding trio, the honey date flan was delicious but the portion was small...which led me to savor every bite.  The other people in my party were satisfied with their food and there were no complaints."
4,"I loved this place.  It was a little pricey but all the stuff in it had some kind of paperwork.  The paperwork explained about the materials used. I thought the lady who worked there was nice.  Dont skip go in---even if you dont buy you can soak up a little astmosphere,"
3,"They are known for their CARNE ASASDA and it  does rock but dang this place was nickle and diming me at every turn!   Everything is ala carte, and the tacos are so small,3 bites and its done. For the price tag it should at least come with a small bag of chips. Honestly the chips were so average it was disappointing. the salsa that comes with it was mediocre considering the hold out factor applied.   The salsa that came with my  tacos was exceptional, that should be their signature salsa for everything. Sodas by the can, no refills,,geezzz,, another 3.00 bucks later. I think I ended up spending over $12 for 3 small tacos and small basket of chips, and 2 sodas in z can.  For that price,  I want more atmosphere or at least a 4 bite taco."
4,"I was pleasantly surprised to find the Phoenix Public Market across the parking deck from the Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication. Its too bad its not located on the ground floor of the school, replacing the space currently occupied by Subway. It would be much healthier for the students. I had their breakfast protein shake, which was AWESOME! Even though it was $6, I ended up having TWO! While the shop is not as big as a Whole Foods, it does provide the organic and healthy staples, while serving fresh salads, pastries, and different types of chocolates. I didnt get to purchase the local bran of organic ice cream, which seems to be popular. Maybe next time Im back in Phoenix. I also liked their little coffee shop in the back room, which is separate from the main shopping area, giving you a bit of quiet to read a book or check your email. Lastly, all the staff are quirky, yet incredibly friendly. They offered up suggestions for local things to do, and were generally helpful. Overall, love this place. I wish it a long and successful life. The world needs more Phoenix Urban Markets."
3,"Its not in a shell gas station anymore and i guarantee that Guy would never visit the new location on his show. I ordered the El Pastor burrito and i didnt like it at all, very dry and just not to my liking. I would never order it again but Im sure there are alot of people out there that like it. The salsa was great and i couldnt get enough of it. I ate half of a bean and cheese burrito and i really liked that also, not the greatest tortillas ever but they are possibly #3. I would could back and id like to try some other type of burrito or some carne asada tacos."
4,"The drive to the top is really fun, and the view is worth it. I really enjoyed it here, but theres too much freakin broken glass on any of the trails down near the main shade/view structure that you should realy avoid it if you have your dogs with you and stick to the more wilderness areas. 30 other reviews = TLDR (i just learned that one, see how Im applying) so Id rather be brief and useful than wordy and redundant. I did read Chuck Rs review, and I have to say, I wish I knew more of the nooks and crannys that you do, but I can tell you that if you want to explore the Western reaches of the park, do so by starting in the center or east, and not to bother with approaching from the West side of the mountain range itself.  All youll find out there is a bunch of paranoid, possesive property owners who didnt stop to think that if they chose to own a home on a ribbon of private land that surrounds public land and restricts the public from getting to their public land, then theyll have to endure a little bit of traffic from said public.  Heres a clue for any of those property owners, whether youre on South Mountain, Piestewa, wherever....the guy sneaking around is the one you call the cops on for being a suspicious trespasser, not the guy driving a family suv with 2 dogs in the back, who calls you from the street as he sees you in your driveway so he can ask directions on how to get to the park entrance so he doesnt have to bother you nice people in the residential neighborhood anymore driving around here.    ah, duh."
5,"Great Pizza. Great Service. Weve been here a few times since it opened. And always look forward to going. We have never had a bad experience. Each time has been great. Our waiter Dave was perfect, always on the ball."
2,"This is one of those reviews where a qualifier is required.  It seems like everybody that gives this transit system a good rating is a Phoenix native.  That makes this, like so many other things, good for Phoenix.  The problem is that its terrible compared to nearly every other metro system in North America and absolutely abysmal compared to more progressive parts of the world. This is quite possible the slowest train that I have ever ridden in my life.  It seems to make stops every two blocks and it take far too long to get anywhere.  Factor in the terrible hours of operation and youre going to easily find yourself stranded at one end or the other after a night at the bar. Please work on expanding the routes and hours, speeding up the trains and then maybe youll be able to increase ridership.  Im a huge fan of mass transit but this train falls far short of expectations."
3,"Came for a friends birthday and really was not that impressed. First of all, it took us a while to find parking as this place only has street parking and a few spots in back. On Saturday if you are there before 7pm, all alcohol was 1/2 off and some appetizers were on special. We ate dinner there and the menu was very limited. The food was okay, but our burgers were over cooked. The service was slow and it took us a while to get our check. Id go to hang out again and have a few drinks, but I wouldnt suggest making this your regular hang out."
2,"Five Guys is great for those days when you want to spend $12 on a glorified fast-food hamburger. The meat comes in a wafer-thin patty, and doesnt really taste like anything, just like at Wendys. The bun tastes mass-produced.  I also dont especially care for their fries, although this is a matter of taste more than anything. Im not generally one for mushy, thick, ""natural"" fries of the sort served here.  I cant help but wonder if people rate this place purely on the quantity of food that you get. The normal size for the burger is a double-patty, and the fries come overflowing from a 12 oz. drink cup.  I would rank the burger places around mill as: 1) Smashburger, for their delicious Arizona burger, and the awesome smash fries 2) Chuckbox, for delicious char-grilled meat that actually tastes like meat 3) In-n-out, for great-tasting meat and some of my favorite fries 4) Five Guys, 5) Fatburger, seriously why the fuck does anyone eat at Fatburger?"
2,The buns fall apart so you end up eating your burger with a soggy bun.  Staff does not seem to know what is going on and they are not well trained.  Cant think on their own.
4,"I go here for the free wifi and the bleu cheese crumble salad. Thats it. Bleu cheese, craisins, sunflower seeds all on a bed of romaine. LOVE IT. I dont think Ive ever had anything else on the menu, now that I think about it. Free wifi will get me in every time, thats for sure! I chose this location because I was in Phoenix in-between activities, and didnt want to drive back to Gilbert. This was at the Biltmore, and yeah, you knew you were in a Paradise Bakery at the Biltmore. Kind of funny actually. What can I say? I like to people-watch. :-)"
3,Pretty decent food. Friendliness of staff is hit or miss.
4,"Go Go here for happy hour! From 4-7pm you can delight in their half priced apps and specialty cocktails. Their sushi rolls are meh, but their teriyaki ribs are falling off the bone, finger lickin good! The cocktails seem to be concocted for little Asian girls (which is odd since there are no Asian girls in Scottsdale, especially now that my BFF and I are gone) - fruity with cutesy names like ""Hello Kitty,"" ""Harajuku Lover,"" ""Shiso Horny,"" and ""Kinki Kooler"" just to name a few. My favorite was the ""Turning Japanese"" which was like biting into a vodka infused pear. Service at the bar was wonderful - Victoria is the one of the cutest bartenders in Old Town (guys, go pay her a visit). Drinks were flowing and the food came out quickly. In addition to the happy hour and Victoria, make sure you check out their restrooms and private karaoke rooms, complete with ""entertainment"" poles. If you end up spending a long time on their Toto toilets, people will understand why. Seat warmer and a bidet? Youll want to take your business there on a daily basis."
5,"dr. matsumoto and her team are the best!  she came recommended to me by a friend who also goes there.  they truly care about the WHOLE child and not just their medical care.  we have seen 3 of the pediatricians in the office and they have all been great.  we developed a special bond with Dr. Miller during a very lengthy health issue with my son.  its a 45 minute drive for us now that weve moved, but we still make the drive  to see dr.  miller because we  trust her to make the right decisions and offer the best advice for my childs health."
5,"This place is awesome. Affordable, tasty food.  Simple and clean country environment."
4,"When one course of a meal is so significantly better than the rest of it, its hard to write a balanced review.  I went down to Cheuvront with a few friends for Restaurant Week.  The place is tiny, very relaxed-hip looking, and right on Central Ave.  While the place doesnt have any distinct look or theme going on, there was a movie with french subtitles playing on a screen next to the dining area so...I guess its supposed to be French.  They have wine and cheese too, so, yeah, probably French. So the meal didnt start out so great.  The spinach salad came out to me on a dirty place.  Sure, its a restaurant.  I know other people use the same plates and silverware Im using, but things like that, especially when noticed, are off-putting.  Unfortunately, the ahi tuna that followed was also overdone.  Not in a bad way, and I almost didnt notice through the thick peppercorn crusting, but when it was pointed out, I was a little disappointed. That was when they pulled out dessert. Im not a sweets person.  I dont know that Ive ever been.  Give me spicy or savory 10 times out of 10 over any kind of sweet-tasting anything.  Although my dentist might argue evidence to the contrary, I really just dont have a sweet tooth.  That being said, I wanted to die and be entombed in the citrus flan that was put in front of me.  I wanted to lick the plate clean and then go back to the kitchen and demand they fill my pockets, one with the smooth, creamy, more-like-custard-than-flan flan and the other with the wonderfully sweet and subtle citrus sauce they coated the dish with.  Id also probably ask for some of the figs and berries to be put in a doggie bag. I have never, in my entire life, enjoyed a dessert as much as this one.  I would happily drive the 20-plus minutes downtown just to have this again. Before I forget or the keyboard shorts out from me drooling, the wine selection here is also amazing.  I didnt take time to look at the whole thing, but I think most wine connoisseurs would be happy here. While it was a mixed bag, the place certainly deserves another trip.  I can see (if I had a real life, not one that consisted solely of studying) sitting out on their patio, enjoying Phoenix, and making a dent in their wine and cheese stocks."
5,I have been eating at this Waffle house since I was a teenager and it has never failed to provide good food.  The employees are courteous and the service is fast.  The portions are good for the price and the small dinner feel is great to eat in.  I have gone here many times with my disabled brother and have never had any problems with the staff or employees.  I also like the fact that they are one of the few 24 hr restaurants available to eat at and this has come in handy many times.
5,"We stopped here on a Thursday night on a raving referral and they we not exaggerating - this place is fantastic! We are always a little hesitant to try a new place when an omnivore suggests it, but as vegetarians, we found Sekong by Night so accommodating! They offered to convert nearly any dish on their menu into a vegan alternative, and it was delicious. The spring rolls are really big, and they swapped their fish dipping sauce for a vegan version. We had the Phnom Penh Noodle Soup with tofu & veggie broth (just like the Vietnamese pho!) and the Katheaw Cha rice noodles with tofu instead of beef - AMAZING.  Service was top notch, and as many other reviewers noted their prices are unbelievably low for the quantity and quality of food that you get. Looking forward to our next visit and trying more fantastic dishes!"
3,"Ruby Tuesdays salad bar and healthier choices (With caloric count for calorie counters) for entrees is what sets it apart from other chain restaurants that serve your basic American style cuisine.  The salad bar includes 2 types of base greens (Iceberg and mixed greens), with various toppings (Edamame, peas, mushrooms, croutons etc.) and dressings (Italian, low fat balsamic, ranch, thousand island, etc).   Generally, with any main entree, you will have your choice of side and salad bar, or 2 sides.  They also have more healthy side options such as roasted spaghetti squash and steamed broccoli.  My husband had the chicken trio, and I had the creole fish on our visit.  The chicken was nicely presented, and was fairly tender and juicy.  Of the three different toppings (Balsamic and tomato, mushroom cheese, and mango salsa), my least favorite was the mango salsa since the mango in it, while fresh, wasnt totally ripe.  The creole fish was presented in a Spartan way, with just one piece of fish with a mound of side next to it on a plain white plate.  The fish (Some type of white fish, maybe carp?) was a freshwater white-flesh fish and had a decent seasoning and was cooked well.  Service was friendly, but we did not have any silverware on our table when we were seated and had to ask for it after our entrees were served to us.  Drinks were refilled quickly as needed. I havent indulged in a lot of the desserts, but I am a fan of the Italian creme cake.  Its moist, and not too sweet.   Prices are moderate, and entrees will be around 15 dollars, give or take a few dollars."
3,"I remember when this place first opened.  I was very excited since it seemed so ""humbling"". I came here for lunch and thought this place actually looks ""okay"" at best.  Chicken Sandwich was excellent.  The bread was toasty and crunchy, while the Chicken and toppings were warm and buttery!  However, the soup can improve.  They only gave to you 2 options so I guess I had a 50/50 chance of getting the good one!   The place was loud and popping!  Not sure what to make of it since they had wine racks and wine, but then teeny hot pink tank tops hanging from the wines.  Is this supposed to make me want to drink more wine or should I buy a shirt for my GF?  Though I dont think anyone would appreciate a shirt that says PIE.   Service was good, I guess.  Our waiter was very nice and helpful, but he seemed flustered with a smile.  He didnt do anything wrong by any means except he was going about 100 more miles than I was.  - Enjoy"
2,"Its ok, quality . Service was below par, although they were really busy. Fries were good and endless I guess thats good.. But, I was looking for a good burger, too bad I didnt find it here."
4,"I seriously love this store. I wish I didnt live so close because I always find myself here without even realizing it.  I can always find something here that is awesome. I pretty much never leave empty-handed. They have some really great deals and prices on clothes, shoes, accesories and purses. Their high end stuff is still kind of ridiculous though. But that could just be my broke-ass opinion."
5,"I LOVE this place..  This is my sushi bar.  Danny, one of the two sushi chefs is awesome.  I have always found their sushi to be very fresh. About a year ago they came out with a special sushi menu.  With rolls like these: Dirty Harry, Mr. Miagi, Rio, you cannot go wrong.  Especially if you like spicy (like me)! Even the non-sushi is great.  This is one place my 6 year old loves that doesnt have a drive through window. Also, $4.50 sake bombs!!!  $4.50! Go here.  Try it.  Dont be scared off by a couple of so-so (ok, 1 bad) reviews.  I am looking to even have a UYE here in the near future!  Should be getting a call tomorrow to get it scheduled. Almost forgot!  They have some big screen TVs!  Watch sports here!  They are hugely popular for UFC fights and football..   Just go.  Now..  Seriously.  Review part is over..  You are wasting time reading the fodder I have written here.  You could be finding your keys..  Putting on socks and shoes..  Hell, skip the socks..  Wear sandals.  Save time."
3,"Harkins 16 is exactly like every other Harkins theater.  That it to say, a huge, context-less concrete box in the middle of the desert that shows the same movies as their competitors.  I saw the Simpsons movie here tonight and just have a few thoughts to share. -The Cine Capri screen is big.  Anyone who has visited either the Scottsdale location or now-defunct Camelback relic knows this, but I felt it was worth repeating.  Very cool to see a movie on a screen larger than life itself. -There is always ""that guy"" in the theater.  You know, the one that laughs as loud as a bullhorn, repeats everything that happens on-screen, and occasionally yells out something profane or derogatory.  Now, imagine a theater where every guy is ""that guy.""  If it werent for the cool factor of the huge screen and seeing a movie Ive been waiting to see since childhood, I would have walked out in annoyance.  Seriously, what compels people to behave like this?  I dont know if this is due to the proximity to ASU (beefneck central), but it sucked. -Previously mentioned by another reviewer, but Dippin Dots are awesome.  Simply awesome. Getting out of the parking lot was a disaster.  I dont know if the whole Tempe Marketplace complex could be more poorly designed."
2,"Dropped by for a manicure, and as soon as I sat down, my manicurist started talking in rapid Vietnamese. I couldnt see her headset so I thought she was speaking to me, but obviously she wasnt. In fact, she never looked at me during the lightning fast manicure, except in confusion when I said I didnt want her to cut my cuticles -- just push them back. She really didnt understand that, and asked me in broken English why I was getting a manicure but not getting my cuticles cut. She didnt have an attitude about it, but was just really confused. I think after that exchange, she told whoever was on her phone about it. I also thought it was strange that she asked me to wash my hands after giving me a lotioned hand massage -- sort of defeats the purpose of applying lotion to my hands in the first place?  The whole experience was perfunctory, but didnt leave me wanting to return for a manicure. Not asking for a great nail technician, but it would have been nice if she acknowledged my existence other than doing my nails, and most importantly if she asked whether I wanted them cut round or square because I wanted them round!  I would have interrupted her phone conversation to let her know my preference, but she was so fast to dunk my hands back into the soaking dish that I didnt see what they looked like!"
5,"i love this place. very rarely do i get to go out and tie one on. when i do, this is were i want to be at some point in the night. where else can i go and request the cramps? i...love...this...place, it makes me happy. i suppose i should go on and on about what its like, but i wont. go and experience it for yourself."
5,"This is our favorite breakfast place. The food is good. They have the best biscuits & gravy of any restaurant I have eaten at. The wait staff is friendly. The only complaint I have is that Sunday mornings are packed, so there can be a wait to be seated."
1,"I will be moving to Phoenix in the Winter and I thought Id scout out some LFS while I was visiting, which led me to Reef Culture. At first I was positive seeing some nice looking displays and LED use, however this soon changed.  On closer inspection, lots of the tanks were infested with aiptasia and bubble algae, and prices of coral were hugely inflated compared to other prices in the area and back home. The people were very unprofessional and unfriendly and first ignored me entirely despite trying to flag someone down. When I did manage to get their attention, I was belittled and treated like a child who knew nothing about the hobby (I have had marine tanks for over a decade ranging from large 55 gallon+ to tiny DIY LED picos).  After this rude and demeaning experience, I continued to peruse the last few tanks and came across an angler fish. I watched him and he followed me as I walked down the isle as far as his tank would go and I backtracked a couple steps, amused that he was slowly walking along the tank with me. There was a loud crack as the man behind the counter slammed the phone down, snapped his fingers at me, and told me to ""stop harassing the fish."" Keep in mind, I was not tapping on glass or prodding anything as I am quite short and I could barely reach to the high up tank where the angler fish was, much less reach to ""harass"" any fish. After this rude treatment I promptly left. This kind of unprofessional treatment of the customers is shocking and unacceptable, not to mention the bubble algae infested tanks (one spore of that on the water that you get your coral in and your tank is infected too).  I wont be doing business here when I move."
1,"After bad experience, I will never return.  It is terrible since they didnt meet my expectation and the price is outrageous.  The most difficult part of the Pho is the broth (req 16 hours of preparation) and it tasted like water.  I had to add all kind of condiments to rescue it but cant even eat it.  The restaurant is very slow now and it confirmed what I meant with Asian restaurant.  If your fellow Asians dont patronize the place, it is  because your food did not meet our expectation.  Try across the street to the Rice plate Kim Thanh for their rice dish.  It is night and day."
1,"MY EXPECTATIONS WERE EXCEEDED!  Ive been searching for so long to have a dinner experience that MET all of my expectations - for a restaurant that I SHOULD NEVER PATRONIZE.  Mimis in Goodyear actually exceeded my expectations.  On Oct 26th, while visiting the area, I made the unfortunate mistake of recommending we dine at Mimis because of previously good food and service there.  But, alas, if the old Mimis quality still existed, they wouldnt have exceeded my expectations for WHAT NOT to experience in a restaurant. Let me recant why YOU or ANY ONE ELSE (except those people you truly dislike) should never patronize this facility.  First of all, the interior temperature was at least 80 degrees (when it was less than 65 outside).  We had to ask for the air conditioning to be turned on. Next, we ordered the artichoke dip appetizer.  It looked funny.  It tasted funny.  The tortilla chips actually resembled pita chips.  If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it must be a ______. I ordered the chicken cordon bleu which is supposed to be served with ""seasonal vegetables"" and ""homemade mashed potatoes"".  Can someone explain to me how MIXED seasonal vegetables can be served where the brocolli is steaming hot, but the carrots mixed with them are literally still frozen in the middle?  Thats a feat.  My ""homemade"" mashed potatoes?  Cold.  A sliver of butter placed on top of the mashed potatoes would not even melt to graphically show our waitress ""the problem"" .  Even after this effort, no offer from the wait staff (or manager-missing-in-action) was ever made to either warm up the potatoes, replace them ......or, perhaps, use them as wall spackling. After all this, they sincerely asked us if ""everything was all right"" and ""would we care to order dessert"".  At least they have a sense of humor. Never again."
5,"Roka Akor has a classy atmosphere, and a slightly formidable menu to pick from. Everything looks so good, and in a new environment, I want to try it all! But my date and I, after much deliberation, decided to ""go for broke"", as it were and if we couldnt finish, at least we had a good sample of the menu.   For an appetizer, we got the butterfish tataki and the burnt red tomato salad. These were yummy little tidbits that disappeared off the plate quickly. The butterfish was delicate, and the salad was great - the greens had all sorts of different flavors, and not that ""generic clump of lettuce"" flavor I hate.  From the sushi menu, I was feeling adventurous and had never had raw red meat before, so I ordered the wagyu gunkan. My date saw the amount of green onions piled on top of this dish and oh-so-chivalrously gave me his piece. Its true that you needed a healthy appreciation of green onion to like these as served. The wagyu beef is ground nearly to a puree - which I wasnt expecting, and I thought the onion was a bit much.  At for the skewers we ordered, my date liked his sweet potatoes the best, but I was partial to the crispy BBQ. These turned out to be two large ovoid and solid shapes of rice, run through with a skewer. Pure white sushi rice in the center, the outside was caramelized with what tasted like the sweet BBQ sauce that comes on eel sushi, which gave the whole thing a nice, crispy shell.  At this point, I got to what I consider to be the crowning achievement of the meal: the yuzu marinated black cod. The cod, cooked on the robata grill in a leaf, was meltingly soft and delicately flavored. It was an effort to be share fairly. I believe my date said after our first taste of it, ""Just eat what you want and Ill finish ..."",  I looked up from my chopsticks, ""... you know what? Just cut me off half.""  I wasnt sure that I could handle dessert after eating so much, but we finally decided it wouldnt be fair not to give the dessert menu a looking over, right? So we ordered the baked green tea custard, and it was a perfect pick after a gut-busting meal. Light and airy, it also had some carbonation to it that tickled my taste buds and made me giggle a lot as I was eating it.   Our sampler of shochu ranged from impressive to harsh, at least to my taste buds. In order starting with least harsh: pineapple, honeycomb, raspberry, and apple. I didnt like the last two, but the pineapple was, in my mind, a fairly dangerous thing to drink when youre not paying attention. Smooth.  Thats it for the food, and as for the service, it was swift and considerate; glasses were kept full, and empty plates whisked away. There was, however, one glaring exception that nearly overpowered the entire evening with its oddness. The waiter, who had up till this point been very nice and chatty, helpful about menu items, and generally a pretty cool guy, handed me his phone number and told us to call him any time we wanted to go partying.   What am I supposed to do with this? Are we going to call our waiter up and say ... well, what? It flummoxed me."
3,"The food here is good. Its not outstanding, or anything to write home about, but it IS tasty.   The whole making a tortilla in front of your eyes seems a little kitch-y to me, but so what? Everyone has to have a marketing ploy. Ive eaten in, and taken out, and the burrito quality is about the same.  Personally, I like Chipotle better, as I like the dressing on their veggie salad. My one beef (amusing, since I only get the beans) is that they were a little too light handed with everything. I got hardly any guacamole or sour cream, and that is really what helps to make a delicious tasty burrito of goodness in my eyes. Will I go back? Certainly, if its on my way and Im hungry. Will I choose to seek it out? Probably not."
5,R.T. OSullivans really hit the spot! The service and the atmosphere were outstanding. We were put into the back room which was perfect for our large group of 45 plus. The server kept track of everything even as people moved around and socialized. The food was wonderful.  We will be going back!
1,"I was so happy to see another station in the neighborhood.  I went in to fill up as I usually do at any station unaware that I was paying TEN CENTS MORE PER GALLON (than Circle K)  because I wasnt paying cash or using a Shell credit card.  Yes, there are signs on the pump but, really, who would think to look for such a requirement?  Ive been buying gas for over 40years and have never seen such a non-cash penalty.  I, and my children, their spouses and our friends will not be getting gas there ever again.  How disappointing and dishonest."
5,"Super friendly. Joe was there greeting everyone, refilling coffee, and sharing how we uses local Arizona suppliers. Great diner food and decor. Loved the biscuits and chorizo gravy.  Will definitely be back."
5,"Im giving Bobby Q an extra star in this update to my previous review, because although it has its share of hits and misses, it is, in fact, as good as it gets in Phoenix for great barbecue. I love barbecue. It is a hobby of mine. When I get stuck on something and want to know what it should look and taste like, I go to Bobby Q and am almost never disappointed. Most recently, this happened with beef brisket. Im going to upload a picture I took of Bobby Qs brisket because seriously, if you look at it and dont want to immediately die from desire, then you just dont like barbecue. If I had anything bad at all to say about Bobby Q, it would be that sometimes their meats can be slightly overdone but this is not the norm. Their quality control, considering how much food they must serve to keep up with the demand, is astounding.  Their prices are too high, but of course, youre paying for the almost Disney-esque atmosphere. Their sauce is absolutely delicious (although it should be noted: they dont understand what ""spicy"" means). All in all I really cant say enough good things about this place. Go look at my brisket photo. Seriously."
5,"I was in Bomberos for breakfast this morning, and I was told they now carry Coca Lite!  So much better than Diet Coke - I had no idea I could find it anywhere in the US!  How great is that? Also, Bomberos is now using MJ Breads and Tammie Co pastries... not too shabby, huh?"
1,"Great at first, then the bartender ignored me and my friends for a good 20-30 minutes, put everyones bill on my tab. I opened a tab so this wouldnt happen then they made us wait another 15 for them just to ask us who had what. Then they over charged us by quit a bit. We had to flag someone f=down from napkins and plates and it took a few trys for a water. And to make matters worse my friend got a parking ticket because they took so long. There were three bartenders for what I handle myself at a bar on a daily basis. No sorry from any of them and not even a drip of regret from the manager. He pretty much told us to chill out after this whole 45 min waiting or deal, just to close a check. Kind of a joke really."
2,"The new Frys in the burbs are awesome, but this old relic is pretty bad. Ugly with a with a smaller selection, plus staff who pass you in the aisles (when youre obviously looking for something) without asking if they can help. If youre in this neighborhood, head over to the nearby Safeway."
2,I really wasnt impressed with the service or the food.
5,"This was my first experience with Lush (with many more to follow).  I stumbled into the store because I could smell it 4 stores down, and I was drawn in by the aroma (I dont even thing I read the name on the sign...I just followed my nose).  I had never seen anything like it!  The giant blocks of soap, the colorful bath-bombs, the bubble bars (that looked like little cakes), and so much more!  It was late December, so the sales staff told me that any left-over Christmas items were buy 1 get 2 free (what a deal on my first visit!).  They demonstrated a bath bomb for me, and I was MESMERIZED!  I got 6 Christmas bath bombs (4 of them for free!) and 3 travel-sized Snow Fairy shower gels (another Christmas product, and by far one of my favorite Lush products EVER).  I also got some non-holiday bath bombs and melts because they were just too heavenly to pass up (I got a Youki Hi bath bomb, my favorite bath bomb ever, which was sadly discontinued sometime last year).  I also got my first piece of Lush soap (Sexy Peel. all the citrus just makes me smile when I use this soap. Its sunshine in your shower) Since I used to work in the mall I would go into Lush whenever I had a break and get a couple things, and the staff always recognized me :) They even offered me a hand-cream sample one day when I was complaining of dry hands.  I brought some of my friends from school in and told the girl behind the counter that they were newbies, so she rushed out from behind the counter to demonstrate EVERYTHING in the store!  Literally, she showed us bath bombs, bubble bars, face cleansers and toners, massage bars, and dusting powders.  I was so impressed by her powder demo that I bought some Candy Fluff dusting powder (another item that has since been discontinued.  Vanilla Puff powder is a nice substitute). This store holds a special place in my heart because it was the first Lush store I ever went to, and I will forever have fond memories of the staff that dazzled me, and every time I smell Sexy Peel Soap or SnowFairy Shower Gel I am reminded of that magical day :)"
4,"We were exceptionally sun deprived by the time March came around, so that may have swayed my review to be exceptionally sunny.  I was pleasantly surprised by the FLW inspired architecture (I didnt do any research on the hotel-my husband picked it) and by the beautiful grounds. Our room was very comfortable but we spent the majority of our time at the pool or on the  patio relaxing.  It is definitely not 5 star service across the board, but no one was rude. Our room wasnt cleaned the entire 3 days we were there, even after we asked the front desk to send housekeeping. That didnt get us down--after all, we didnt come there to hang out in our room. At Frank and Alberts, the staff gladly switched the TV to the game we wanted to watch and the food was great."
5,"Any time I have out of town visitors who want ""real"" Mexican, I take them here. The chips are fresh, the salsa is divine, and after downing two baskets, you realize you need to eat an entree! Ive eaten a variety off the menu, and nothing has disappointed me. The burros are stuffed full, the crisps are mouthwatering and the enchiladas melt in your mouth. The ONLY downside is the location. Just not a great part of town, though they are trying very hard to revitalize it. Go there anyway! Just try lunch time first."
5,"Zin, zin, zin - Yes, yes, yes! Several weeks ago five of us had a wonderful Monday evening at Zinburger with our delightful server, Candace. I arrived early, inquiring about the Left handed Polestar Pilsner, Candace offered a sample, very tasty - with three of my party eventually having it with dinner.  We had a great booth - giving us a vantage point, watching the parade of customers & employees. I really like the airy, roomy, high energy vibe. With our drinks we had the delicious zucchini fires with two sauces an a subtle breading on the zucchini. We all tried different burgers, with some of us tasting each others, Candace made the split arrangements prior to serving us - nice touch. The meat is flavorful, melting in your mouth with a freshly baked bun. Fun, cool atmosphere & great food - made for a great get away, early in the week. My hats off to the Sam Fox team, another winner at ZinBurger."
1,"Buca Di Beppo is literally, italian restaurant hell. You know how all big box chain restaurants throw junk up on the walls in an attempt to make the space feel vintage? Buca Di Beppo throws junk, and knick knacks and statues and anything else italian they could find in the chinese warehouse where they loaded up these goods. Its a terrible horrible mess and you end up sitting in a yardsale of italian paraphenalia while eating your very bland pasta. Its embarassing how truly flavorless the food is here. Thin, flavorless alfredo sauce. Thick slabs of lasagna with less taste than what I can get out of the frozen section at Publix. I went with a large group and across the table, bland food. When they seat your party, they guide you through the kitchen area where the cooks play along and say a welcoming hello. Deep down you know they hate this. Why are we in the kitchen? Sure its nice, but Id rather have them concentrating on making the food, and making it good. Of course, the food at Buca Di Beppo seems to be far beyond any point of return to tasting good. Its just dead. Dead food. No life, no flavor, not emotion. I get more flavor from the $.99 Michelinas frozen lunch package. Far from claiming anything authentic Italian, Buca Di Beppo even pumps out bread with no taste. Eating at Buca is like eating food from an assisted living facility. No salt, no sugar, no butter, no fat, its all gone along with anything resembling taste. Sure, Buca has huge portions, and the setup is nice for large parties and families - but they might as well just buy the family-size pasta packs from the frozen section and bake it at home, even that would be better, and they wouldnt have to the mandatory gratuity. Say what you will about other italian chains like Macaroni Grill, or Olive Garden - at least their food taste like something."
2,"Ate here months ago.  Was excited to finally find a Phoenix sushi venue, and one that also offered brown rice as a sub for sushi dishes (dont quote me on this however, since it has been many months and I may be recalling another venue).   One item did impress me, and that was the complimentary appetizer that was comprised of tempurad chips with perhaps a squid salad topping (?)  I should have just ordered another serving of this!  Instead, I tried an Ao Yasai (mixed gourmet greens with ginger) and a sushi roll w/ brown rice, the latter I thought was price-y considering the very small portion given.  I was so unimpressed by its unexciting flavors that I dont even recall what kind of roll I tried!  Pretty sad, I know.   I told myself I wouldnt go back, but I would like to give Hana another try, perhaps for lunch and/or dinner with a group of friends and have apps and wine/sake!"
4,"Wow, this was one of the best dinners I have had in a long time. I definitely have my favorite spots but it is rare that I have an entree that knocks my socks off. For me, this was the gnocchi dish with the shitake dijon cream sauce. My husband was surprised that I ordered this, since I dont like mushrooms, and luckily for me, the extent of the mushrooms were some medium ones in the sauce. The gnocchi were very tender and the sauce was rich and creamy. I felt like I was eating a delicious mac & cheese with some soft foccaccia bread. OMG. We also ordered the porteguese style mussels that were a fave of my husbands. They were just okay to me but overall, were decent. We also ordered the chorizo and manchego risotto that I really liked. We each had a glass of wine. Our server was kind enough to let me sample the prosecco before I ordered it. Good thing I did because I didnt like it. The server asked what kind of wine I liked and then brought me a taste of their white blend which I enjoyed. Overall, before tip, our bill was $50. Very reasonable for three plates and two glasses of wine.  This place is extremely small inside with 4-6 small table inside and 3-4 tables on their patio. There were two servers and on a busy Fri night, service was slow. But they were very nice and apologetic, so I gave them a break. I noticed the kitchen staff worked extremely efficiently which is a plus for such a small space. I was very impressed. I cannot WAIT to come back here as there were several plates that looked amazing."
4,"Was here awhile back and Sharon Hs review will sum it for atmosphere but i will try and cover my feelings on the taste. The bruchetta is great. Yeah really that simple. I havent tried much but bruchetta here but havent really been disappointed either. Even the ones that ""havent been a fan of"" of the ones i tried when i have mixed and matched when getting to select I still would order over bruchetta at most places as they are still very good. Did try a pizza once and wasnt amazed but nothing stood out (its been awhile since that). The bruchetta however comes to mind every time i hear the word. Oh and the service is very friendly and attentive. One night I was in and they had just finished a major catering event and it had said on the front door that the kitchen was going to be slow until about the time we arrived. Yet when we ordered and it took a bit to get the food (barely a delay in my book and if I hadnt been apologized to by the waiter probably wouldnt have know it was longer than normal) we got a nice little discount."
5,I eat here often and the lunch special is great!!  Food and service are equally good.  Fries are to die for.
5,"I really like this place...  Taking the advice of Yelp we stopped in on our way through downtown.  We were immediately greeted as we walked in. I told the staff it was our first time in and asked which sandwich was the best.  Following the recommendation I ordered the Crackerjack, cracked pepper turkey and melted pepper jack cheese with lettuce, tomato, onion and Russian dressing. We also ordered the Godfather, cappicola, salami, pepperoni and melted mozzarella on garlic toasted bread.  Lets take a moment and show the bread some much deserved love. It tastes fresh with a chewy center and crisp exterior covered in sesame seeds. You could put a shoe on this bread and it would taste great.  I really enjoyed the Crackerjack. The Godfather was good for a few bites, but too rich for me.  I cant wait to come back...  Great choice for lunch downtown for a very fair price.  Unless you are completely starving, share a sandwich!"
4,"Great burgers and menu offerings.  You would expect to get a good burger with a name like that and you do.  The sweet potato fries, Frenched fried onions, and Salmon Salad are very good too.   The decor, location, and menu are restaurant alternative for the area.   The menu was a little confusing and little pricey yet the quality of the food is there and considering the location of the restaurant pricing isnt an issue.   I do recommend to restaurant to others."
4,"Shopping around TMP made me thirsty for a cocktail.  There is some type of Cantina I passed by that did not look relaxing so I went to my Yelp app to see what else was around when I saw the Thirsty Lion.  I was expecting an English pub-like atmosphere and I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in and saw the clean and modern decor.  I sat at the bar, a great thing about this place is that it has HH on the weekends!  The bartender wasnt that great.  He just threw down a drink coaster and walked off.... uh... really?  When he came back around I ordered a specialty drink - mint and cucumber cooler or something like that - I was hoping for more cucumber than mint but the mint was overwhelming, it tasted more like a mint julep.  They did have a great selection of beers on tap but I really wanted a cocktail so the next round was a jack and coke.   I wasnt planning to eat but I noticed some hard-boiled eggs wrapped in sausage on the HH menu, I had to try those, its not often that I see something unique on a menu.  They were pretty good actually. I cant wait to come back."
4,"Ive always had consistent quality of food and service here.   Standard menu....everything is a la carte.  Ive been to this specific location about half a dozen times.... I recommend City Hall or Mastros (N. Scottsdale), over Mortons.  But between Flemings and here, its a tossup.  I would eat at either....but I would probably choose Flemings over Mortons."
5,"The best ! From my first shredded beef taco almost a year ago  ..i have been lovin this place. I also love the number 13 combo platter (.Mini beef chimis ,Gauc ,rice and beans)  The tacos are 5 star fresh and yum ! ... AND reasonably priced."
3,If I hadnt recently found Yogurtland in Scottsdale I would be raving about this place. Unfortunately it is  45 cents an ounce and the other place is 30 cents. Both have a nice variety of flavors but this place is missing the water cooler. You do get a bit sticky from eating your treat. There is something they have that yogurtland doesnt have. They have marshmallow and peanut butter in squeeze containers which is to die for!!
4,"I love this Starbucks. We all know every Starbucks is expensive, so forget that. But these people have our drinks memorized, if you go there alot anyways, theyre on top. Good Starbucks."
5,lululemon is the best clothing store to hit Scottsdale since Ross.  Even though exercise shorts there cost more than an evening in Tijuana they are worth every penny. So what if the pants there cost $160? They are awesome. Would Batman ever question Alfred about how much he paid for the Batmobile? No. Because the Batmobile is awesome and Batman would have paid any price for it.  The mens side of the store doesnt carry a wide collection but what I did find was more magical than the sorting hat at Hogwarts. Everything is so comfortable and if youre overweight most of the pants and shorts have elastic so you dont look like a muffin when you put them on.  I also like the workers there too. They are friendly and helpful and helped me understand that even if I liked some of the womens shirts there it would not be a good idea for me to purchase one and wear it. But I love teal I cried!  If you havent been to lululemon that probably means you hate small animals.
4,"We went to Christophers with the Deal Chicken 3-course dinner.  The food was very good and the service was just as good.  The lobster bisque was a bit too thin for my taste and is something I would pass on in the future. The lamb was delicious and the tuna salad was tasty as well.  We opted to order dessert and the mousse tower was delicious.  We were saddened that they did not have the grand marnier souffle on the night we went, which was highly recommended.  Will return!"
5,"I have been Chipotle faithful for about 2 years now, and it wasnt very difficult.  Restaurants such as Rubios and the Blue Burrito just didnt stack up to a Chipotle burrito.  Then came Qdoba. This restaurant is pretty much a carbon copy of Chipotle (2 of the employees on duty actually worked at my former Chipotle of choice).  I had a chicken burrito (my Chipotle norm) so I could make as direct of a comparison as possible.   The food was great, and afterwards I didnt get that ""punched in the stomach"" feeling that Chipotle gives me for some time after I eat it (I am convinced their rice expands in your stomach, but it tastes good so I suffer through it).   I also picked up their frequent customer swipe card (buy 10 burritos get one free + free chips and salsa after activation).  This place is closer to my place than any Chipotle, so I will be coming very often!  P.S. If anyone if privy to the correct pronunciation let me know! (ku-doh-ba???)"
4,"Saketini opened not too long ago, so theyre still having grand opening specials.  Get em while theyre hot! I havent had their food yet, but I have partaked in their fantastic drink specials.  They have $2 well drinks for happy hour.  Woo hoo! Plus they have a reverse happy hour too, which scores them another star.  Any place that offers late night drink and food specials is alright in my book.  Once I try the food, Ill be back and Ill update the review."
3,"This is your run-of-the-mill sports bar that caters to the not-so-blue-collar 30something crowd of Chandler.  The ambiance is nice, darker, big screen TVs everywhere... the waitresses are attractive (a staple at these types of places) and they are friendly and attentive... ours was on this very day.   Its Beer Week in AZ this week and they had just hosted a SanTan event (pub crawl) today as part of Beer Week, so they were understandably out of SanTan Devils Ale and the place was quite quiet when we arrived at 5pm. We got seated at the patio where the have a nice little Bocce ball area and it was nice to enjoy the great Phx February weather. Alright, so we ordered burgers as we were both in the mood for a sizable piece of beef, hopefully topped with bacon and other yummies.  They did a pretty good job for being a sports bar, but not impressive. They claim their meat is fresh ground, though when thats the case, the patty has a different type of form and is less flat and compacted.. okay, maybe they grind it in the AM and then stockpile patties for the day.. thats fine.  The bacon (I ordered the #9 All Star - cheddar, bacon, beef) was lame... thin, a bit stale-tasting, and not crispy.  The cheese was fine.  I did like that the meat was char-broiled and so it has a good taste to it.  Also, the inside wasnt over cooked and the bread they served it on was kinda sweet and giant... tasty, actually. The sides were blaaaah.. cole slaw was really boring and had literally 3 ingredients (white cabbage, carrots, sugary mayo) something I would expect from Chilis or Dennys. Well, the burger hit the spot but the rest was plain and boring.  The Stella was not as cold as I prefer.  Our staff was very good.  So far, an OK place to visit, but a 4 star place is somewhere I will likely go out of my way to visit.. this didnt make the cut."
5,"I had heard many great things about Penzeys, but it wasnt until recently that I actually went to the store. After shopping around and smelling various spices, I wanted to buy everything in the store! Great for gifts as well!"
5,"I took my daughter there to get her nose pierced for her birthday, they were very nice and professional and made her feel comfortable.  Its a nice shop and they were very friendly and did a great job.  I will definitely recommend them!"
5,"Been twice. Authentic, high quality & great price for what you get. Salsa de Chile de Arbol was the best!! Loved the decor. Orchata tasted fresh, which is a rarity in most Mexican Restaurants."
4,"This cute little neighborhood breakfast/lunch spot just opened up, and is the sister restaurant to Tuck Shop.  The menu is small with super reasonable prices!!  Not much in the way of vegan fare, but I managed to find a tasty dish: The Red Flannel Hash (beet, potato and root vegetable hash sans eggs).  It was very tasty and had a nice amount of black pepper in it.  I also ordered a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice for a grand total $8 and change.  Not too shabby for brekky.   My dining cohorts ordered a frittata topped with sour cream and chives, a Portuguese doughnut and biscuits stuffed with some kind of meat (I forget the name of this dish) and were equally pleased with their meal. Not sure about parking, as we walked over (so awesome!) from their house.  This is a quaint little gem with indoor and outdoor seating.  They also have booze, so you can add a little pizazz to your wake up call.   Great place, cant wait to come back!"
2,"Carls has raised the price on its food so that the $6 burger is now actually almost $6. The big marketing ploy here was that you could get a burger for just a few dollars that was the same quality as what other places charge $6 for. Not anymore. Additionally, they have not resolved the issue of employees that speak so little English that they are unable to either take or execute your order correctly. We have emailed Carls in the past regarding this issue and are just tired of having to bring it to their attention when they get the order wrong (which is most times now).  We have now decided to just go across the street to the In N Out burger at Fiesta Mall for any future burger runs. You can get a burger for half the price and the employees speak English and can get your order right."
5,"A burger? With anything I want? FINE....Ill do it. I need no convincing for a burger, fries and a coke (Thanks Carls Jr.)  Earleir this afternoon, after a heavy morning of househunting with a couple realtors, I decided to sit my fat backside at a table and eat. And eat well. I stumbled into the Five Guys at the Fashion Square mall. Not sure how long its been open. Perhaps it was the grand opening? It was PACKED! But I digress. As soon as you get to this location in the food court of the mall, youll realize that this is not your typical burger joint. They have their own seating separate from the mall-commoners. And their own bathrooms (CLEAN) You get to the counter and you see a sign telling you about the potatoes they are using for the fries you will be eating. Ordering your burger isnt a gong show. Fairly easy. All the toppings are listed and all toppings are FREE! My food was delicious. Got a burger with some of my favorite toppings: onions, tomatoes, etc.  The fries reminded me of an experience I had back in high school, when I held a girls hand for the first time. Soft, perfect and lovely. Thats how these fries felt. Ok that sounded weird. Tough. Oh, I forgot to mention that the soda fountains had COKE ZERO!! EFFING AWESOME! I MEAN THIS IS THE MOST DOPE SODA EVER!!  (Im really hoping this Kanye yelping phase ends soon, since my reviews make me seem like a bigger Jackass than I seem in person). Ultimately, I left this place happy, satisfied and I will come back again. Oh...the answer to the one question in everyones mind? YES, BETTER THAN IN-N-OUT!"
5,"Warning, dont get deterred that there arent any seats for you when you walk in... thats a good sign that the the tables are full with everyone stuffing their faces.  I waited for about 15 minutes for a table to free up, and Im glad I did.  It was kind of a chilly night and I was feeling for something hot.  I decided on the seafood noodle soup and pork pies.  The noodles soup broth was lightly seasoned with a hint of white pepper (just the way I like it), the noodles were thick and hearty, and the portion was substantial.  The pork pies (3) were like a flattened pot sticker that had been pan-fried on both sides, Yum! Definitely, a place serving up genuine Chinese food with the finesse of a home-cooked meal. I cant wait to go back!"
4,"I tried Pork on a Fork at the ASU Tempe farmers market. Beef brisket and pulled pork sandwiches were sold there in a small tent. My sandwich (brisket) was very tasty, albeit a little plain (just meat and bread). There were three great BBQ sauces available - sweet/mild, tart, and spicy. I used a lot of all three, but spicy was the best. I felt like I could drink those sauces! At $6-8, the sandwiches are a little pricey, but they are filling and taste excellent. It would be nice if they came with some corn, beans, or the like to round out the meal."
1,"After a day full of meetings, I gathered the hubster and we headed out to eat some Mexican. I had visions of chips/salsa, and margaritas. We headed to On the Border on Stapley near Baseline but found that this location had closed. Egads. Then we remembered The Salty Senorita across the street. And thus begins the saga. ""Hi, are you here for happy hour?"". We said no but were seated in the bar area anyway. At least we got a booth. Lucky us, huh? Joe ""lots of product in his hair"" brought us menus and took our drink orders. He was pushing a certain type of Tequila and I took the bait, with the stipulation ""on the rocks with salt"". My drink, and hubsters water arrived and we ordered. The chips and salsa AND our dinners arrived at the same time. .Really Joe product??? Chips with the meal? FYI, chips and salsa here arent complimentary, you have to order and pay for them. It was then we noticed ants had taken over our table. At first we thought it was just a couple but noooooooo. The hubster brought the ants to the attention of Joe product and he feigned concern but did not offer to sit us at another table. Now the hubsters getting annoyed. Its hard to enjoy yourself when you are swashing ants off the table. Our booth was by a window but we didnt see any influx from the window of ants, so were not sure where they are coming from, but they dont stop. Hubster mentions it a second time, and then, again with feigned concern he offers to move us to a different table. By this time we are almost done eating and I just say lets finish and get the hell out of dodge. Our bill comes, we pay, and hubster asks for the manager. Hell, hes even younger than Joe Product and looks like he just woke up, thus well call him Bed Head. Bed Head offers to buy us a drink on the house? Really? Thats your solution? He said hed make sure other patrons arent seated in this area. Egads, no thanks, we just wanted to leave. We werent after free food, but the offer of 10% off or some kind of compensation for sharing our entire meal with ants would have been appreciated. A free drink? Hey,maybe one of those $60.00 margaritas would have made everything alright! As far as the food goes-I had the chicken antchiladas (get it, lol) with beans and rice and they were dry. I like my enchiladas with oodles of sauce and cheese, and these had very little sauce with a little design of sour cream on them. Hubster had a steak and avocado salad. He said it was ok.  This is a never return place for us.  And a note to Joe Product-chips and salsa should have arrived WITH the drinks, and before the meal.Reflecting back, we were there on Earth day so perhaps having ants share our meal was relevant. The margarita gets a 7 out of 10 limes as it was pretty good."
5,"Finally, well-qualified, well-established mechanics that dont talk to me like Im a dumb, car-ignorant girl - even if I am. I was sitting at a desk establishing an estimate for my Honda within 20 minutes of calling them. The receptionist was polite and efficient, but truly the best part was their interactive, transparent estimate process. I was able to view the screen as my estimator drag and dropped the parts he suspected I would need into a spreadsheet. Then, I saw him calculate the labor hours - something I had NEVER been privy to before. Tracys Auto Body was affordable, very quick and went above and beyond - alerting me to other pieces that were loose and fixing them for free. I highly recommended their services. They have a perfect record since the mid-1980s with BBB and with good reason."
3,"They dont have the lunch specials on the menu or tell you about them if you dont ask, so make sure to ask. The sandwiches dont come with fries and their fries are over priced for not being very good. The pulled pork sandwich is good and so is the sauce. Also, expect a long wait especially if people are ahead of you."
3,"Alright, so here is my two cents on Brat Haus. I suggest to steer clear of the brats I tried (Beer Brat & Spicy Thai).  I found them a bit dry and bland.  I also found the pretzels less than fabulous. I do suggest to try to big, juicy, tasty, meatballs. Much better choice. The outside patio very cool, an open fresh space with plenty of seating and a big ol wall of funky art. The service was also friendly, and attentive and fair prices. Overall, its totally worth checking out if you are in the area and in the mood for something different."
3,"Lets start with an SAT-type question: Scottsdale Stadium :: AT&T Park is like _______ :: Oakland Coliseum. a) Oakland As b) Rickey Henderson c) Phoenix Municipal Stadium d) Yankee Stadium If you answered C, you, my friend are correct.  And youre pretty smart, too.  Give yourself a pat on the back. Much like Oakland Coliseum, Phoenix Muni wont amaze you with state-of-the-art facilities, breathtaking views or spectacular nightlife nearby.  What you get here is a functional, simple, 40-year-old ballpark that serves its purpose.  The crowds here are much smaller than you would encounter at other parks, but it fits 6000-7000 people comfortably.  Unless you are in the premium infield seats, you will be sitting on the aluminum benches or on the grassy knoll.  Pick your poison, so to speak. We always get the infield seats, because you can sit 12 rows behind home plate for under $20.  I dont care how bad the economy is, its a steal!  Even if you sit directly behind home plate, you will most likely struggle to see the tiny outdated scoreboard screen in the centerfield.   There are no fancy food choices at Phoenix Muni.  If youre not intimidated by enormous wieners, a footlong hot dog might be for you.  Believe me when I say, you will not be able to eat more than two, no matter how much you love hot dogs.  I am also a fan of the little dining area by the left field foul pole.  You can sit there at a table with a giant umbrella, hide from the sun and sip your beverage of choice.  If youre lucky, you can even watch the game from some of those seats. The people who work here, from ushers to concession stand clerks, are incredibly nice.  They really do want to make sure you have a great time at the game, and it shows. Parking here is very easy.  For $5, you can park in the lot right across the street.  The lot rarely gets full, and you can always almost find a spot.  I hear there are ways to find free parking if you are willing to walk a little more, but at $5, why would you?  Its important to know, though, that the walk from the lot ""across the street"" from the ballpark will take you about 7 minutes.  There is no crosswalk on the street, and you have to use that ridiculous pedestrian bridge they erected with the sole purpose of annoying most baseball fans. So, +1 star for great seats, +1 star for cheap parking, -1 star for horrible scoreboard, -1 star for the pedestrian bridge.  A-OK, 3 stars."
2,"I travel a lot for business and usually stay in Hampton Inns.  This one less than impressed me.  First and foremost, it is a motel.  The door to the rooms open to the outside, which is not typical of a Hampton Inn. I was concerned to stay in such a hotel at first since I am a woman traveling alone.  The area is ok, and the hotel area seems to be pretty safe and well lit. The lobby and pool area are very pretty, but again...the doors open to the outside so when I was positioned right near the pool, I could hear everything that went on.  The bed was standard Hampton Inn bed (comfy) but the room was small.  My biggest complaint, by far, is how bad the noise carries.  Im still sitting in the room and I can hear the entire conversation going on next door...I can make out every single word.  Additionally, I can hear the person upstairs.  Their sound insulation is terrible.  There is a gap around my door (and remember, it opens to the outside) so can hear everything that goes on outside, too.  Theyve done a nice job of spiffying it up, but I did not find it to be appropriate for a business traveler."
4,We had a great meal here! I started with the cheap salad as I was craving salad.  HIt the spot. Hubby started with smashed irishman drink and loved.  He moved onto a draft beer. I moved onto Fish and Chips-they were light and just the right size. Hubby had beef stroganoff-he said it was tasty. We ended with the fabulous salted caramel-my fav thing of the night. I think the bill was $62 before tip-pretty reasonable to me.
3,"The service was great! We had a large group & had called prior to make a reservation. Our table was ready when we arrived & they had assigned 2 servers. They were both incredibly pleasant & attentive. Our food came out really quickly & no one had any complaints. I wouldnt say this was authentic Mexican food, but it doesnt have to be. A good time was had by all :)"
4,"This was my first time to Sekong By Night.  I have had Khmer food before, which is ironic, as my wife is from Vietnam, but never had Khmer food from Cambodia.  She has to come to the USA to experience Khmer food!!  I have eaten Khmer food in San Francisco CA, and in Siem Reap. Both my wife and I were pleasantly surprised with Sekong By Night.  It looks like a tiny little forgettable restaurant from outside on the street, but once you step inside. you can see the owner put some thought into the decor.  It really looks Asian.  It is as though the owner went on a shopping trip to Phnum Penh and came back with tons of artwork for the place.   The Amok fish is really nice.  Reminded me of a cafe I had dinner at in Siem Reap some 9 years ago when I was seeing Angkor.  The fish was fresh.  My wife wanted to switch with me (she ordered the Katheaw Cha).   The Katheaw Cha is also very good.   I ordered a Coconut Juice as my drink expecting it to be canned.  It was fresh, and smelled fresh (a pleasant surprise!!!) My wife ordered the Grass Jelly drink, and it was also good.   I really wish that this place was in Mesa AZ, as I would go more often.  Maybe so, I will make the drive again to this place from Mesa as appropriate.  This place was a pleasant surprise and I wish the owner great success.  I want this restaurant to succeed.   The only place where the Khmer food was better (for me) was Siem Reap, but then it is perhaps a little unfair to compare a restaurant in the USA to what really is available in Cambodia."
2,"Just not a great Sushi Roku location.  The service was okay and the ambience was too - but the food wasnt fabulous and the sushi chef knew very little of the food he was serving.  When sitting at the sushi bar in a fine dining japanese restaurant you kind of expect the chefs to be spot on and knowlegable about the food.  Not the case here.  If you want to spend this kind of money, go to Roka Akur - its fantastic and worth every penny."
2,"My wife and I were looking for a dinette table. We looked at many places and ended up at the RoomStore. We found a great table and decided to purchase the item.  The salesman was nice and didnt provide too much pressure.  There is a LARGE selection of items-couches, tables, chairs, dressers etc. My problem was that we bought the table and had a deferred pickup due to moving into a new home several weeks down the road. I placed a small down payment to reserve my item. After several weeks, I contacted the RoomStore to pick up my item since I just moved into my new home. My item was not in stock and was told to call back later in the week. I called 4 days later and was informed the item was now available.  Today, I went to pay the balance of my purchase and take home the table. Small problem, the table and chairs are not at this location.  I was given the choice to pick up the item at the distribution center 30 minutes away or wait until until Tuesday. I wish that during my several contacts during this process that someone would have told me that I wouldnt be able to pick up my item here or wait several other days. I was not happy! Now I have to go back once again to pick up the table and chairs."
5,Great food!!! The French dip is to die for!! Great Service! Clean and fancy especially for the area its located in!  Def a hidden gem! My husband and I both love going here and cant wait until next time.
5,"Humdinger!   What more is there to say.  Its the best sandwich ever.  It tastes even better on the weekends when Kids Eat FREE!  If you have a larger family ( more than 2 kids ), this is the best deli in town."
3,"The food and drinks are blah, but the service is always great! Happy hour and trivia are always fun at Skip & Jans."
5,Im usually one to prefer chicken - but when the only option for tacos is steak you go with it.  I ordered the taco and was rewarded with tender steak with lots of flavor.  Our lunch crew has gone back several times and the service is always fast and friendly.  For the size and price - order multiples.  Love the salsa bar.  Adding cucumbers is now my favorite treat.
5,"Kona grill is never a disappointment.  Sushi, the regular menu, the atmosphere.....  The staff is very friendly and the food is very good!  We like to create our own sushi dishes and the chef is always ready and willing!  I highly recommend Kona Grill for consistently good food!"
5,"A must!  One of the BEST dog food stores in the Valley!  Great service and quality, natural feed products for your dog.   You can rest at peace knowing that your pets are in GREAT hands. Mark Siebel http://www.doggiestepsdogtraining.com/"
4,"Fantastic pizza for the price! One of our favorite take-out spots. Ask for the daily special as you can usually get wings, soda and pizza for the price of a large pizza. Great deals, great prices and quick service. Not a place to go sit and eat - strictly take-out."
4,"The cookies and breakfast pastries are to die for.  Just for those two items they deserve four stars.  Everything else, however, is just OK.  The rest of their foods are good but not great.  If youve ever been to Wildflower, I think their food is better there but dang, I can go to Paradise and just pig-out on their cookies!"
3,"Dam you Doug !!! Ok, I thought I be the first but Doug beat me to it.   Any establishment that has a free happy hour for its guest is a plus nuff said. Yes -the 4th floor grill is awesome and the bar staff will give you the Ins & outs of Scottsdal-ing culture and the pizza they serve is pretty dam good- the complimentary breakfast was was actually good too.  Im not sure if they still do the free happy hour thing but what sold me on this lets say resort - is that while I was there , there was a whole bus full of girls that where promoting - some kinda of alcoholic beverage - and I heard from a good source many beverage companies uses the Chaparral as a pit stop for their promotional tours...  Word- I guess they come for the pools..."
4,Went in after a day of shopping with my mother. We walked into the bar side and decided we wanted to sit in the pew benches on the restaurant side instead. We ordered waters and sodas while munching on a side of chips. My mom got the chicken pot pie and loved the crust and the moist chicken. I got the Meat and Cheese. Although I wish the cheese was a bit more melty the sage pork sausage was great. The dipping gravy tasted of beer. Great addition. The music was fun and the bartender dancing to the music was fun. Great lunch! Will go again when Im in Tempe. Another plus: enough for left overs!
3,Cute little coffee shop. Had some tea and sat outside with my boyfriend. Enjoyed the weather and played some cards. Very relaxing.
5,"LOVE the Four Peaks. Can get crowded as hell, and parking is a bit of a cluster F, but Ive never ever not had a fun night there.  The beer is excellent, the service has always been attentive, and the food is above normal bar standards The fish and battered fries was very good, the tartar sauce is good, but ask for the cocktail sauce . . . its fantastic.  Heavy on the horseradish enough to feel it in your nose!  And the Rueben might just be the best in town. The happy hour is great.  $3 locally brewed pints?  Sign me up The location and the it being an actual brewery gives it extra points.  I had family in town this week, and I like to take out of towners to places that have a local AZ vibe.  They definitely got a taste of MY Arizona.  Next time theyll have to come during Pumpkin Porter season"
5,"Nellos is the best!  Great local feel, great food, love this place. You have to have:  (Gluten Free) Pizza, Garden Salad with Turkey and House Dressing.  It will soon be your go to feel good order."
3,"So let me start by saying the latte was very good, best Ive had in this area at least. Much better than Starbucks, even though thats not a very high standard but one that everyone can relate to.  Good atmosphere, comfortable seat and lots of it... The live music was deceiving as it looked good for the out side (dont we all) and sounded horrible (but Im not reviewing that am I) :)  I was actually helped by a guy there who matched the place well. Good service with a grin and not the overly caffeinated pep talk baristas of a certain chain often feel pressured to give. Ill be back if only for the latte."
4,"I stayed here for work and had some meetings in the area which made the location very convenient for me. I just hopped in my car and was at my office 5 minutes later. The hotel seemed pretty new-ish and there were free cookies at check in. There is also a restaurant downstairs and a gym if youre into that sort of thing. My room was clean and well kept.  My only minor complaint about the room would be that the air conditioning is super loud! There are a couple of restaurants right outside, but they close pretty early. Other than that there isnt too much close by, but if you drive up the street a few blocks to Happy Valley, you can find every big box store and chain restaurant imaginable."
4,"How this place has less than four stars is a mystery to me. I have been 5 times and have taken out of towners here 2 out of the 5 and they all left saying it was yummy too. The El Presidential Especiale is a MUST - i order 86 the onions and add machaca/shredded beef. They are a simple yummy combination with their rice and beans. This is just straight up classic mexican food - not for the snobby. So if you want a more classy joint thats less authentic - hit up ZTejas cause this place is not for you. The hot salsa in the ketchup bottles is always a sign of a great mexican joint (and its hot AND tastey - a combination not many get correct). I will say their chips can be a little on the less crunchy, more oily side but they are more than happy to replace that with some that are a little more to your liking. And their margs are delish as well. This place deserves a 4 because of consistency, friendly and accomodating atmosphere and just downright solid take on enchiladas - red sauce is spot on. Thanks Tee Pee for being our go-to for Mexican food in the Valley of the Sun!"
4,"I hate to find out that there was another location closer to where I was.  It doesnt matter because it was worth the trip.  I ordered pick up because I was by myself and wanted to a bit of exploring.  The place has a nice casual ambiance.  They also have an outdoor seating area.  I ordered the pad thai that comes with chicken and shrimp as a standard.  Since it was lunch time, it was part of the lunch menu that came with a choice of soup or salad.  I chose the soup, but was too stuffed to have it because I jumped right into the pad thai.  I ordered it medium spicy, and it was pretty spicy.  I cant imagine what hot would have tasted like.  Actually, Im more curious of what it would have tasted like in a mild flavor.  The noodles were slightly overcooked, but still flavorful.  I also had the Thai Iced Tea here, and it was perfect for the weather and a great combination with the tangy pad thai flavor.  The prices are expensive compared to Chicago, but I hear its typical for Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  My lunch speciai and drink costed me a little over $15.  I guess if you are craving it that bad like I was, youll pay the price..."
4,"4.5 Stars... I really enjoyed Becketts table! Its a large, cool looking room with exposed ceiling and brick walls. They have a small patio and I heard theyre planning to build a large patio on the side of the building.  I met a couple friends there and we shared a few different items:  The drink list has some great looking combos and a nice variety of wines. I tried the Palmaire, a lemonade/pomegranite combo. Very refreshing!  We had the grilled cheese with pancetta to start... I love a good grilled cheese and these were perfect little bites. It came with roasted red pepper tomato soup. The soup tasted like pureed roasted red peppers; I would have preferred a little more balance with tomato taste.  The roasted brussel sprouts were sumptuous; intense flavor and a little crisp on the outside.  The fire roasted green chile pork stew was very tasty. The corn bread that came with had a perfect sweet contrast. I tried a bite of my friends short rib - very tender and lean.  We ended with the creme brulee, which came with fresh blackberries. At first I passed on having bites (Im not a huge fan of creme brulee), but they pressured me into trying it... YUM! I may be a convert now.  Overall, a great pick! Shout out to Katie B. for the suggestion."
5,"Their emu oil is great.  I use it for inflammation of my jaw and shoulders, its wonderful.  I highly recommend it.  We buy it at Fresh Vitamins in Mesa.  No dyes, fully refined, I love it."
5,"We were in town on Business and Pleasure and had a chance to visit Aiellos with our Children, 10 and 7.  What a TREMENDOUS experience it was overall and then to top it all off, a chance to win ""dinner on the house"" via drawing a number out of a bucket, was simply superb.  We didnt win but will definitely come back next time we are in town as the food, staff, and overall dining experience was unbeatable!"
3,"Went here to meet up with LA friends during Superbowl weekend. The decor is pretty unique here and the bathrooms are quite the trip. Bartenders are ace, cocktail waitresses are good looking, and the music is a healthy mix of bangers and decent indie hits. Tip for the door guys there dont let in 6 dudes at a time, even if they are Persian dudes with tons of cash who want to buy bottles. Boo!"
1,"Quick spot for a mall-made mayo-based California roll. This is where you go to learn how sushi can go wrong. Youve been hard at work doing swipe-and-sign. Perhaps you even dropped a thousand bucks at Neimans on a worthless Jhane Barnes sweater and some silk-lined Zanella slacks or three thousand on a whats-left-of-last-seasons-collection of Brioni blazer. Whatever your fancy, youre toting a wrist full of roped, glossy, shooshing-sounding bags with tissue paper sticking out the tops. You just want a break and some cool refreshing sushi. Its OK, but beware. Unagi and other ""hot"" items have a ""beep-beep beep-beep"" before they get to you. California and spicy tuna rolls come real quick -- cause they come from a vat of mayonnaise. Rice is not right either. Stick to tuna and salmon sashimi and miso soup. If head chef Rick is there (think Kyoto of Empire at 24th and Camelback, then Ichi Ban, University off McClintock), ask him to make you a Fat Bob on Acid, for good ol times sake. Or just go to Starbucks, tide yourself over, and find a real sushi restaurant. And about the Brioni... Dont sweat the buyers remorse. Itll make a great tax deduction to Florences."
5,"This is an amazing taco truck just minutes from the airport. I ordered the amazing ceviche and a barbacoa burrito, while my girlfriend ordered three tacos. Ive said it before and Ill say it again here: this truck is an excellent example of the inverse correlation between price and taste in Mexican food. Eat here before your next flight!"
5,"Probably the best mall Ive ever been to. Anchored by five mega stores - Nordstrom, Nieman Marcus, Macys, Dillards and Barneys New York. Its so big, it took a couple of hours just to walk it. My wife called it the best mall shes ever been too. Nuff said."
5,"This place is absolute perfection.  From the setting to the service to the food, I loved every moment of it.  The only way I found out about this place was through Yelp.  You seriously are my trusty sidekick.  From the previous reviews I was a little worried that it might be packed, but then I remembered it was a Monday night so no worries. Walking in the restaurant, it is quite small, but just absolutely adorable.  It really does feel like an upscale country home.  Wood lines the whole restaurant and they have mini chandeliers hanging over every table.  Even the touches of place setting are just perfect. Our server was Gina and she was a complete sweetheart.  We started off with the Bohemian Sidecar and the Cucumber Vesper.  Both were absolutely delightful!  Then we moved on to appetizers, because while getting drunk is fun, I was really excited for the food.  We had the steak tartare and mussels in the saffron and white wine sauce.  I loved the steak tartare with the potato chips and fried egg on top.  Put fried egg on top of anything and Im sold.  Put fried egg on top of raw steak and Im in love!  The mussels came out just as we were finishing up the steak tartare, perfect timing!  The mussels were equally amazing if not more, and I am so sad that they only give one piece of bread!  Well that, along with the bread and butter.  But that still wasnt enough for me!  I wanted to soak up all of that saffron sauce goodness! After Gina cleared that out of our way, she brought out the glass of Bordeaux and Rhone blend.  I hate when I dont have a drink in front of me, and she made sure that never happened.  Then the entrees came.  The pork shoulder with the bacon for my bf, and the stuffed chicken with the pome puree and mushrooms for me.  Again, absolute perfection on both accounts!  I loved the mushrooms that were slightly charred and crispy, with the sauce and the puree and the chicken with goat cheese.  Im getting hungry again just writing about it.  My bf loved his, but I still maintain that mine was better.  And both of these entrees were incredibly reasonably priced at $15 and $17.  Could life get any better? Well apparently it could!  After we polished off our entrees, then came dessert and after dinner drinks!  We had the souffle which was amazing with the creme anglaise.  And the berries with the creme fraiche.  Heaven in my mouth!  We finished that off with the chocolate martini and the pear tini. This review cannot do this place justice.  This is truly a unique experience that is far above any of the restaurants in Scottsdale.  Please go in and experience this for yourself, you will not be disappointed!"
1,After moving back to the area from Cali I needed somewhere  to get my acrylics done. I usually like to get some kind of design or unique tips. After walking in I saw some tips I liked so I decided to try out this place. The first visit was bad the nail tech would not listen to the length of nails I was requesting and did a terrible job at shaping them. I always give people more than one chance so I went back and this time I got a pedicure first then the nail tech left the salon and I sat near the dryer for 45  min before approaching the manager about the length of time I had been waiting for a fill. He replied unapologetically that the tech had to leave to pick up her son from school... I sat another 15 min before I was seen by someone else. They also did a poor job. I will not spend my money somewhere that they do not value their customers. Not to mention they did a crap job and were overpriced when it came to designs and tips with prints on them. Dont waste your time here.
1,"I waited 45min and ended up with a tiny gross little serving of tortilla with vegetable scraps thrown in it, served in a aluminum take-out box. The tables are folding tables, like the kind you play beer pong on. And they have pictures of kids and babies on the walls and signs asking people to send in pictures of their kids for the walls too, which has nothing to do with Asian/Mexican cuisine, it creeped me out."
5,"OOOOOWWWEEEE!! Have yall tried ATL Wings yet!!! If not what are you waiting for!  They are the BOMB Diggity! I dont know why I havent updated my review either, so here I go!  The honey habanero are still my #1 but I also love the Cajun Hot!  Holy Crap!! Get some of the Cajun Hot wings and some ranch and their hot sauce on the side, dip your wing in the ranch and then the hot sauce and watch out!! The only time you really feel the burn is when youre no longer eating, gums & tongue just be blaze hot and mouth just be water for more, yes my friends thats the heat I love!! Luv me some wings from ATL!"
3,"Im always on the lookout for cool places to bring out of town friends and this place seemed to fit the bill.  Its a sustainable farm that produces Arizonas only extra virgin olive oil.  I came in for lunch and as I pulled into the GRAVEL parking lot my stomach turned because I had expensive heels on and knew they were going to take a beating (I know, ""waaah"" right? But there are women out there that love their shoes as much as I do and will appreciate the heads-up).  Once I entered the Olive Mill I was delighted to see how adorably quaint it was inside.  The building was split in two, market on one side, bistro on the other with seating in between both and also outside.  The market had testers of all their products, great idea but the food testers didnt seem sanitary so I didnt try anything.  I ended up buying some awesome hand balm that I love.  They had a really great wine selection as well.   Alright so heres the bad part.  The entire time I was there, not one employee greeted me or cracked a smile.   There was one guy in particular that was going back and forth stocking shelves and was visibly annoyed by my presence.  When I went to order my sandwich, I remembered I got a free drink with my Yelp check-in.  The girl at the counter sighed and rolled her eyes as I scrambled through my purse to find my iphone and she said ""forget it, I got it.""  Their sandwich the ""Kalamata"" had its 15 seconds of fame on the food network so I was going to get that but opted for the ""Lucca"" at the last second because it has brie...I love brie more than I love most family members.  The sandwich was a disappointment.  All the ingredients were there but it was devoid of any flavor and I couldnt figure out why.   I probably wont be bringing any of my homies here but I will drop by to buy products, I fully support local businesses."
5,"My husband and I have been going here for a few years now. It is one of our favorite places. Really low key, affordable, amazing food! Between the 2 of us our bill is never more than $10 and we are always stuffed! I love how casual it is and the humus cannot be beat!"
5,"Good reviews are easy to write. Stop reading this and just go eat there!  OK, well I have visited this place for years now and dont go anywhere else if I am in this area.  I like the Chefs, they are friendly and quick. They speak pretty good Spanish to me and but I dont dare try to respond in Japanese, ha ha.  The value is phenomenal, where can two people get miso soup, salad, beans, tea, ice cream and sushi rolls all for under $20?  Ive tried the same at Say Sushi in my hometown of Maricopa and cant do it for under $40 or more for two.  All you can eat is available but I find that ordering individually is more economical.  Great atmosphere for a quick lunch or a large party for dinner.  The waitresses are Asian and I find that suitable for the restaurant. Some reviews on here complain about them. I dont have any issue with them they have always treated me nice and done their job well.  I will keep coming back."
3,"I love that walking through the doors of the Sugar Bowl is like taking a step back in time but what I dont love is that it looks like it hasnt been cleaned or had any restoration work done since the day it opened. Lets be honest though, I didnt come here for the decor, I came for the ice cream.  I was very excited when I saw the sundae covered in chocolate, cherries and marshmallow creme. I love marshmallow creme and chocolate, always a recipe for success when these two ingredients are combined. Well, no luck. They were out of marshmallow creme. I got a brownie sundae instead, only ate half and decided that it was only ok.  I probably wont go back to this place. There are too many good dessert options out there. Though if my friends insisted, I would more than likely oblige."
5,"I have been coming to Lux for years ever since I started graduate school here in AZ.  What is there to say that hasnt already been said other than hands down it is my go-to coffee spot in Arizona.  Such a warm and diverse group of people, rotating artwork, the perfect study music playing in the background (although it is played a bit loud), espresso roasted on-site and baked goods made on-site.  Always find an excuse to end up there for a café au lait or a velvet if I have a sweet tooth!"
4,"As a vegetarian and sporadic health nut, I just love TJs. They have a nice array of inexpensive fresh produce, including my beloved broccolini, for 40% of what Safeway charges. Huge selection of frozen veggie-friendly dinners, good for my on-the-go household. Greek yogurt, cheap. Nice beer selection with lots of cheapo wine. I try to buy all my supplements here too, as they seem to be a lot less expensive. Yes, Im all about saving cash on groceries and whatnot. The downside? Its not one-stop-shopping; a trip always requires supplementation with another trip to a ""regular"" grocery store. This particular TJs is teeny-tiny-small, and always chock-full of obnoxious and/or oblivious people who wield carts like weapons. My favorite is the woman who thinks its an awesome time to teach little Jimmy how to push his own wee cart and comparison shop, and lets the little bastard cruise all over the store willy-nilly. Im all for giving your kid responsibility, but a) you still have to, you know, keep an eye on the kid and b) a super-crowded claustrophobic nightmare like this place after work is not, repeat, NOT the time to do so."
4,"Perfect patio for a Saturday! This place walks a fine line between being too snooty and being just plain awesome.  Ive had a couple of experiences here, and overall the food is really tasty.  Im a fan of the gnocchi, even though its a little different than traditional gnocchi. The location is great, as long as there isnt a douche bag convention going on, and as long as the bartenders and servers keep their positive attitudes, I think this place will be around for a while. Thanks!"
5,"The food in this place is indescribably awesome! Granted, the place could be nicer, but if youre in the mood for great food without the frills of a great looking place: this is it. The service is fast, friendly, and the prices are great- especially knowing that their portions are typically huge. I cant finish my plate most of the time, so I always end up taking leftovers home.  I love their Jade Red Chicken, as well as their emerald chicken. Their black beans are to die! Order a combo plate, if this is your first time here. Youll get a good mix of everything and youll leave without regrets!"
5,"What can I say... we eat here once a week for lunch cuz we can walk here. We come here for happy hour twice a week cuz we can walk here.  So, yeah its pretty convenient... but we STAY here after hours to play poker because the servers know us by name and the food is priced right and the poker crowd is really cool and its a great place to eat-n-learn. And we LOVE Tony because that guy says hello to EVERY CUSTOMER EVERY TIME.  Trust me on this one... jump off the freeway for happy hour... youll know what I mean when Tony says hello to you, too. PS get the three meat calzone. You look great and can afford the calories..."
4,"Love this place. Actually, today was awesome, because they usually only offer the ""express dozen"" through the drive thru, and the kids didnt want to go in, so the dude behind the speaker actually fulfilled my order as I wanted. The only thing that bugs the hell out of me is that they charge for 2 donuts when you get a long john. :-("
5,"I Felt a sin coming on .......  if i could give 10 stars i would !!!! Let me set the scene for you of this Kazilicious Sunday night ..... We enter through  a solid planked door set in the rear ...(oh yes the truth is inside) candlelit passageway leads you into a sexy,sultry stone interior that is softened by the plush seating , dim lighting ,wine barrels .. i give his hand a squeeze and smile because we have hit the mother load within this sinfully sexy speakeasy .The Tuscan colors coupled with the stone ..deep ,rich ,decadent !!! His hand on the small of my back as we approach our seats as the intimacy and ambiance takes hold . A bowl of olives, 3 cheese fondue with apple ,the Tuscany pizza ....sexy damn noshes ..they know what they are doing here ..soft ...firm....dip....bite ..yesssss SO beyond sexy here..... Oh and the wine ,nectar of the gods, sign of fertility , here in this setting it is like Ambrosia ,and your inner God or Goddess will surely blossom ,and romance will bloom .... It seems like thousands of labels here - we went with the  M. Chapoutier Le Sizeranne 98 ....Heady ,earthy ,smoky ,deep ,sweet and ripe .the smell of currants and berries .lovely texture ,full bodied .....DIVINE ! let the flirting begin ..coy toying of the glass stem ..sweet smiles ..love words escaping on a whisper  between sips. We spent around $200 ,worth every penny in my opinion . Prior to the Kaz , the Rokerij was just about the sexiest spot to me in the valley ...these two must share the crown . So to recap ; SEXY, SULTRY,SEDUCTIVE !!!!! posh,swank ... Good Service , lush wine selection ,yummy tidbits ... Ambiance up the wazoooo . A heady experience ..this is where lovers go ,a prelude to the interlude of love !"
5,"I love Gabriel. He does an amazing job every single time Im there. I generally get two peekaboo highlights put in, and a cut and style, and always leaving looking great. His attitude is always upbeat, it would be impossible to spend any time in his chair and not leave in a good mood. The salon is always clean and comfortable. I never feel like Im being forced into spending more money or buying product, but when I have a question about what I should be using in my hair Gabe always makes excellent suggestions. I have recommended him a good friend and my mother and both love him. My mother even left her stylist of 10 years to start going to him because of the excellent service he provides."
4,Great food at a great price. Not the best Italian food but definitely a step up from all of the national chains. Also great lunch prices
2,"My favorite thing about this place is the decor. It is crazy beautiful. I also like that you can get better than average bar food until late and there are so many places to sit, youll never have an issue with waiting. Their food is okay, but nothing spectacular.  I used to live in Arcadia, and I miss it every day. If I were to move back to Phoenix/Scottsdale- I would never even consider a different neighborhood. Across the board, it is the friendliest and most beautiful neighborhood in Maricopa County. That being said- The Vig represents the lame element of the neighborhood. People with too much money and bad taste. I think someone else called it ""schmoozy"" and thats exactly it! As a neighbor, we usually rode our bikes- so I cant speak to parking. Do they not still have the shuttle? Give me The Great Escape, JTs or Postinos any day."
5,"Every time I go in this place its always a great experience.  My wife and I have been going to Lucilles pretty much every other Sunday for the last couple months.  Her favorite is the pulled pork mine is the Kansas City ribs, but we always have to start our meal off with the fried pickles.  If youre on a tight budget even buying one meal and sharing it is a definite option.  Sometimes I get full on the biscuits and spread the provide in the beginning. The bar area is a great place to have a meal and watch a game.  I would highly recommend this establishment to any of my friends.  But make sure you get the fried pickles... you will not be disappointed. Oh yeah.....please please please order the Mac N Cheese as your side.  You will thank me later. Q"
4,"Lunchtime out with a relative on a weekday, and La Condesa has a seat by the window. There is really nothing like its saloon-artsy walls for us to gaze.   The Dia De los Muertos motif and wooden furniture make it perfect for easy conversation.   Most folks seated around us already know where to go for lunch thats not too pricey and homemade.   The Horchata is nothing short of liquid dessert, filled with pecans, fruit and rice milk.  You can avoid dairy all together with this and a special bullet burro with guac and lettuce. The salsa bar sets the standard for good restaurants.  Its wide variety of salsas leave little doubt what creative people run the place.  My hope is that only a few people read this and try it. Otherwise, to my chagrin, the next time we park on 16th Street, we may have to WAIT in a line outside."
4,"I adore Radio Milano. Tried to hit it up this last Thursday evening and found it to be closed. I was really depressed by this as I have had my eye on the deviled eggs and the beautiful bartender boy the last couple of times Ive dined here. (neither of which Ive been able to try yet...booooo!!)  According to the valet guy across the street at Postino they are scheduled to re-open in early April. Apparently with somewhat more of a ""lounge like"" feel or some such nonsense. Works for me!  I hope they keep the Tuna Crudo around which is just insanely good. Drown yourself in some chocolate pudding for desert, you wont regret it. Ahhhhh, now Im hungry... dont worry about me, he was too pretty to be straight anyway."
2,"Weve been here several times with our kids and grandkids.  Its a good family spot, but the service is just okay.  We love the fresh chips, and the wings are good.  Salads are meh.  Well come again because its a good spot for the kids, but well come expecting not great service."
4,"Most of my excitement and ""love"" of this place has more to do with what it represents -- not what it is right at this second, but I fully expect that to get better. TFM representing a place in Central Tempe to get basic groceries (all the better that theyre local and organic!) without needing access to a car.  When I looked up the location, I felt heartsick at the thought that this is right across the street from where the Co-Op used to be. Whats there now? An empty dirt lot. The Co-Op was driven out by an over zealous real estate company that, in the boom of condo building, bought the location, driving Co-Op to another spot where it eventually failed. Know what else failed? That condo endeavor. Now, a few years later, we have this budding marketplace with a lot to live up to. My first trip in, I didnt have anything particular I needed, I just wanted to check things out (though I was making enchiladas later that day, so had a few items I was on the look-out for).  Its pretty small right now, and in the former building of Jakes Shop, which is also another Tempe staple now gone. But it had the basics such as milk, peanut butter, a small selection of produce -- local, of course -- cheese and even some gift-type items for sale in the back.  I picked up some green onions (99 cents for a bunch) and red peppers ($1.29/ea), and thought those prices were exact with a chain grocery. And bread - this is my favorite part of the store! A big selection of sliced wheats and grains, and rolls and longer Ciabatta styles too. And the favorite of my favorite? Fresh ""Made this morning!"" tortillas! They looked delicious, and were HUGE. The size of a large pizza, they came in flavored varieties for making yummy wraps. When I checked out ($5 minimum for credit card purchases, and a sign said ""EBT coming soon""), I was offered another red pepper from a basket by the register because this small batch was about to go bad. So instead of letting them and then throwing them away, they *give* them away with each purchase - wonderful!  Oh, and I was surprised and pleased to see a small corner of the store set up with a couple small tables and a couch, all within view of a large flat screen playing Alice in Wonderland. Sure enough, a kid sat there, out of the way and quiet, while is parents shopped. Both parents and the childless thank the owners for THAT kid haven, Im sure. I really look forward to coming in again and again and watching this place grow and thrive. p.s. I highly recommend becoming a fan of their FB page, so you can get daily info about what they just got in, specials, new additions, etc."
1,"Overcrowded, sprawling mess of a mall (and I normally like malls). Traffic and parking are almost as bad as at Tempe Marketplace. The confusing layout makes it hard to find specific stores (even with the help of the directories)."
5,"This review pertains to carnitas, and as such should not be taken as a suggestion for ordering any of the following: fish tacos, rice, beans, horchata. Thats about it! Yum!"
2,"We went here for the fabulous UYE. As the restaurant is often empty, Julia though it would be good to give them some business...but in the end it was our group that ended up being given the business. The words highway robbery come to mind, but I guess we werent really on the highway. The prices listed on the menu really didnt seem that out of line, a bit on the pricey side but nothing alarming. Our waitress slyly sold us a kazillion dollars worth of appetizers that were not on the menu. We got 4 plates which consisted of 4 individual sauces with some stuff in them...one had shrimp, one had chicken, one had pork, and one had chihuahua. Oh wait, I think that was the cheese on top. Anyway, the plate with 4 tablespoons of sauce was not worth the $25...oh wait, we got 4 of them. The waitress also managed to slip two orders of guacamole in on us for $11 a piece. As far as the entrees are concerned, the portions were small and the food was kind of meh. The mole was way too sweet for my taste. The biggest bummer of all was NO BOOZE! The $120 worth of appetizers would have gone over much better if they were washed down with some frosty margaritas. A couple of pitchers and they could have slipped us some $100 flan. Regardless of the price and the mediocre food, it was well worth going for the amazing company of the awesome Phoenix Yelpers. I dont think I would go back for the food though."
4,First time impressions are the most important and Culinary Dropout made an ever lasting one. Everything from the service to the food was spot on perfect. The whole experience was so good that its hard to believe it will be the same when I go back.  I hope it is............
1,"Price reflects quality and service.  5/2010 purchased wedding gown, brides maids and mothers (bride and groom mothers and grandmothers) dresses.  Girls were rude and our brides maids dresses seems and straps fell apart just before the wedding."
5,"One of my top choices for downtown Phoenix. Always an upscale, posh vibe, but with very generous prices on entrees. Good looking people throughout this bar.  The Kisras are VERY tasty and a good spin off the typical flatbreads at many restaurants now.  Brunch here on Saturdays or Sundays-- great drink specials too."
2,"I came in here wanting and expecting this place to be amazing.  I wanted this place to be 5 stars. ugh, I feel like a failure for giving it 2.  Ive heard such good things about this place, and was expecting it to be good, but unfortunately, it was not.  :-( I walked in and placed my order.   The menu seems to be decent enough, with a fair amount of selection.  Ample amounts of toppings, and you can have your burger a few different ways. Mind you, Im a burger lover, so Im always up for places like this. I ordered a regular burger with all the fixings and BBQ sauce on top.  I got the fries too.  It came in a brown bag..I guess thats how they serve it regardless if you eat in or not. I was dissappointed with the burger itself.  It seemed like it came with way to much topping. I mean, like an overwhelming amount.  I ate it, and the burger was okay, but not as good as I have experienced at other comparable places.  I wasnt looking to be ""blown away"" by the burger, but I wasnt really impressed over all.  It wasnt that great, to much on the toppings, and it didnt really do much for me.  I will say tho, you get a TON of fries tho. I left feeling underwhelmed, and dont know that I will be back in the future."
4,Great service and delicious breakfasts!
4,"Same great Lolos fried chicken and waffles without the risk of getting stabbed or shot... and it WAS worth the risk to visit their South Phoenix location on occasion. The food is that good, it might even be the ultimate in comfort food! Lucky for us they have a new Scottsdale location where the most dangerous situation you could encounter might be a hungover Scottsdale ""clubber"" (who could scratch you with their Ed Hardy bling). The only suggestion I have for them is to drop the prices about 25%"
4,"My friend who I was visiting and I went here for a fundraiser type of a deal.  I dont know what I was expecting but I really liked the island concept of the place.  My friend recommended a salad and I got a Caribbean chicken salad with some sort of coconut rice, chicken,  oranges, pineapple, tortilla strips, etc.  Well, the salad was huge!!!  The honey lime dressing was very flavorful and complimented the salad well.  We shared the rumbi fries, which were a combination of sweet and regular fries, and as aforementioned in some other reviews, I love the sweet potato fries and wish they all could have been that (do I sound like the Beach Boys?).   The decor was pretty cute and the music was great (Marley, Buffett type stuff).  The rice bowls looked fantastic, as did the sandwiches.  The prices were pretty good, considering the amount of food you received."
5,"Dr. Ellis is compasionate, caring, and really demonstrates his passion for what he does. The entire staff made us feel comfortable from the moment we walked in to the time we left the office. They went the extra step to make sure my 5 year old was having fun at the dentist! I would recommend this office to anyone who has children. Dr. Ellis and his team are the best!"
5,"Id been hearing about Defalcos for a while now. My husband, Jim W, and my youngest, Abby, raved. ""Best steak grinda since Baston,"" they said. So, on an expedition to get more raw chocolate, we went. The first thing I noticed was that the tables were scattered among the racks of Italian foodstuffs. I loved that. The place screamed ""Boston"" from the moment we walked in the door. When we ordered, Jim found one of my favorite types of soda in the case, Doc Browns diet black cherry. I was in heaven. So we got our number and sat down. While we were waiting - a short wait - I got a brilliant idea which solved a long-vexing problem. Guess it was the east coast vibe. The food came and I was in heaven. We split a steak sandwich and red potato salad. Jim likes everything and I just like onions so they gave him the mushrooms and peppers on the side. Lots of mushrooms and peppers. It didnt look like a ton of food but we certainly got enough to eat. Whats not to like at Defalcos? The food is fabulous, the prices are good, the people are really nice, and they have all kinds of imported goodies. So I guess the only thing I didnt like about Defalcos was leaving."
5,"Went wed nite, wife tells me best gnocchi since Europe, were cooked perfectly . I had pollo erbe, terrific.  "" wine tasting director"" very good, with tasty selections. Will be back, OFTEN. Highly recommend. Rich D"
5,"I had a great experience with this company today.  They sent out their tech Steve to fix my Samsung tv.  He arrived on time and was able to quickly diagnose and fix the problem.  He also provided some helpful tips to improve the performance of the tv in other areas unrelated to the issue. The service was professional, prompt, and efficient.  I would definitely use them again in the future."
1,"After reading all the good reviews, we were looking forward to eating here, but we were a bit apprehensive due to the couple of bad reviews because of the smell. Bummer...the smell just killed it for us right from the get go. Immediately, upon walking in the door, the pungent smell of backed up sewer hit us like a ton-of-bricks. We did a 180 and walked right out. No way I could sit through a meal here while breathing that funk.  Get the smell worked out and we will give you another shot, Tasty Thai."
5,"Had to update because weve now tried the pizza! For all the times we have visited weve never tried a pizza (too many other really good options to choose I guess...) We ordered the Italian Classic (veggies & meat). We ordered it a little well done/crispy and were not disappointed! It was hot, fresh and cooked perfectly!  Service was great as usual even though they were completely SLAMMED with customers the day before Thanksgiving filing numerous growlers of their pumpkin beer which sold out in less than record time! We were there again last weekend for the football games and made it in time to order our favorite breakfast items - eggs benedict and the braised pork dish with beans, potatoes, two eggs and fresh warm tortillas.  It was fantastic! This dish, just like many others (possibly ALL others) is plenty for 2 to share.  Service was exceptional and the crowd fun and rowdy rooting for their teams and AZ won - so there were a lot of happy customers that day!"
2,"So, I went because of all the hype. Immediately, realized how overrated it was. The ambiance is like a Chilis but trying to be mexican."
4,I loved it. The salad bar is not so great but everything else is excellent!
5,"They had Kool Aid! i was so happy to see it :) The chicken and waffles were really good... my girlfriend and I went straight there from the airport, before going to our hotel, and it was completely worth it...  yeah, waiting outside in 100 degree heat isnt ideal, but for 10 minutes you can deal with it... especially when they had someone outside giving out water If youre ever in Phoenix like us, or live out there, definitely stop in!!!"
1,"Went last night to Whore Foods to get basics to make pizza with, most clutch to the process was a three pack of yeast. Low and behold, the dirty hippie kids they have working there again didnt put something in the bag. And this time it was the yeast. I love the food there, but the employees are nothing more than entitled hippie kids from Scottsdale who cant be bothered to do their goddamn jobs! I am so sick of this crap with this corporation. Maybe its a Phoenix thing, or maybe its the hiring and firing processes of Whore Foods, but I am done shopping at any Whore Foods. In a place like Phoenix, where you have alternatives such as Sprouts, youd think Whore Foods would smarten up. Or when you try to ask someone who works here where something is, and they just walk by with their nose high in the air. I understand its important to show your fellow dirt merchants that youre a super star, but I dont work with you, I contribute to your salary and over inflated set of benefits for a grocery clerk, so do your goddamn job. Useless little girl in need of a shower and orthodontist.  But alas, Whore Foods and its dirty hippie employees have alienated yet another person with a job and a degree into hating everything that place stands for. Oh yea, one other thing, take the concealed firearm prohibition off of your stores. It didnt stop Jared Loughner from doing something horrid, and all it does is alienate law abiding citizens from their Constitutional rights. I understand you think that only parts of the Constitution should apply, but honestly I think you need to pull your collective heads out of your ass and take a shower. Useless motherf*&#$@s!"
1,"I recently had a shit cleaned at the Intercontinental Hotel in Hong Kong. Not cheap. I only mention that because this place charged MORE to clean that suit - almost $30 for a two-piece suit after they tacked on their $6 ""designer brand"" surcharge (no, I am not kidding). Despite branding as ""green"" the suit still reeked of solvent (the green, silica-based solvents have never left an odor in my experience). No differentiation to justify these absurd prices - a lot of good alternatives in the area. Be warned!"
4,"This would typically be a 3 star review, but it gets another star for the following: * Great air conditioning * Arizonas only Neiman Marcus * Hilarious people watching * Great happy hour haunts in the basement * Everyone here has a better tan than I do   Scottsdale Fashion Square is large and in charge and is definitely a sprawling spectacle to see at least once.   Theres no denying that its a local institution -- even if the store mix is a bit too pricey and exclusive for some."
3,"I usually get the Arizona Smashchicken or the Arizona Cobb Salad.  Both are always delicious!  Sometimes they are really spicy and other times not so much.  I guess it depends on who is making it and how many jalapenos get in there.   The chicken is really flavorful, unlike a lot of other chicken sandwiches/salads where the chicken is bland and adds nothing to the meal.  I think I am the only person I know that isnt a fan of the Smashfries.  They are generally tasty, but I would far prefer regular fries.  I really like this place, but its a little pricey for what you get.  Lunch for two will probably set you back a least $20... its not too bad, but your $20 will go a lot further other places."
5,"Always consistent. Great service, great carne asada and a pleasant patio on a beautiful day."
5,"Bad ass, just like the name.  Ive heard that this facility doesnt have any water restrictions so their course is lush & in tip top shape.  Its definitely a challenging course.  The staff is nice and the current off season rate is  $35 for residents!  You have to check it out, its a great deal."
3,"On a recent visit to Arizona, my mother and I ventured into this store. Neither of us had stepped foot in it before, even though she lives a mile away.  The aisles are broken out by cuisine, and the selection was awesome.  I was particularly surprised by the Holland, Dutch, Brazilian, and British aisle, in market classified as Asian. Very unexpected. I bet they would be more business if they boasted to be more international.  I really liked this place, but the word needs to get out about Lee Lees.  If more people shop, they will restock their shelves more often, and most items wont be so close to their expiration date.  Final points: - check expiration dates before purchasing - Generally clean but the shelved items needed to be dusted and straightened, especially the aisle with dishes. They were all over the place and had to hunt for matching bowls.  Its a market, not a dollar store - If you can get past the initial fish smell, you wont be disappointed."
4,"In my book Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks are on the top tier of the coffee shop pyramid. Because this Dunkin Donuts is a couple hundred feet north of Starbucks in this Wal-Mart power center, this location is the opportune review to compare the strengths and weaknesses of each chain using characteristics of these locations. FOOD    Dunkin Donuts blows Starbucks out of the Phoenix Valley when it comes to food. Whereas I am a fan that goes back to my teen years of Dunkin Donuts toasted bagels with cream cheese, I regard Starbucks bagels as filler food that tastes equivalent to a supermarket bagel. Dunkin Donuts signature donuts are the bomb. Starbucks pastries are filling yet forgettable. COFFEE     Long before Starbucks landed on New York soil in the 90s, Dunkin Donuts coffee was the ultimate cup of Joe. In a way Dunkin Donuts is still the ultimate cup of Joe. In my mind their coffee is slightly better than Starbucks. Especially with their added light blueberry syrup. PRICE    Dunkin Donuts coffee is relatively the same price as Starbucks. Whether I buy a coffee with syrup or ice blended coffee beverage at Dunkin Donuts or Starbucks, the difference in price is relatively zilch. SERVICE    Dunkin Donuts trails behind Starbucks in service. Especially at these locations. At Dunkin Donuts, one man was manning the shop. If there was a rush in business, this would cause customer service issues. On the other hand Starbucks had a crew of employees. The woman who took my order was very charming and friendly. Dunkin Donuts service does have one advantage over Starbucks, which is the employees put in the cream and sugar for you. COFFEE SHOP EXPERIENCE   As far as a place to hang out, Dunkin Donuts trails far behind Starbucks. This is another Dunkin Donuts where the subliminal message is to sip your coffee eat your food and move on. Starbucks on the other hand promotes hanging out with complimentary WiFi and comfortable seating."
5,"Fuego Bistro is one of my new favorites! A couple people have recommended it to me, so my boyfriend and I decided to try it for restaurant week.  We arrived about 15 minutes before our reservation to have a drink on the patio. The staff was super welcoming and friendly. Matt enjoyed a mai tai and I had a red sangria - both very refreshing. Our table was ready right on time and we had an awesome waitress who gave great suggestions on ordering... there were so many good looking options on their restaurant week menu. Were sharers, so we ordered with that in mind.  Drinks:  We got the pomegranate mojito (very refreshing) and a peach-blood orange mojito (sweet, but very good) Starters:  Signature empanadas: Tasty. The focus was the meat, I would have preferred more vegetables inside. Sauteed prawns: The star here were the sauces - delicious! Entrees:  Cola Braised Short Ribs: AMAZING! Some of the best weve ever had. The short ribs were very tender and not fatty at all. The flavor was so good! Pernil Asado (shredded pork): So delicious!! I made little tacos with their fresh corn tortillas.  Sides:  Green chili cornbread casserole: A little drier than I had imagined, but great flavor.  Maple chiliglazed carrots: The glaze didnt really stand out to me, but good as far as baby carrots go. Jalapeno creamed corn: I was pleasantly surprised - really enjoyed this one!  Chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes: A great side with the short rib.  Dessert: (By this point, we knew wed need to be rolled out of the restaurant, but we HAD to have dessert since it was part of restaurant week).  Chocolate chip bread pudding: Really good chocolate chip bread with scoops of malted chocolate crisp ice cream. This was a lot of food after that meal, but I savored the bites I had. The ice cream was excellent! Banana burrito: exactly what youd picture with scoops of the same icecream - delicious!  I cant wait to go back to Fuego and tell my friends about it. Great service, charming atmosphere, and excellent dishes.... Fuego is a winner!"
4,"Food is great.  Best Thai in West Valley.  Always get takeout so not sure about the service, but takeout is always ready when they say it will be ready.  The atmosphere is quiet and cozy - about a dozen to fifteen tables or so.  Place always seems clean when I pick my food up and has the type of decor youd expect to see in a Thai restaurant.   I usually get red chicken or beef curry hot, and my wife gets green curry mild.  The food is excellent.  Their egg rolls arent very greasy like most places.  Spring rolls are also made fresh to order with fresh veggies.  The only thing is, sometimes the spiciness of the curry will be spicier some days and not as spicy others.  Other than that, this place is great."
4,"I am so sorry I didnt come here sooner! This is a great sports bar not far from our house. The service was very friendly, and the killer wings (they also have honey BBQ) were awesome. They had tons of meat on them, which isnt always the case with wings, as I am sure most of you can attest. We also had the margherita pizza, which was pretty tasty. There were numerous TVs scattered throughout the restaurant, and they had $1 beers (yes $1) when we were there - fantastic deal! This place is definitely more chill than Fox Sports Grill (not quite as fancy or upscale), but its a perfect sports watching or beer drinking venue nonetheless.  Oh, and they deliver!!!!!! Good choice if you live in North Scottsdale."
1,"Heres the 1. 2. 3... 1. Great Food. I love hot New Mexico style food. Good job. 2. They have a little brewery and make 3 house beers. Unfortunately, theyre all shitty. 3. They could REALLY improve the service. No Bueno!  Well be back for the food. It might be take out next time though! 4-17-11 Update: Some asshole who was clearly affiliated with Arribas contacted me via private message to slam me for my review. I hope the yelp police find you and pull you off the site. More importantly, I hope more people read my review and stay away from this restaurant. Good Food folks, just get it to go! To Bryan L. and the rest of the gang over at Arribas....Go EFF yourselves! You get one star and NO more of my money!!!!!!! Learn how to work, Kid!"
1,"The office space, layout, presentation gets 5 stars, the customer service you receive from the employees at Corporate Office Center is a negative 10. They will scare your clients off, scare your own staff and make your life a living hell. Their office locations and space is beautiful but if a say, a client shows up at a time other than their scheduled time, they will be told to leave. They will be told you dont provide any services at the locations and if anyone could single handedly ruining your professional image, Corporate Office Centers can do this for you! BE AFRAID!!!! They are dedicated to working against, not with you."
4,"Its usually a ghost town at the downtown Phoenix bars, but when a game and/or concert is happening, suddenly the bars are bustling. Such was the case last night at Majerles, former Phoenix Suns player Dan Marjerles sports bar. With the Beyonce concert across the street at the arena AND a D-backs game at the ball park, Phoenix was a hoppin. My friend and I stopped into Majerles, which Ive been to a few times before, for dinner and drinks before going to see Beyonce. I had a cheeseburger and Cesar Salad. While I realize its hard to mess up a Cesar Salad, my salad was seriously the best Cesar Ive ever had. And my burger was packed with flavor. No wonder AOL  named them Best Burgers two years in a row. We also had a wonderful chocolate martini (with Vanilla Vodka, not creme based) here. And on Fridays if youre in the mood to really start the night, the bar offers a Corona or Pacifico with a shot of tequila for $7 as part of their Sizzlin Friday special. My only complaint was that our waitress suddenly went M.I.A for about 15 minutes when we were trying to close our tab so we could go to the show.  But Im still going to cut them some slack because this is one of a few fun places to drink in the downtown area. HOT TIP: A second Majerles will be opening in Chandler in the fall."
4,Decent BBQ food but nothing to scream about... but be prepared to have a TON of food to eat.
5,"Wine, booze and cigars. And friendly staff. Theres not much else that needs to be said. Oh and great prices. The selection and prices they offer are great. The aisles are wide and clearly marked. The cigar room has a great selection as well and the prices are low."
4,"After my sixth or so visit here at Big Earls I have to give them a four plus rating. My first time here was opening night and it was ok...the second time was improved...third time good...etc. Now when I come in the smoke is starting to impermiate in the walls leaving a wonderful smokey resonance in the dining room, and the food has become exponentially better!!! I am like most people in the serious dining population, a lover of all things pork. And while they do some real good pig here, I am thrice impressed with the beef offerings! I like to judge a restaurant on the dishes I would absolutely return for, and the brisket is for sure that item here. Actually, the beef ribs are also one of those ""return for"" items as well. They, much like the brisket, are perfectly smokey, wonderfully seasoned, and impossibly tender. I highly suggest either one. As for the sides, I can honestly recommend the collards, potato salad, and the Mac and cheese...although its not a creamy Mac, but it is gooey enough to pass my palates stamp of approval.  A huge selling point for me when I dine out are the drink specials, or selection. They are GREAT here!!! Being a total whisky slut, I am in heaven here, with dozens of delicious options, and the handful of beers on tap here make me happy for the change in libation after a few too many. Try the front porch cocktail, one of my top five here in town. Big Earls has proven that with time, all things become better. Like I said before, each separate visit has been more fulfilling than the last. I can only imagine how the experience will be, come summer and autumn, my guess is pretty damn amazing!"
4,The food was good and all prepared as I waited.  Looks like a long list of wide ranging bad foods that make you feel so good!
3,"Good salad options. It is definitely tough to mess up lettuce and veggies.  As for the rest of the selection, we must have just come on a bad night. The pasta was overcooked and mushy, not even close to al dente.  Fresh fruit selection consisted of only 3 fruits, not exactly a vast selection.  If you want a good salad, definitely the place to go."
5,"As good as all the others, and closer to home than most."
5,"I am a huge ""foodie"", from a long line of ""foodies"". I grew up living in hotels and on room service and fine dining. This is the best, very best, breakfast restaurant EVER! I have been living in Tempe for about six years now, the first two sad sad years I did not know that this wonderful place existed...after my first visit, this is my go-to, best place to recommend, favorite breakfast place to eat at! If you go on a Sunday, it will be very very busy. Everyone is super friendly. The place is very clean. Prices are amazing! Cheaper or as cheap as the nasty breakfast places or fast food. Huge portions and great quality food. I have never had a bad experience here, and to be honest...even if I did, I wouldnt care. I feel like home here. Everything on the menu is delicious! Ive tried almost everything. Here are a few of my favorites (dont forget though, I love it all) : OPear Grenache Omelette, Greek Fetash Omelette, English Harvest Omelette, Huevos Con Chorizo (with scrambled eggs), and the Blueberry Hill Girdle Cakes (pancakes! you can order half an order or little ones...we always get an order to share at the table). Their potatoes are delicious and crispy, the english muffins are great and their homemade jam is absolutely amazing! I have bought many jars of their jam to give as gifts! Just delicious! I wish everyone knew about this well kept secret. DONT LISTEN TO ANY REVIEW UNDER A 5 STAR! This place is the best, bottom line. Try it. You will be hooked."
5,"We went on a Friday night and even though it is off season here, the place was packed. Never the less, the service was impeccable as always. This is our third trip here and we have never been disappointed. I had the 14 Oz. NY strip and my wife had the prime rib. Both were cooked to perfection and seasoned ever so  wonderfully! My wife tells me the horseradish is the real deal and not the runny stuff you get elsewhere...cant vouch as I hate the stuff.  From the bread to the desert, every bite was worth taking. The old time ambiance with the dark wood and red ""leather""? booths are welcoming. Its pricey and if you can ignore the geek with khakis, no socks and deck shoes ever so gently cradling his wine...(you KNOW the guy and he is everywhere) in the middle of a Phoenix summer, it is worth every single cent."
4,"Looking for something refreshing to escape this crazy AZ heat? Ritas may be your answer!  I stopped by yesterday with Lindsey F, and was pleasantly surprised by all of the unique flavors of ice and custard to choose from: Swedish Fish? Check! (and it tastes exactly like the candy).  Lemonade, Cherry, Mango? Check, Check, Check!  I ended up taking home a quart of half lemonade and half cherry.  My husband and I dug into it last night. Next time Ill have to try the custard... or perhaps the Sour Patch Kid flavor that is coming out this week!  Mmmm!"
2,I have gone here quite a few times. I like having a diner close by for breakfast and newspaper reading. But this one is always short staffed. And there doesnt seem to be much management around to smooth things out. Food is usually good but staff always seems stressed out. May be due to serving hoards of poor tipping elderly.
4,"This place has apparently been open for about 2-3 weeks.  I headed here with some co-workers for a late Friday ""meeting"".  Otherwise known as happy hour!  They have a good selection of beer on draft and bottle.  I had a New Belgium Super IPA that they had on draft and one of their sausages(Chicken and Apple) topped with some sauerkraut and mustard.  It was quite a good combination and was recommended by our server. If youre looking for food, then you may be disappointed in the small amount of options, however, when you realize that their kitchen is the size of a small closet, it kind of makes sense.  With the cooler weather right on the horizon here in the valley, their very large patio area should come in quite handy. I will definitely try them out again."
4,"WOWSA- we just moved here from NYC and this pizza is like home :)  We tried the Brooklyn and Da Works  pies and the Brooklyn was WAY BETTER. I didnt like the Da Works (dont care for fresh tomatoes on top of my pizza).   This will be our regular pizza joint for the area- we were both impressed and will order many more Brooklyn pizzas from NYPD! Having just moved from NYC we can speak with authority when we say ""Its authentic NY pizza!"""
3,"Gracies is a small thrift store with decent items.  The prices are a little less than you would pay at Goodwill.  You can get a pair of jeans for about $5.  If you need a belt, this would be a good place to go, only $2.  I didnt find anything to buy for myself, but we found a new pair of shorts for my son.  Only $2.50.   Just an FYI, it costs $0.75 to use your debit card."
5,"New owners are awesome!!!!!  Good people, earnest in providing a great product with great service.  The restaurant is beautiful too.  My mouth starts watering right when I walk in the door.  Go check them out!!!!"
5,"Lives up to the local fuss. Quick, cheap, tasty and one of the few fast Mexican food restaurants that utilize yellow cheese, which is my cardinal rule of good Mexican food."
5,Apparently fellow yelper Andrew and I are meeting in our dreams over maple bacon creme brulee! Im seriously glad to see that I am not the only one having subconcious yearnings for this lil dab of heaven in a cup! All of the products are top notch though and who doesntlike creme brulee? Communists maybe? Chef Eric is awesome and so friendly too.
4,Just got back from Carlsbad Tavern.  It was good.  Great service.  Fun atmosphere. Kid friendly.  Loved their black beans.  My husband loved his fish taco salad.  I liked my meal.  I wasnt excited about my food like my husband was.  My only suggestion to them would be to add more vegetarian options without relying on cheese.
4,"This could possibly be 5 stars. Driving by you would never know this restaurant serves excellent Italian food. It is rather small and has a very different decor from other Scottsdale restaurants. I went on a Friday night and there were not many people there and I have walked by on other weekend nights and it was the same result.  Regardless of that the food was outstanding. I ordered a special, lobster risotto and it was superb. There are many other things on the menu which I would like to try as well. It is rather expensive, but well worth it. The service was also very quick, and it should be when there are not many people dining."
4,This place is similar to Rays on 3rd St. It was lunch time I had an eggplant parm sub very good the eggplant was nicely breaded not gooey and gross. The kid had a slice of cheese the slices are HUGE. The pizza and service here are always good. I suggest this place for dinner more so the meals are way better they come with a house salad and they have more options pasta and such. They deliver too.
2,"Ive had dinner there a couple of times.   The bar is great and the drinks are OK.  The outdoor patio looks comfy and inviting.  It has a large outdoor fireplace.  The inside atmosphere is busy but fun.  The food is always good.  Fish and steak tacos are fantastic.  The macaroni and cheese is one of the best i have ever had and my brother who was visiting from Kansas almost O.D.d on  the stuff.  My only issue would the lack of an obvious manager on the floor or presence of any hierarchy.  Also the lack of hats in the kitchen bothered me a little so dont look if that bothers you also.   Stopped going back, very erratic dining experience.  Over- priced and extremely uneven service.  The wait staff seems completely untrained and unaware."
2,"We arrived at 7:00, had a party of six, and were able to be seated within 15 minutes. Fabulous, considering the number of hungry people coming into the restaurant that evening, but we have always had good luck getting right into Grimaldis, regardless of the location. The new Scottsdale Quarter location has great ambience and service going for it, but I was sorely disappointed by the quality of the pizza. One of the reasons my partner and I keep going back to the Old Town location is for the consistently tasty crust: crisp and thin, yet chewy and moist as well. Our pizza last night had a thicker crust and too well done, by comparison. Maybe the QC will improve as time goes on--Im sure well be back to see."
5,"PHENOMENAL place for Chinese cuisine. The portions are HUGE! My fiance and I always only order one thing and share it, and still always have leftovers. The menu prices are very reasonable. Including tip, we usually dont spend more than $15 for the both of us for dinner. They are very personable and attentive to your needs. I love that it is a very dainty, and has a very laid back atmosphere. The lemon chicken is our favorite!! :) They are also very kid friendly. We have an 18 month old son who always leaves a nice pile of rice on the floor every time we leave lol, but they love him! Highly recommend!"
5,"Japanese chefs, top notch sashimi, affordable neighborhood sushi place! 5/5 Id lived in Japan before and this place can beat those in Tokyo! If you go to Hiro, you have to order their sashimi. We always order scallops sashimi, yellow tail, salmon, toro sashimi and uni (sea urchin)! Their rolls are amazing too. All sashimi comes in a big-fat-lap portion! Very fresh! The service is great too."
5,"No matter where you go in the World if you are wearing an in and out shirt or hat some big guy usually yells out ""In and Out Man I love that place"" I think that says it all."
4,"great beer, great food, great prices and its haunted!!!"
1,"Very unpleasant experience. Creepy male doctor. Uncaring. And no help. I went to this Urgent Care with a swollen ankle so painful that I was nauseous, dizzy and having vision problems. The doctor interrogated me and advised me to get my head examined. Im not kidding.  Mom was right: good doctors dont advertise. This place actually solicits Yelp reviews."
4,"The boyfriend and I went here on a Sunday morning hung over from Four Lokos.  The food was fucking great and I dont even like breakfast food.  I got this egg and jalapeno burrito thing with this sort of runny but generally pretty tasty salsa and I wanted to shower in the burrito filling.  I would have bathed in eggs and salsa if only to prolong my experience with this semi-breakfast burrito thing.  I would have married it and had kids with it and bought a house in Michigan nearby a really good school district.  I fell in love with the egg jalapeno burrito thing, I would cuddle with it on weekday mornings and plan trips to national parks with it.   It was also nice sitting on the patio considering the weather is so pretty and the staff was attentive and friendly and slightly charming with their loafers and novelty socks (is that part of the required uniform I wonder?) Im deducting one star for the sheer fact that this place was filled with rich, middle aged white yuppies talking about golfing and/or glued to their cell phone.  The boyfriend and I, being young dirty Mesa kids still slightly intoxicated off Four Lokos, felt mildly out of place in this setting and were a little over whelmed by the amount of yuppie whiteness. Nonetheless, the food was worth the trip and the cozy patio on a Sunday morning was a nice change from, you know, Cheerios on the futon while watching exercise equipment infomercials."
1,"Not worth comin here. Im all for food like this but this restaurant sucks. They gave me and my dad the wrong meal, and the food was not that good. The meat was dry and the rice was cold. Not worth it."
3,"Ive only eaten the buffet here and it was good but nothing special.  To be fair, most Indian buffets are pretty similar, its only when you order from the menu that you see if the restaurant is really a stand-out.  So, I will update this review when Ive gone there for dinner"
4,"Tough to rank this place...   it is a retirement community first off.   The club house is awesome.   Pool is salt water and heated.   Courses are nice, little bit of a challenge but basically flat.   The putt putt course is very challenging and really cool.    Im not impressed at all with the club food and suggest staying away from the roast beef.   It seemed fake."
3,"First time there the other night.  Friday night, not very crowded for 7:30pm.  We were shown to a table in what looked like a back room - the table was not set, there was just a tablecloth and that was it.  The room is to the right as you walk in.  There were only 2 other tables in there and the windows were covered (no view) - it was weird so I immediately asked to be seated in the main part of the restaurant.  Decor seemed cheap - just my initial impression.  Food was pretty good.  Pancetta wrapped shrimp app was good; Service was good.  Entrees were pretty good - Chicken Parm, Fettucine Bolognese all tasty, but not sure I would go back.  Caesar salad was a bit disappointing...asked for anchovies on the side - never delivered."
5,"I have only gotten the cafe sua da (iced coffee) here but its the best I have had yet. When you walk in there is always fresh coffee lined up in cups on the counter ready to be mixed with sweetened condensed milk. I dont get to Mesa often but when I do I go here for the wonderful, rich, dark and creamy coffee. This is strong stuff; that first sip is so good. The richness, full flavor, creamy caramel flavors are heavenly.  And as the ice melts, it mellows out the flavor a little and its still great. I cant say I have had all the cafe sua da in the valley, but what I have had; this is my favorite.  Next time I come to Mesa for work I will need to come at lunch time so I can try the pho."
4,I tried Narai when my family was in town; everyone enjoyed their meal. They have a wide variety of Thai food and sushi and a full bar. Our servers were very attentive.  I had the tofu pad thai with medium spice (which is still pretty spicy). It had a nice flavor to it. and enough of a portion to take leftovers home for lunch. My sister really enjoyed her papaya salad and thai soup and my parents liked the cashew chicken - the sauce had a great flavor.  There arent a ton of Thai restaurants in North Scottsdale... Id say this one is a very solid pick.
5,"Exactly what a hole in the wall Pho place should be like! Totally reminds me of LA, SF or any authentic Pho place in any multi-cultural city. Congrats Phoenix for not being completely white bred and redneck- must give thanks to center city. Anyhow, portions are large, ingredients taste fresh and prices are inexpensive. If youre one of the sheltered folk out here that gets freaked out by rude bums or the lack of decor- stay in the shelter of your HOA tract home or go to the mall."
3,"I took my family here using a groupon and it was just ok.  We tried to go on Monday however we arrived at 4:30 and the employee working the counter informed us that league play was going to begin at 5:30 so our hour would be cut short.  I was a little irritated with her ""um, yeah sorrry"" but whatever.  We opted to come back the next day to get our full hour.  When we arrived we were greeted by a very friendly gentlemen who provided us our shows and assigned our lane.  We were one of 3 groups in the alley and they placed us side by side instead of giving us a little space.  My wife asked for a glass of water that never came.  So the bowling was fun.  The service was marginal at best.  The lane assignment was awful.  Since we only paid $15 for 4 people for the hour including shoe rental I will go back again for the same deal.  I would never go there paying full price which is outrageous."
5,"My work got some Christmas allowance and instead of doing a dinner we decided to get a really nice lunch for our branch. We decided on Oreganos cause it was on the way.  I had the stuffed Italian sandwich and it blew my mind. I couldnt believe how bug this sandwich was, it provided me with two wonderful lunches.  It looks like some of my coworkers got the sausage sandwich and the steak sandwich and one person got a pasta dish and couldnt even eat a quarter of it because they gave so much.  After that experience I am going to make more of an effort to get to the restaurant instead of getting it to go."
5,"This is our DEFAULT happy hour. I wont be reviewing their dinner as I have never had an actual meal there. Im not really a beer drinker, but they have such a big selection, I always find something i like. And Ive been told they have a martini specials, but you dont go to a beer place and get martinis... come on. Pretty much their entire appetizer selection (which is what, 20 items?) is on the half price happy hour menu. You know what that means? Four sliders and fries for FOUR dollars. (Also recommended... Hawaiian Poke Stack). In summary, I can wrap up Yard House in two words. Heck. Yes."
5,"Ive been Dr. Castillas office for 7 years.  Her office has relocated and her practice has grown over the years and for good reason.  She is a Dr. that treats you as a person and takes her time to honestly answer your questions.  She makes eye contact with you and I couldnt ask for anything more.  Just remember, it is a large practice and the staff is sometimes questionable.  But, shes worth the wait!   Now that weve relocated, I hate to give up Dr. Castilla.  Shes irreplaceable!"
3,"Chicago style hot dog?!  Sign me up!  I just moved here from Chicago, and Ive been dreaming of Portillos since I left.  Where am I going to find something even close to that in AZ?!  I was hoping this would be it.  The hot dog wasnt that bad.  The fries on the other hand, werent so good.  My husband ordered a beef with hot peppers (giardiniera), and they were far from hot...almost tasted pickled.  And the sandwich?  TINY!!!  It was like a 4"" beef sandwich!  I didnt taste it, but he said that it just tasted like a roast beef sammy...not the Chicago beef that we are used to.  One of these days well find a decent ""Chicago-style"" restaurant out here in AZ."
4,"They had me at Baked.Goat.Cheese.   The appetizers were phenomenal, we got the Bake Goat Cheese that came with their freshly baked brick oven bread and my bf got the Romaine salad with fuji apple & bacon.  But the baked cheese was by far the better of the two. Main courses also didnt disappoint we ordered the white fish and hanger steak.  I only had a bite of the fish so I cant speak that much to it, the bf enjoyed it.. it had too much lemon in the sauce for me, but I hate lemon flavoring so its probably better to take his word for it!   The steak had this amazing sauce that accompanied it that added such a nice flavor to compliment the steak.  Both entrees were pretty good size portions, especially after appetizers. And we also split a side of sweet corn polenta that we couldnt finish The actual restaurant its self is very open, there is an outside covered patio and a smaller patio for the bar thats out in the open.   Valet only, complementary Sat Night wait time: approx 20 mins Clientele: On Sat night we had a big table of your typical Scottsdale Cougars, average couples and groups ranging from mid 20s to 60s and a bachelorette party of 4 girls who were barely 21 (not the typical place for a bachelorette party)"
5,"My house has never been this clean EVER!!! I am thrilled with the level of service and professionalism expressed by the women who cleaned my house today! I bought a Living Social coupon, and I am so glad I found this company. 5 women arrived and fully cleaned my house in 45 minutes. The women were friendly to me and especially my dog, which is the sign of a wonderful company, if you ask me. I am hoping I am able to use this service on a monthly basis. Angela scheduled my appointment immediately when I let her know I had company coming in town, and the cleaners arrived during the scheduled time. I am thrilled with the results!"
4,"Ihappened by during their soft open, and I was very impressed with the food. They have a great selection of meats and they are cooked perfectly. They even give you choices of regular or moist briskit (a little fattier to give it more flavor). They have a good house barbeque sauce.   The facility is pretty simple - very ""bar"" atmsphere and TVs along the walls. The staff is great, and eager to make sure you enjoy the food. Ill be coming back."
1,"Our bartender was rude and impersonal, to start. When my wife ordered a diet coke, you could see her disdain. We saw her once more, when she took our food order, after which she sat in the corner and ate. The remaining staff dropped off our food without a word, and never came back; in fact, I had to flag down the manager to get cashed out. The food was sub par. My wifes Shepard pie was all mashed potatoes, and my chicken strips were incorrect and with the wrong side. Also, my fries were soggy because they had been placed over excess sauce.  Poor food, awful service, overpriced beer. Visit the Kyrene location or dont go at all."
2,"Came here one morning a couple of weeks ago.  Had about 50 minutes alloted before my Mayo clinic appointment, so I thought a short stack of banana-nut pancakes would get me in and out fast.  I thought wrong.  Staff was friendly enough, but it took at least 10 minutes for the server to finally take my order.  I asked for banana-nut pancakes, but instead of the pancake syrup (not pure maple), I wanted a side of the blueberry compote that usually comes w/ the blueberry pancakes.  Would this be OK?  Server said yes.  The short stack (2 cakes) arrived 15 minutes later, but instead of banana-nut pancakes, these were blueberries, delivered by another server.  My server came by to ask if I needed anything else, heard my complaint, and rushed back to the kitchen to correct it.  I was assured that it would only take 10 minutes to get a fresh batch out, but another 15 minutes went by before the correct order arrived.  Keep in mind, its already been at least 40 minutes since I sat down.  I only had 10 minutes to spare- not enough to savor these delicious cakes.  The blueberry compote ended up containing corn syrup, the ingredient I was trying to avoid by not using the pancake syrup, but its hard for me to resist blueberry compote, so if I must suffer... I most likely will visit Chompies again the next time Im out and about and craving for pancakes, but only if I have 90 minutes or more to spare..."
5,Great home made taste on the meatballs.  Also they have diet coke.  Shop was nice and clean.  Friendly and fast service
5,If I were to ever get hooked on crack... I would want my crack to be these amazing donuts! They are delicious and addicting.
4,"Nice resort located next to the Desert Ridge shopping complex.  If youre from out of town, this would be a great place to stay since youll be across the street from a ton of restaurants and bars. I went to an event here, and haved stayed here a few times.  JW Marriott has hosted a few wine tastings that Ive gone to, and the resort is super nice, with a staff that is ready and waiting to help you no matter what it is you need. The rooms were decently sized and the bed was big and comfy.  The bathroom was nice as well.   The resort has a lot of fountains around and huge windows so you can check out the great views. The pool area is where its at though.  They have a great lazy river to nurse your hangover on, and a water slide for when youre feeling better.  Of course you can get drink and food service out there and you can even rent a cabana- which I recommend.   Its not that pricey- around $100, so if you get a few people to go in with you, its no biggie smalls. The servers are way more attentive to you when you have a cabana and you can choose different packages that come with water and fruit or lunch and so on."
4,"Is this great sushi?  No.  Does this food reinvent the sushi wheel?  Not even close.  Will I have a foodgasm?  Not a chance. When I am craving an amazing sushi meal, Ill go to Yasu. Why I really, REALLY like Teharu: The food is fresh.  While its not amazing fish, theres nothing wrong with it - nothing here to get sick from. All the standards are readily available and if you want something not already on the belt, theyll gladly make it for you. The conveyor really feeds into my lack of patience.  I sat down, ordered an iced green tea, and started pulling plates off the belt.  Yes, I was eating sushi within 90 seconds of sitting down! The price is a HUGE plus!  I met a friend for lunch - we each had iced tea, several plates with 3 or 4 roll slices, seaweed salad, sunumono salad and a couple nigiri and I was out of there for less than $20, including tip. The place is kept incredibly clean, staff is friendly and Teharu fills a nice niche for a super casual, quick sushi place.  When it comes down to it, I cant always afford to spend what that quantity of food would cost me at Yasu or any of the other great places in town - I like that I am not committing to a whole roll - I can sample from 5 or 6 different ones. Fills the need for the sushi craving on a buget and/or when strapped for time."
5,"LOVE THIS PLACE!  We eat here every Saturday as long as we are in town.  My husband eats here during the week too!  Weekday lunches are a great deal and quick!  The veggie soup is delicious.  The golden wings - Delicious... chicken satay is good too.  For an entree... we always get Pad Prik King chicken or sometimes shrimp but its always always delicious!  Have been trying to find a thai place with this dish closer to home (east valley) but havent found one yet!  Service is terrific!  FYI for those of you who just order Pad Thai... it is very sweet here so if you dont like it sweet... order something else.  Other things weve tried that were good... pepper steak - very good - just dont eat a lot of red meat, massamum curry with chicken good... also we order everything medium to thai hot... like very spicy!"
5,LOVE Five Guys!
1,Not worth the money. Food was average and the portion was small for the price I paid.
5,"This feels like a neighborhood bistro (much like the ones I have visited in New York).  The food is wonderful and the wine selection varies which I like.  My favorite dishes include:  Salmon, crab crepe, burger and ahi tartar -- but their menu changes often, so dont be surprised if you eat something you like and its not there next time."
4,Great fast service! Friendly girls that carried on fun conversations. Beautiful salon with nice pedicure chairs. Great prices too!
5,"Barrio Cafe is an amazing Mexican restaurant.  Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza travels to Mexico for many of her ingredients and you can tell - things are always fresh (they only have an ice cream freezer!), creative and authentic.  I am more than content w/ a mango margarita, the incredible guacamole and the gooey caramel filled churros!!  Even when the restaurant is packed, the staff is friendly and informative."
4,"What a great find! We purchased a deal chicken for this restaurant as we had never tried before. We had an absolutely fabulous dinner start to finish. We started with Caprese salad and stuffed mushrooms both were very good, then for entrees, we had Chicken florentina and Pasta romantico. Both sauces were the best we have had! The atmosphere is like you are in Italy. I would have never figured from the location but we will be regulars."
2,"The valet guys were absolutely awesome.  They were the best part of my stay at this hotel.   The grounds were okay - NOT 5 star quality.  The decor in the rooms seemed old, and the color scheme was dated.  Although most of the staff was friendly, we did have a pretty bad encounter with the pool manager.  My husband and I had bought a bag of popcorn at the grocery store and were snacking on it poolside.  The pool manager came up to us and informed us that outside food is not allowed in the pool area.  She told us that we needed to put our food away.  She then left without even offering the opportunity to order some Fairmont approved food.  It was really strange and off-putting.  We had been sitting by the pool for over an hour and not a single person from the wait staff had come up to us to take our drink/food orders.  Also, it seems a bit ridiculous that we cant eat our own bagged popcorn.  Its not like we were chowing down on a big meal and making a mess.  It made the resort seem elitist.  I definitely wont be staying here again. Ive stayed at the Hyatt Regency Scottsdale before and would definitely recommend that hotel over the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess."
4,"I went here for dinner last night with a group and we had excellent service. The specialty drinks were yummy and were a deal! My favorite (out of two I had tried) was the ketel-one pineapple martini! My sister had a house salad, the dressing tasted homemade, and the croutons were nice and crunchy! I had the Positano Steak Sandwich which was great, my only complaint it was a little too salty, and the fries (and I love fries) were tasty! Other people had the lasagna and they loved it. My sister had the baby back ribs and loved them. If youre looking for a pub-like restaurant that has good prices, pretty tasty food (with a good variety of items on the menu), and excellent cocktails, Keegans is your place!"
4,Great setting to enjoy good food!
4,"Had the thick crust Sicilian pepperoni 3/14/2009, took it to the drive in movies, and while it was expensive (23 bucks), it was worth it! This baby could feed 6 people, and it was pretty good as well. I wouldnt get this on a regular basis because of the price and the calories, but I think its the best pizza they have."
2,"So when you walk in, walk to the right and have the machine scan your card. Im telling you this because I looked like a douchebag because I assumed that the Bally worker would scan my card.  Oh yeah, youll smell urine.  Like, did someone just go crazy and piss all over the place? Seriously, how does a smell get so horrendous like that? What is that?  There are a lot of treadmills and theyre recent...not new...they look overused...but yeah. Im sensitive to smell... I couldnt even exercise."
1,"The 3 employees were so busy talking to each other they couldnt remember what we ordered, kept having to ask, and still didnt get it right.  In the midst of the three employees continuing in their personal chaos, my husband finally said, ""ok, time out! Im the customer.  Make our sandwiches and then take care of your issues."". They stopped for a split second, all three looked at us, then they actually IGNORED us, finished their conversation, then finished our sandwiches.  We were the only ones in there and we really were shocked!  Good thing I like avacado, because it ended up on my sandwich & I didnt order it, and after telling the girl, she said, ""I thought you said..."". Still had the order wrong!  Whew!"
3,"The Service is great.  The food is ok.  The salsa.....horrible.  Please rethink your salsa.  Oh, and if you order a side of jalapenos they charge $1.99.  I have never heard of a Mexican restaurant charging for jalapenos.  Overall, just an ok place.  There are better options on and around Mill."
5,"Id love to give this place MORE than 5 stars!!! In Phoenix a few weeks ago I needed to planb a nice dinner for a group of 10.  I thought about a few places and wanted to come here because of the view.  (Get it? Different Point of View.....?) Anyway, while I did initially pick DPOV because of the view, I fell in love with the perfect service AND the perfect menu. There were great options for my picky group, and not one person left unhappy, or hungry.  In addition, they seem to have a pre-fix menu with a nice price tag if youre ballin on a budget.   Everything was AMAZING and its definitely one of my favorite restaurants in DC!"
4,"This place is so damn tasty.  I love a good burger and I recommend this place highly.  I dont know why I didnt give it 5 stars.. 4.5?  Ok, there we go. I ordered a mushroom Swiss burger and the thing literally melted in my mouth. You have to be careful cause you could literally inhale these things in a matter of seconds.  They are that good! A big plus that his place has is that they sell fried pickles.  I dont know of another small place like this that does.  Veddddy goood.   Thankfully this place is two blocks from my house, so easy access.. lol."
3,"Pretty ok place, right in the thick of it, I saw 3 separate arrests while drinking beer on the patio.  They have a couple different 4 Peaks Brews.  Those facts alone made it a successful endeavor.  Did I mention it was 4pm on a Friday?"
2,"Meh.  Service was friendly, and the atmosphere is bright and festive, but its pretty Americanized Mexican food.  I had a California burro ($9.49), which was a large size, and tasted OK, but for about 1/3 of the price and for about the same size, I can get a better tasting burro with the same type of ingredients at Los Favoritos.  Ive also had dishes with their Baja sauce, which tends to be too heavy tasting for me."
4,"Great, challenging course.  Well maintained. Friendly staff, marshalls, etc. ""Club House"" is still a pretty-fied construction trailer, but they now have supplies, clubs, balls etc. available. The view alone is worth the round.  Unfortunately, porta-potties are only at the practise tees, holes 5 and 13, so it isnt so lady-friendly. The bar cart does make its way around, however and you are given bottled water in your cart."
5,"There are no words to express the value of the quality of service that you receive from  Tina Yraguis Hands 4 Healing  therapeutic overall body care.  The value  of knowledge of the body, the commitment of service, the excellence of research for each individual client. The degree that she possesses cannot be measured with a dollar amount because no dollar amount can beat this value. It is value what goes far beyond what you receive each and every time you see Tina.   Tina is a healer and is dedicated to you.  It just doesnt get any better! Carol Taylor-Tassone Erica Elizabeth Tassone"
4,"My girlfriend and I love Crust and frequent here often. They have amazing pizza, the Rustica is enough for two, and we usually split a salad. They have whole wheat crust, upon request, which is actually really good. There service is awesome and we always enjoy ourselves when we visit. They have a great wine selection by the glass and by the bottle. Our favorite is the red blend that is very unique, let it breathe though. They also have many flat screen tvs so you can keep up with what ever sporting event is on. The atmosphere is casual, but it can get noisy if the restaurant is full. The only time weve ever had poor food is when we do pick up. Its always been hit or miss then. Weve never had a bad experience actually visiting the restaurant, which explains the 4 out of 5 stars."
4,"Weve got another first timer here...! I am just as shocked as the next person that after many years in Seattle, I had never had Bubble Tea.  Gasp!  You can get it almost as readily as Starbucks.  I learned its also called Boba and maybe one other name.  Its all the same to me.  Same-same. I had my first boba initiation at the recent Office Hours with Gabi.  I was completely overwhelmed by the options presented to me: what type of chewies (for the record, that term just doesnt seem right), base drink, optional flavorings, etc.  It was a lot for this gal to handle.  Luckily, Alica B. was at my side leading me down the boba path.   She helped me pick out a concoction of Thai iced tea and regular boba.  Gotta start with the original boba, right?  She ended up with a coffee drink with coffee jellies.  I feel like Im now ""in the know"" because she asked for the coffee jellies and even though they werent on the menu, they indeed had them.  Thats a little insiders tip from me to you.  Wink wink.  She was so excited I thought she was going to consider this woman the Patron Saint of Boba and commence worship on the spot. I was surprised to find how incredibly filling boba is.  I wasnt hungry for hours!  Overall, it was good.  I dont see myself craving boba, but if someone wants to go, then Im in.  Ill check out the jellies in my next go round.  If the craving is boba, I would definitely recommend this place!"
2,"Terrible food. Pretentious service. Stale bread brought to table. Mole was grainy and tasteless. On the upside, great tequila selection! At least you can get loaded and pretend the dinner you just waited too long for and paid too much for was worth it."
5,"I would typically never write a review for strbucks because it is all the same.  I mean that in the best possible way as i have come to expct a certain level of service and quality.  Starbucks is amazing for kids as my dzughter oly drinks warm milk and so anywhere i see a starbucks i can ge a kids milk.  I have had  great serive at this location.  Since i could not find the starbucks at the asu bookstore location, i am using this review too but really the five stars is for this location. I wanted to give the asu location one star.  My barista NOEl today was exceptionaaly rude. She did not know how to make nor ring up a kids drink and when it  came up wrong instead of offering to fix it told me that  is how it is done.  If my other experiences weren t so good with starbucks i would have switched over to petes.  If you happen to be the starbucks manager at the asu bookstore location too, NOEL definitely could use some more training in both drink preparation and customer service. Sorry for the spelling areas but i am typing on my iphone and havent found the pellchck option yet."
3,"If Star of India (SoI) is named after the historic ship that set sail from Great Britain to India then it is best to declare at the beginning that there is nothing worth remembering about this place and there is little that keeps you afloat in the morass of ordinary fare.  Like many other Indian restaurants in the valley, the smell of Indian cooking hangs in the air and permeates every piece of furnishing. The place does not disappoint when it comes to service, it is warm, quick and attentive. The complimentary papadums (Indian flatbread) with homemade chutneys (condiments) is usually the high point of a meal at SoI.  Experiences with the order could be as follows:  Gobi Parantha (Indian bread stuffed with cauliflower)- The real thing is meant to be fluffy and served with butter but the SoI parantha resembles a topping-less thin crust pizza.  Lamb korma- The gravy is thick, nutty with a lot of authentic flavours but the meat tastes pre-cooked.  Chicken biriyani- it is difficult to describe the God-food that is biryani but SoI manages to serve a new variation which is nothing more than chicken pieces thrown into a mishmash of rice and vegetables.  Disheartenment with the over-priced, sub-standard food could lead to a decision of not ordering dessert.  Finally, as observed in other reviews and the menu, if you visit this place then stick with the tandoori stuff and Chefs specialities. However in that case the excitement of an extensive menu will be lost."
5,Had lunch at Bliss again ... still yummy as always! This time I had the ceasar salad and their shoe string  parmesan cheese fries. I still recommend this place for lunch or dinner.
5,"I have been here 3 times, and find it unique to Phoenix with a country French ambience without being ""cute-sy."" The patio is one of the loveliest we have here in Scottsdale. My daughter and I celebrated an early Mothers Day here recently. We were seated in just the right spot on the patio to tuck my grandson and his stroller in a corner next to the table. We splurged on some white sangria for lunch.....so pretty it had its photo posted on Facebook. The Brie and Carmelized apples also came with grapes and strawberries and it was a very large serving of cheese. It could easily be a meal or feed 4 as an appetizer. We actually ran out of bread, because the Brie wheel was a nice large serving. The smoked ham sandwiches on crusty baguette are so good that I am craving them a few days later ....we used the still-warm gooey Brie on them, too. This place is just special! Plan an event, take a guest. It is a spot that will make it memorable. This was my first lunch as a new Grandmother with my daughter. My daughter is from the beach area in SCal, and she was wowd. Thanks for the memories.......beautiful day."
4,"The ""Shoe Dog"" experience was quite fun and entertaining!  It assists in finding the right shoe for your foot...and pretty accurate!

5,"stopped here on our way home on a road trip.  if i had known, i wouldve stopped on the way out, too.  the bear name drew me in (and the assumption that a diner would have chocolate malts).   the food was fantastic.  boyfriend ordered ""bobs big bear burger"" and it was probably the biggest hamburger ive seen in person.  apparently it was delicious (how he ate the whole thing, i will never know).  i ordered some sort of burger basket combo, featuring a much smaller cheeseburger (which was delicious), hearty portion of fries (which were ok), and the chocolate malt was only $2.99 (instead of $4.50-ish)  with the combo.  And it was one of the best chocolate malts Ive ever had.  And the prices were reasonable.  And I actually loved the kitschy bear theme.  Cant wait for another trip that takes me through Phoenix (and I never thought I would say that)."
4,"We went here after the Rainbow Festival and it was such a great place! The food was great, the service was awesome and the patio is a great place to enjoy your meal! Bliss has made it to my list of places to eat downtown!"
5,"After a second visit, the chicken was a little dry and lacked flavor. Quite a contrast to my first visit. Still enjoyed the meal, but wasnt as impressed with the chicken. Ill have to go back to see if it was a fluke."
5,A very professional company that takes the time to deal with you on a personal level.   With great reassurance from Nate and his team they were able to handle the short sale of our home with very little stress and in a timely manner. They really helped when we thought no one could.  From beginning to end we were always kept informed and they got the job done.
2,"If your products werent my number two love I would abandon you!!!  I only say this of this location!  One associate was SO snotty I wanted to punch her, and Im not a violent individual!  Fashion Square receives my loyalty..."
5,"My husband and I have been going to the Touch of Thai for years. We meet up there at least twice a month for a lunch date. On special occasions we take friends and family there for dinner. I love the wait staff - especially Nick! His wonderful sarcasm and jokes always make our day!  For the amount of food you get at lunch at the price they charge - you cant beat it. Everything is homemade and tastes fresh. #3 Yellow Curry is my hubbys favorite. Rich coconut based sauce with yellow curry. The chicken is tender and the potatoes and carrots are cooked perfectly. I venture off and try things from time to time. The food is spicy. I like the incorporation of fresh herbs into the dishes. The soup served with lunch is always yummy and changes from time to time. We always get a side order of spring rolls. You need to try these! I like the Pad Thai as well as the #5 and #7 lunch specials. Meals are served fairly quickly.  Sometimes we have to get up and refill our own water glasses however I find this to be a wee bit charming. Feels like I am home. If you go there on a regular basis the servers remember you, have your order into the kitchen before you even are seated, and always say hello and smile."
4,"Food is great, but they use to let you get the happy hour specials for take out, but not anymore. I love their prime rib burger, if you have a few extra bucks to spend on the best burger in the world than go here."
4,Great flatbreads and atmosphere
4,"Itd be nice to see this chain grow and get a little more traction in the Valley.  The shoestring fries are pretty good, the burgers have a great seasoning.  Maybe the burgers could be a little bigger, I guess, but Im nitpicking. The real star for me is the custard, and my favorite is picking up a good chocolate shake.  The stuff is very rich and a sugar coma waiting to happen.  Shakes arent the cheapest, but theyre pretty unbeatable mood boosters. Ill have to change my review once I try more on the menu, but for now, Im a fan, and I enjoy the place.  Good fast food and doesnt disappoint."
1,Filthy place.  Bad tasteless food.  Rude waitress.  Yuck!!!!
3,As good as it gets for Chinese food in Surprise right now.
4,"We popped in here for a brew while walking around heritage square. The waitstaff is very friendly and attentive. Note: if you just want a brew - you can order it inside! We went with a local Hefe and it was great! The options for noshing look great, but we were headed for dinner so we didnt get a chance to try them out! See you there soon!"
3,"Ive been here a number of times and the food is always good.  They have a fantastic selection of cheese and its a great place to try boutique cheeses.   The current rating is due to the service we received last night.  The hostess was very friendly but our waitress was sorely lacking.  After our food arrived and two in our party still needed silverware, we informed her and she never returned with silverware.  We ended up stealing it from a neighboring table.  She made a bleak attempt at humor telling us that one of the cheeses was a water-based calorie-free cheese when were pretty sure its a triple cream.  If shed had an iota of personality, the joke might have flown.  But, it fell flat and left us confused wondering if wed really just ordered calorie free cheese.   We enjoyed our evening anyway.  The service could just use a little work."
4,"This is my favorite Pho place in Arizona.  The menu is diverse, an the staff is friendly.  They will answer any and all questions.  Ive heard them giving ""lessons"" on how to eat pho several times.  The food is great, and the keep the drinks filled.  Ive never had a complaint, and Ive been there numerous times.  You will not be disappointed."
3,"Alright, so how does it go from being a 1-star (actually, less than that) to being a 3-star review? Simple, they seem better than the last time I was working/shopping here. I went here the other night to help my boyfriend find an interview outfit and noticed that the store had a handful of the same employees as they did back in the Summer, but certain areas of clothing had been moved around. Despite all the moving and switching around they must have done, the store seemed really clean and in order. In fact, I really have no issues with this store except one, teeny tiny, little problem...the check out girl! I remember her from when I worked here and she gave me attitude when I needed to ask her something. Turns out, it wasnt a one time thing.. shes just a rude person. On this particular night, there were only two check out girls and a line of about 15 people. My boyfriend and I were making seperate purchases and knew one of us was going to get her. I happened to get the friendly one, but before we each paid for our items, we were watching as the rude girl didnt crack even ONE half-hearted attempt at a smile. We listened as she rudely explained to some elderly ladies why a certain item was marked on sale but the same item was normal priced. They wanted to make sure they werent paying too much/too little and her explanation?: ""That ones been the store longer."" It didnt make sense to them, or to those of us in line watching, but she kept getting huffy about it until they dropped the issue. She shoved peoples items in bags and practically threw them at them and said, again without trying to fake some kind of customer service, ""Have a good night. Bye. NEXT!"" Yuck. My cashier was slightly more frienldy, but still not awesome. It was obvious she was having a long night (afterall, she was stuck at the register with the Ice Queen), so it was understandable. Also, I didnt catch her name, but the girl working in the dressing rooms was really sweet and kept greeting everyone that came by.  I had to call this location to get the name of the manager for something I was filling out on a form and I was told theyve got a new manager. Thus, I know why this jumped up two stars. It could have been four, but certain things they havent fixed (rude cashier girl) have kept this review at a solid three."
4,"Okay, it almost seems a shame to burst the bubble of the positive reviews of this place, but I just have to.  Im not an Indian food expert, but I am a serious enthusiast and Ive eaten at dozens of Indian places on three continents, not to mention my family being from the vicinity of that area of the world and therefore having grown up on curry and rice and all things spice. We went here for lunch yesterday (Sunday), thanks to a Yelp/Aloqa recommendation after wed had a romp at Estrella Mountain Park and were starving. The place was almost deserted at 1pm, with only one other table occupied - fair enough. We went for the buffet. And I have to say, it was simply ""okay"". The buffet didnt have a particularly wide variety of stuff - several items were cheap regulars such as the saag and the dhal - spinach and lentils for the uninitiated. They did have aloo zucchini, never seen that before - tasted okay, about as good as Id have been able to make it (and thats actually not a compliment). No lamb dishes - disappointing, but unfortunately this is also rare. Flavorwise, I found it boring and unspectacular. Saag is saag, tandoori chicken is tandoori chicken, except their chicken was very light on the tandoori smoke flavour. None of the food left the slight zing on my tongue that it should have. Rice was okay, but then you typically cant go wrong with cooking basmati (although another reviewers mileage apparently differed on this count). We had our almost-3-year-old along and he did have a little rice, chicken and beef - it was his first real curry and thus a pretty substantial milestone for us. Then the wife went to get a little kheer and a gulab jamun ball. The kheer was watery but tasted okay - compared unfavourably to the sabudaana kheer at India Palace. The jamun ball was almost completely solid - you had to press real hard with a fork to cut it, normally theyre nice and soft and soaked. However, another one I got was normal - so it was just the luck of the draw there. Beef curry was nice, although the first piece I ate was mainly fat - whatever, you get that and I dont mind it. The fried pakoras can normally be cut through with a fork. These you had to saw through with a knife - not great, chewy to the point of almost being crunchy. No samosas in the buffet. The naan was unusual. Ive had a LOT of naan before and this stuff was the uncommon kind, not thick and pita-ey but instead a little more like a roti. It tasted very fresh - we had plain and also garlic - and the wife really liked it. Kid did too. I personally prefer the other sort of naan - softer and a little more substance to it, but this one had merit regardless. However, it took at least fifteen minutes after our food was served before the naan arrived. All up, middle of the road as far as Im concerned, although the wife quite liked it. Note that this is for the buffet only - we did not have a-la-carte and perhaps the to-order cooked food may have tasted better. Ive had better buffets - the best one in Phoenix west of the 17 IMO is India Palace - a wider variety, a lot busier (as a result, Im sure) and more flavourful food. Admittedly, I havent tried any other Indian places south of Bell but west of the 17 except for Sutra. Bell appears to have most of them? I would normally have given this place a flat three stars, but Im going to give it an extra half and round up for a few reasons. Firstly, the waiter was real nice and very attentive - up to the standard of a typical US chain place, rather than the silent wanderers with the Easter Island statue facial expressions at other buffets who do no more than refill your water and clear your dirty dishes every fifteen minutes or so. He was asking us how we were doing, offered refills of my wifes iced tea at appropriate times etc. Spot on. Next, theres a buffet discount where all kids under 10 are $5 - however, we noticed that they appropriately knocked the price down to $3.50 for us, unbidden and I guess for the simple reason that he was set up in a high chair and obviously only ate 1/4 of a breakfast bowl worth of food in total. Third, the place had nice decor (although I was a bit concerned there were no tablecloths, with my kid banging his plastic sippy cup and spilling sh1t all over the tabletop) and thankfully they didnt have sh1tapple wudda-wudda-waa-waa pretentious bhangra muzak playing in a cheap attempt at making you feel like youre actually in India. Id eat here again, but only if Im in the area and DYING for Indian food. It simply didnt measure up, either buffet-wise or flavour-wise. For first-timers, I can see how they would have enjoyed the experience - clean seating area, Americanized flavours and a good waiter. My experience, however, has been burned in over almost four decades and Ive kicked the tyres of more cuisines from this area of the world than I can recount, especially Indian. Three and a half, rounded up to four, Seacrest out."
5,"From the moment we walked in the door we were treated like celebrities. I wish I was one after leaving here! The food was some of the best Thai weve ever had, and I live in Chicago and have tasted dishes more than a dozen different authentic Thai restaurants.  We never were without a glass of water or a full glass of wine. I wish I lived here so I could make this a regular stop during my weekly Thai and Sushi cravings.  The Tilapia was out of this world - topped off with a delicious medley of mint, onions and lemon leaves. I highly recommend the Spring Rolls - very fresh and tasty! Give this place a try - you wont be disappointed."
4,Fantastic atmosphere. Very Very friendly staff. Food presentation was spot on. We had drinks and a Brick Oven Flatbread (cheese) and it was delicious. I cant wait to go back and try a full entree. They had a Salmon dish on the menu I am going to try when I return. I was staring at other dishes and they looked mouth watering.
1,"I ate here for the first time a few weeks ago on a Friday night/Saturday morning after seeing a show at the Tempe Improv. I came in around midnight and the place was not that busy. The waitress was pretty nice (did everything expected for a waitress) and the guy who I thought was the manager was easy to talk to. However, those are the only two good things I can say about the restaurant. I ordered the BBQ wings and they were TERRIBLE. The flavor was very bland and half cold. The blue cheese I ordered was quite watery as well. I also sat by the kitchen and noticed that a guy in the back was washing a stool in a sink near where the food was made. Needless to say, I wont be eating at Hooters anytime soon."
2,"They get 2 stars, for the pickles.  So Im from Jersey and was very happy to see all the NYC/Jersey stuff in this place.  The walls were covered in things from my state so I figured they know a thing or two about real NYC pastrami.  I was very wrong! This had to be the worst pastrami I have ever had! Whats with the places in this area advertising themselves as either being a NY style deli or NY style pizza? I mean, I know were the most awesome people in the country and our food is the best, but dont say youre like us unless you really are! Maybe if youve never had the real thing, you think this is quality? This sucks giant donkey balls and Im sorry I ever tried it! Really, instead of spending all that time trying to make your place look like Jersey and NYC, spend that time practicing making good food.  That, not decor, gets you good reviews!  If youre from the East coast and looking for authentic NYC food, avoid this place. They also claim their bagels are just like NY...yea, I wont be trying those!"
4,"I love the kitsch of this place! Bears bears everywhere! Black Bear Diners are usually found in small to medium sized towns, but for some reason this one is smack in the middle of urban sprawl. So not complaining though, because it means I dont have to drive to the middle of nowhere to enjoy their old-timey newspaper-menu and awesome pot roast!  Their fare is strictly comfort food and always well-prepared. The full portions will fill an average 200lb guy, so its nice that smaller folk like myself have the option of getting the small (or ""senior) portion!  Save room for their personal-sized pies...you wont regret it!"
5,"Hands down the best breakfast Ive ever had, anywhere. It definitely feels like home cooked breakfast. Ive never been to this place on the weekend when it isnt packed out the door. Im not the only person that loves this place!"
4,"Ive been going here off an on since 2004, and have had pleasant experiences. It seems like the same guys since the first time I went, which to me tells me they have experience and a loyalty to their company and customers. They are always nice to me, and try to explain whats going on with my car as well as present me with options for repair. They are also great about trying to save me money by doing things like contacting manufacturers about warranties, offering me packaged deals that cover what i wanted anyways, and providing discounts.  One time I went for a package deal that was actually cheaper than the individual things i needed done for my 60,000 mile checkup. Part of the package included new filters, but since I had just switched them out myself and they were still in practically new condition. They went ahead and gave me the new filters, saying that I didnt need new ones, but i paid for them. I really appreciated this even if they only cost a few bucks each.  Another time, it was slightly unfortunate in that it took a very long for them to get to my car and complete all the repairs/order parts etc. I waited patiently and didnt complain and they were very grateful. They kept thanking me for my patience and apologizing for the wait. When the bill came they had given me every special and discount available including an overall discount on the bottom line for the wait. Its not often that companies will give you anything without you having to bitch. While the wait was unfortunate, they did what they could to make it an overall good customer service experience.  Overall good customer service, and a place that I trust.  **as an added bonus, the mesa library is within walking distance."
3,"Its a hotel bar, so expect typical hotel pricing on drinks.  They have some good tapas to choose from, ask for the calamari, but a grilled version (off the menu)... its REALLY good.  Ive had a few of their drinks there, but I stick to the mojitos, but had plenty of others that were just as good."
5,"As far as indie record stores, this is truly as good as it gets in the valley. It is a breath of fresh air because it is a REAL record store, and you can sample CDs along the wall to get your music fix. I love how they have a list of recommended new releases. I definitely refer to them if my music is getting stale. Recently, my husband and I have bought albums from Beirut, Andrew Bird and Iron & Wine. They have everything your heart desires- so go and get you some! OH- and I just found out you can buy concert tickets there, and they usually give out a free ""Magnet"" magazine with each purchase. Woohoo!"
3,"I was up for a cold sugary drink before getting onto my flight so I walked over to the Wendys next to this place. The guy at this place looked bored so I walked over to his counter to buy the drink. He was quite friendly and very prompt to charge me for the drink, which was quite a bit cheaper than the same drink at Wendys. He also said I could either use the Coke machine or the iced tea dispensers. He had two kinds of iced tea, regular and a green blackberry. I took a little bit of the green blackberry which was very refreshing and tasted pretty good. I then went over to the Coke machine to get that. The sign on the Coke machine basically said once you buy a cup, you can refill it again and again the same day of purchase. Ill remember this if I ever have a layover in Phoenix. The prices at the Starbucks in this airport would drain my wallet fast if I had to be in the airport for any amount of time."
5,"I cant believe I havent wrote a review for Teds yet! By far, one of my favorite places to go. You can get full off of some tasty food for a great price. I normally get a hot dog with mayo, onion, hot sauce and a pickle. I also like the corn dog and onion rings. I can always get a satisfying and fulfilling meal for $5-7. Love it! Can get a little crowded on the weekends, but generally all the people are pretty fast and nice."
3,This Pei Wei is consistant with its orders being correct & clean. My one wish is that the parking lot it shares with Starbucks & Sidebar were about 15 cars larger. I dont see that happening but a girl can wish cant she?
4,"I will begin by saying that Ive been wanting to try this place for months now, simply because they have a salad that bears my name. Which reminds me of my high school days, when the internet was new and I spent an afternoon with a friend visiting websites that also had our name. Most ended up being adult sites, but tonia.com* was an Asian company that had my name written in a fantastic logo. I wonder what it means.  Anywho, not only does the salad live up to its given name, but Moto is now on my backup sushi rotation. Reasonably priced and of good quality, I was extremely full by the time I ate only half of my dinner. The Tonia salad I actually had for lunch a day later, and was very filling and delicious. I can only imagine what it wouldve been like eating it the same night. Had it not been as great, I wouldve never came back and written to the owners, demanding the salad change to a lesser awesome name, maybe one more common or boring. My to go order was ready exactly when they said it would and I was in and out the door in minutes. Ill be back. *I have no idea if this is still the same site anymore. I am not responsible for where the link leads.. now.. or in the future"
3,"Great location, super cool conversion of an old gas station. My only gripe would be that barista didnt rinse portafilter before pulling my espresso shots , thus my cappuccino tasted burnt. This is however a common problem at most indy coffee places."
4,"The biggest tip for Last Chance is to go in with an open mind about what to buy.  Inevitably, if youre looking for rainboots and remember seeing a ton the last time you were there, there wont be a single pair to be found when you return.  This happened to me recently -- but, instead of the boots, I found an unopened package of Spanx (marked down from $36 to $7.97), olive-colored DKNY tights for $.97, and a pair of Hunter knee-high boot socks for $4.97 (for when I eventually do find the rain boots).  I wasnt really looking for any of these finds, but couldnt resist.  You just never know what will be there -- I saw one woman toting around three life-sized cardboard stand-ups of Twilight characters.  Go with the flow, and dont get too focused on one particular brand or item."
4,"Fresh and simple!  Tastes great!  Worth the drive!  The burgers are like the ones you make at home!  I had the sweet potato fries, highly recommended."
4,"The wifey and I went here last night and it was pretty good. I had some pork dish that was amazing and she had filet mignon tacos that were delicious as well. I really should have taken better note of the exact dish name I had but alas... I did not.  Anyways, great atmosphere, friendly staff and really good food. The only reason Im not giving them a 5 is because they charge for chips and salsa and their salsa was pretty weak. By weak I mean not spicy. Come on, put some peppers in there!"
5,North Glendales cool new  hangout.  Formerly Cactus Willys.  Completely remodelled!  Follow us on facebook at Justin Willys!
4,"Ok...this place is *REALLY* outdated...HOWEVER, the food was great.  The Veggie plate was gone fast (barely got to taste any of it ... wife loved it) and my Gryo plate was very good as well.  This is the ONLY other place that Ive been to where the Felafel was great!  Ive been to only one other place..."
1,"Pros:  -No breed restrictions on dogs -Washer and dryer in unit Cons:  -Awful and idiotic leasing staff. Forms will be missing or prepared incorrectly. -Rude and inadequate maintenance (be prepared to supply your own tools half of the time) -Trash divers daily that no one does anything about -No on-site security (you can call after 9 pm for a ""courtesy patrol"" but it takes them hours to arrive) and the front gate is NEVER closed -Vandalized cars  -A MURDER (this was the location of the man who set his pregnant girl friend on fire) -The main pool is beautifully maintained and clean. The 3 other pools are small, dirty, and frequently closed.  -Bug infestations in most apartments -Dogs kept on patios 24/7 (a clear violation of the lease) so their barking can be heard by all -The basketball court and tennis courts are never available, as they are constantly used by kids to bike ride on with the encouragement of the apartment staff -Tons of potholes! Driving through the parking lot requires excellent shocks and there is minimal guest parking -The apartments have less insulation than a cardboard box. Freezing in the winter, sweltering in the summer. Nothing is fitted correctly to its frame, either.  If you can afford a better place, I highly reccommend it."
3,"DVAP.... You have to go at least once in your life. It really is a neat place with alot of history.  The service is great, it appears to be family run.  The food is good. Better then Dennys but not as good as Mimis.  I had the all u can eat of beef ribs, lasagna, meat loaf, cat fish, chicken, mashed and diced potatoes, stuffing, rice, homemade apple pie, etc and salad bar. I know I am missing a bunch of stuff they had but you get the drift.  They run specials on Prime rib and stuff so you might want to call to see what they are serving the night you go."
3,"We have been using Delias Cleaners now for nearly three years and for the most part found the experience to be very good.   Yes, like most cleaners they goof from time to time (like sometimes killing the button-downs on my dress shirts).  But, heres the difference -- theyll fix them for no charge.  Yep.  Just ask, the staff is very helpful!"
4,"Okay, since my latest review, I was contacted by the manager who expressed concern on my bad experience. Fran wanted to make sure they had the opportunity to make it right. I was impressed! I do want to say that even if the food sometimes needs a little sumptin sumptin, the customer service is Great and always has been! I give them superb credit for that & the ambiance is nice too. We went back for another try & we were satisfied. I definitely think you should stick with the thin or traditional crust, it was better. Also a note to update a previous review - they no longer have the Portobello Steak Sticks, not sure why, maybe a cost thing, but they were delicious and I will miss them! Another cool note that should be said because it cant be said about most places with an outdoor patio - they do not allow smoking in the patio dining area, which is such a refreshing change. Its nice to be able to enjoy the great Arizona weather this time of year. Thanks for that! Final words... BoomBozz is on the top of our list again"
2,"Im torn with Cream. Ive been to the usual clubs and lounges in Scottsdale enough to be sick of them, and Cream was something new. I like that Cream is emulating Vegas-style nightclubs, but its obviously trying too hard. The decor: First of all, this place is PAINFULLY tiny. Ive only been here once, and while it was half full, so it wasnt completely unbearable. But I cant imagine what it must be like when they have guest DJs and other performers in. A tiny place thats packed isnt popular. Its just... small. The walls are covered in white (leather?), the tiles are white, everything is white - I get it, white like Cream? I appreciate the commitment to the color but the theme is waaay off. The hard surfaces make the place look cold and very hospital like - I would have liked to see more smooth lines and softness in the design, more flowy like cream. The atmosphere: The dig the loud music and the techno. I get so sick of hearing the same stupid songs on the radio. I love the change in scene. Phoenix/Scottsdale is so stale in terms of music. This is a nice change. But its too loud when you cant even put an order in for your drink. I literally had to pull myself onto the bar (Im tiny, 53"") so I could give my order directly into the bartenders ear. They also had a really cool entertainment act - a girl hung from a hoop suspended from the ceiling wearing a white bikini. She was clearly talented in her hoop manipulating and was mesmerizing to watch, but like I said, this place is TINY, and there were several instances in which she was inches away from kicking people in the face. And THAT would have been worth the ridiculous cover I didnt pay (I try to find any way not to.) The drinks:  Overpriced and terrible. Maybe the bartender THOUGHT she heard me say I wanted a glass of vodka piss, because thats what it tasted like. I doubt there will be any improvements made that will make me like Cream better, but heres hoping."
4,"Beep Beep!  Whos got the keys to my jeep?  Vroooom! (Missy ""Misdemeanor "" Elliott) Food Truck Friday happens, well, every Friday in downtown Phoenix.  Located off Pierce and Central the the food truck phenomenum has arrived in Phoenix.  Thank you Great Food Truck Race on Food Network!  Actually Food Truck Friday was started by the Phoenix Street Food Coalition.  If you didnt know, Phoenix lags behind in the food truck scene like Los Angeles, New York, Portland, etc.  Who knew huh?  Yeah, like you didnt know! The area where this event happens is not very big.  Seating is a B-I-T-C (shut your mouth!) Im not even going to bring up the Shaft!  However, come early enough and maybe youll get lucky.  Some people to do the ""Im saving these seats for a friend"", thing, which really really is annoying!   Needless to say the scene is awesome!  Hot dogs, burgers, pizza, rice bowls, and cajun burritos!  I guarantee youll come back for more and to explore the different flavors!  You definitely wont have all Friday to do so, but check out their daily weekly schedule - http://www.downtownphoenix.com/blog/tag/food-truck-fridays/ - Enjoy!"
5,"Ok, Ill say this up front, I dont like chains.  There are just far too many awesome restaurants in Phoenix/Scottsdale to go to a chain. That being said, this place is amazing and the quality and consistency here is unreal.  Yes, it ""seems"" expensive but once youve eaten here youll realize that you are absolutely getting your moneys worth. So much awesome unlimited red meat. Dont let them trick you with the salad bar!  Its killer but dont fill up!  And dont be ashamed to leave your flipper thing on GREEN, the sign of meat greed. hahahahaha. Lastly, try the Tres Leches and the Key Lime Pie, out of this world."
4,"I have friends that I meet there once a month for a delicious greasy spoon breakfast and these guys never disappoint.  I am a breakfast maven so love their hash browns most of all.  If Im feeling a little decadent, I order a side of gravy with them.  Its really nice to sit outside during the cooler months and have some fries and a shake too!"
4,"My husband and I went there for lunch today and because of vegegirly C.s review about the deep fried pickles guess what we ordered??? OMG they were amazing! We ordered the cajun style and man oh man were they goooooood! We have never even heard of them but I am so glad we got them. So crispy and so hot! Mmmmm (and 1/2 priced)!!! We got greeted and seated quickly. I ordered the chicken brie sandwhich and my husband had the meatloaf sandwhich. I am not sure where the comment about small portions came from because they were good sized and we were both stuffed! The only change to the chicken brie would be to have the pears sliced thinner rather than having thick pears to bite through. Otherwise it was yummy. I also ordered the ""Arizona Iced Tea"" for the first time since they didnt have fresh mint to make my mojito. I was pleasantly surprised at how light and refreshing it was. We had the entertainment card which they didnt punch so we can use it again, and we will :)"
5,"Great service! Great Value! Best in the valley hands down!!!!  I am a second generation customer and as far as i can remember my mom has always took my clothes here, from my 8th grade promotion dress, my HS prom dress, my college graduation dress and now i take my husbands suits here!  Park Avenue has been there for all of my wonderful growing years and hopefully will be here for my future children as well!!"
5,"Beautiful little gem of a restaurant.  Great outdoor seating, amazing-truly amazing mussels.  Wholeheartedly recommend, perfect ""date night"" too."
5,Wonderful place to hangout with friends ...small and cozy. Hoegaarden white ale with chicken tikka masala pasty is my usual.
4,"Sakana is one of the few sushi places that I return to. There is usually always a wait (no reservations, which is a PITA), but the sushi is fresh, service is quick (so its not always super friendly), and the calamari salad is SO effin good. Their lunch specials remind me of something Id find in So. CA-- tasty, filling and reasonably priced. Its lively on the weekends with several tables doing sake bombs so its a fun place to celebrate birthdays."
2,"Things that might happen at Bikini Lounge: You might watch your friends dance with a bum in front of the juke box. You might drink far too many pitchers of PBR. You might throw a fit when you realize it is cash only. The Bikini Lounge is quite possibly the crappiest place known to man. I mean its in a shitty neighborhood where you might die, doesnt take credit cards, and has only bags of chips for food. So why do I keep going back? because eventful things happen here. Dont go if you want to have a quiet night with a couple of friends and go home and go to bed. Go here if you want to show up to a bar full of low lifes, order pitchers of PBR until you and your friends are all sick, then go outside and forget where you are and turn left down Grand Avenue only to find out you are nowhere near home when you get to the burned down church on 5th ave and monroe and a bum asks you for money. After that, youll get in a bike taxi/rikshaw and tell the guy you can only pay him in cigarettes and then when he agrees, have him take you to another bar, instead of home, and then you will be further than you were to begin with. When you finally do get home thanks to a caring homeless guy that actually does have money (you find this out because he has a car) and gives you a ride home. You wake up the next morning wondering why all of your cash is gone, how much you drank, and where your friends are. If THAT is the kind of night you are looking for, Bikini Lounge is IT!"
5,"Im a pho snob, my hitlist is impressive. In Olympia, I ate pho literally every single day. Test me, wannabe purists... Nam Sao is the best. The guy always working and seeming to make the food is so quick and super sweet. Great service, my drink never goes empty, and the table is set in traditional pho-joint style: a metal caddy with spoons, forks [...], chopsticks, napkins, and all the delicious condiments. The menu is enormous, so if you happen to be in the mood for something other than their glorious, never-watered-down noodle soup, you can try something else. The spring rolls, I love them. The boba tea is great too, Ive had it thicker and more rich at Pho Hoa in Oly but I like the less creamy variety served at Nam Sao.  Fast service, cheap filling meal, wonderful server.. I literally cannot think of anything bad to say about Nam Sao, except its so small its kind of hard to find if youre new to the spot. Just go to the right of Frys and youll see this little piece of heaven with its lights on, welcoming you in."
1,"Totally dissapointed.  I had purchased a coupon from TravelZoo, to try out this restaurant, which given its location I would have thought it was going to be very upscale and we were expecting a WHOLE LOT MORE.   The Service was great, but the food, not worth it.  The restaurant itself is very outdated, very 80s.   My husband and I had the crab cakes for appertizer.  They were cold when they were served.  We told our waiter, who in turn told the chef, and the message was passed back to us, that she appologized.    My Husband ordred a 12oz New York Strip ala carte for $29.95, 6 oz of that was pure fat!  and for the price you would expect to get more meat than fat!  I ordered a wild mushroom pizza, which was OK.   This place needs an over haul in a major way, if they want to make any money at the restaurant, which for a Saturday night at 7pm when we went, was empty.  I think the highlight of the meal was the bottle of cabinet!"
3,"A hand-job with gardening gloves..... I went looking for Scottsdale Auto Salon to get a hand wash tint quote on my new Mini today. Finding it out of business, I whipped out my handy-dandy Yelp iPhone app looking for a nearby alternate to at least get the wash done and found Classic Car Spa.  Expecting to pay a bit more for a traditional hand wash I was surprised to find a machine assisted process. Id spent way to long trying to locate the place (thank you Google maps) so I just opted for their supreme wash, which includes both interior and exterior detail. My son and I watched the car move through the process and saw that at least the wash part was done by hand, but they used the same mitts from the filthy truck that had gone through previously. -1 star After seeing this, I should have watched their interior detail more closely. When I got the car back there were lines of dirt in my white roof, and water spots on the accent chrome. When we got in the car there still bits of chip on the seat and floor mat from my sons spill the day, and it was obvious that the dash and interior hadnt been detailed. (Unless they refrain from using any product what so ever on the interior of the car. The dash and steering wheel were bone dry and dusty.)  - 1 star I should have brought it up to someone, but my husbands and sons hunger won over and we just left. Thankfully all of their other locations are to far out of the way to bother detouring to again. The staff was friendly, and their waiting area was pleasant with lots of drink choices, although Im not sure their waiting area was comfy enough for anything longer than a wash."
5,"Bacado. Yes, you read that correctly.... The ""Bacado"". It is a glorious concoction consisting of an avocado and bacon omelette with cheese on top and served with an English muffin and country fried potatoes. Decent black coffee and good service. Delicious."
1,"I was so looking forward to breakfast here. What a disappointment. The food is the only thing that rates any stars at all. Good ingredients cannot be completely ruined by incompetent service. The space is nice, but crowded and loud. The counter staff were indifferent. After being waved over to an open register, the fellow behind the counter took one order, then wandered off, leaving the rest of us to get back in line at the other register to order. You are given a number (or not) and left to find your own table, scrounge up your own silverware, and wait for your food to be delivered. Except that the napkins are at a completely different station than the silver, they were out of forks, and most of the tables were completely filthy. I watched a busboy randomly swipe the top of a table, sweeping crumbs onto the benches and chairs, then leave an empty drink bottle on the table before wandering listlessly off. Beverages are (apparently) serve yourself, although they didnt bother to say that when I ordered. I stood at the counter, waiting for iced tea, only to turn around and see that I was expected to get it myself. If they happen to ""run out of numbers"", then they input your name with your order. Nothing irritates me more than to have my name shouted across a restaurant. Better yet, the waiters wander from table to table looking for their customers.... ""Lisa? Is there a Lisa here?"" while your food cools. Inexcusable. The only bright point: the croque madame was tasty. Delicious bread, ham, and a perfectly fried egg. But the meager smear of bechamel and a thin slice of cheese were underwhelming. However, the ""side of fruit"" made me angry: a tiny metal creamer with 1 blackberry, a few slices of strawberry, and 2 chunks of  green apple. Insulting. Fast casual, order at the counter works well when tables are clean and set, and the food delivery is speedy and efficient. Unfortunately this place needs some work in order to make it worth your time."
2,This place made me remember why I dont live in Scottsdale anymore.
5,Primp and Blow at the Waterfront is divine! I walked out feeling like a  Super Model without spending a fortune! Great Stylists. Upbeat Friendly  atmosphere. Great Tunes and an overall GREAT VIBE!  Convenient Parking  and centrally located right near Fashion Square and Olive and Ivy. LOVE it!
4,"Ok, Ok, I know I said I would never bring my clothes here, ever again. I was having a rather busy week, so I told my Dad to drop my clothes off to the cleaners. I thought he was going to take my stuff over to Continental where I usually go, but he brought everything to Seville.  I was a little upset, but being the angel of a son that I am, I bit the bullet and smiled. I thanked him for helping me out.  When it came time to pick up my clothes, I carefully walked in (knowing I slammed them in my past review) and quietly picked up my clothes. I got home, and noticed that one of my shirts had not been cleaned properly. There was a stain on it from what I think was cola. Later that day, I drove back to Seville, and they offered to clean it once more. Flash forward to the next pickup day, the stain was still there. I asked for a manager, and it happened to be someone that seemed to be the owner. He asked how much I paid for the shirt.  They gave me a check for the FULL amount.  Its very rare that I write a review update that spans a few stars (only DeFalcos comes to mind), but Seville took my crappy situation, and made it right.  I was VERY hesitant in coming back the first time around, and it was only because I was forced to. Im glad everything worked out the way it did. Not because I got a new shirt out of it, but because I got a better experience. Way to step up your game Seville. Ill be back if Im in the area!"
4,"I really like this place. However it does suck time like no other place. Somehow evertime you are there for over 2 hrs? I usually try on 60 items to get 1 that fits well, and cry a half dozen times about being fat :( Then I cruise the little kids clothes because the mens clothes are to large for me and the womens are cut weird. One of my boobs is like a 3rd the size of the other so its soo hard to find clothes that dont make me look like a cancer survivor. Anyway, good finds here. Try the clothes on even if it says the size is smaller than you wear. A lot of times it says one size but is really another. My girlfriend bought 200.00 jeans for 20.00 a piece because it said they were a 24 when they were really a 27. P.S. anyone know where to find some dress vests? The womens ones are too short and make me look like I have flowing love handles and the mens vests are to big in the shoulders and ribs. I think I should try maybe a kids vest? thoughts?"
4,This would be a  great place to live at
3,A good place for bugers and fries.
1,"Went last week, and ordered a dozen variety. I didnt care for any of them, very dry, the frosting wasnt very good,even my 9 yr old daughter spit her cupcake out!"
1,"I had received an email from a student retention telling me that I still owe money for the time that I had taken classes (two weeks) although these fools canceled my financial aid. I will sue this school if they even attempt to collect money from me and I have withdrawn from the classes on the right time, but this rep. told me that the withdrawal period was Jan. 11."
5,Have you ever tried the chicken rotisserie here? They go fast so you have to be lucky to get one unless you call ahead. Its not so much about the rotisserie chicken as it is about the amazing and creamy and smooth and exceptionally well balanced Garlic Sauce/spread they give you that goes along with the chicken.  Have I told you how amazing this spread is. If only I knew the recipe...I would eat it by the tub...okay maybe by the spoonfuls. Anyway...try the chicken rotisserie or the chicken taook. Heck if you dont want to eat either of those things...just ask for some garlic sauce on the side with whatever you are eating. You will not be disappointed.
4,"This place is a gem. Its a bit tucked away. It kinda felt like I was going on a bit of adventure. The restaurant was very small and oh so cozy. Just they way I likem. We had the Rock Shrimp breaded in coconut accompanied by a Thai Chili Dipping Sauce it was delicious. My main course was the Chicken breast stuffed with goat cheese, apricot, basil, spinach, shrimp and crimini mushrooms finished in a balsamic reduction glaze it was yummy. Service was on Point. I would so go again."
2,"Honestly, not that exciting. I heard a lot of hype about it from ASU friends of mine but I wasnt impressed. It was just your run of the mill Mexican food. And I didnt like that you ordered at the counter and got your chips in a paper gravy boat. The whole concept of the resturant would flow so much easier if it was set up like a regular sit down Mexican resturant. But appreantly it makes wonderful hangover food. I dunno."
4,"When Sen. Ken Cheuvront opened this restaurant, I was living in Midtown phoenix and it was at a time when a lot of restaurants in the area didnt exist. I was beyond excited of its creation.  Its a very trendy urban feel, with a nice patio on Central Avenue. Located at the bottom of Artisan condos, its not a terribly easy place to see if youre driving by. They feature an incredible selection of wines and cheeses, of which you can purchase and take home as well as nosh in the restaurant. They also feature smaller sized entrees for those who are not looking to get stuffed on greasy messes and feel sick all night. A particular favorite of mine are the ancho pork empanadas which are fluffy and crispy with a little orange in the pork. They are definitely delicious. Also great is their white pizza featuring sea scallops.  There is nothing here that is oddly unique, but everything is interesting, and it is a nice spot to hang out with friends and have a nice night out. Especially during a first friday."
4,"I think Im in love. If I only lived closer to Downtown Phoenix, Id leave my mark on the Lost Leaf in the form of a permanent intaglio of my ass cheeks on a bar stool.  Its tucked away on a side street in a humble looking home cum art gallery cum bar. It can be a little tricky to find since no sign exists, so keep an eye out for the neon lit open sign. You definitely dont want to miss out on this place by becoming frustrated after fruitlessly ducking down side streets, saying fuck it and going to The Roosevelt. While it wouldnt be a total bust, youd be missing out on the warm and inviting ambiance of the Lost Leaf. Thats really what won me over about this bar. It made me feel downright cozy, with exposed brick and wood, local artists artwork decorating the walls, and the actual kitchen serving as the bar. The main room is large enough to host a large group, but small enough to be homey. The acoustics are very good (soft talkers rejoice!) and the music playing was loud enough to add to the mood, but nowhere near the point of drowning out conversation. There are a couple rooms in addition to the main bar area that you can duck off into for more intimate conversation, as well as an outdoor patio thats a little on the small side but, super score--theres ceiling fans! I found the prices to be very reasonable and the service to be unpretentious and helpful. There are no beers on tap here, but the selection of bottles is mind bogglingly extensive. I had to ask the bartender to get me his favorite pale beer and I ended up finding out that I am also in love with a brew called 1664. Looks like a wine cooler, but manages to be respectable instead of laughable. So bring a couple friends with you and indulge one night, and then another, and another. Youll be love struck too."
5,Enjoyed the egg rolls.  So glad that they were made out of fried rice paper because I have food allergies.  The entree of BBQ beef with rice noodles was also very good.  I will be going back this weekend with the hubby for sure.  Very clean and nicely decorated restaurant.  Very nice waitress. The restaurant smelled really good too: spices maybe?  A bit warmer than I would like inside.  Maybe they need to turn up the A/C.
4,"Sure the food is good, but out of my last 20 take out orders they got it right maybe once.  The people making the food look so high you would think you were at Cheba Hut, but I just love that damn Broccoli and Wisconsin Cheese soup!  Their fresh dark rye bread is always great. I enjoy the Italian quite a bit and the wife LOVES their tuna salad.  Great healthy place for food if they arent too high to get your order right."
4,"My daughter and I had a couple of the beef and lamb gyros.  They were wonderful.  The meat was tender and juicy,  the bread was soft and pliable.  The only thing that I could find wrong was the tazeki sauce could have used some more spices, it was kind of blah.  We would go back.  Service was great too."
5,"Please give this place a try when youre making your next stop at Pita Jungle. This restaurant seems to be very underrated and overlooked. We went on a Wednesday night around 7:30pm and it was empty while Pita Jungle was packed. Just the two of us on the patio, which was very nice. The interior and atmosphere are great. Nice tables & chairs, candles, shelves with wine bottles and art, and a very nice bar. An Iranian family owns the restaurant and cooks everything themselves. Thats the first sign of a high-quality establishment. They were incredibly nice to us and brought us whatever we needed. They gave us some good suggestions, like their Iced Black Tea, which is fantastic. It has a few other elements to it including Lavender. They brought us extra pita when we ordered some appetizers as well without us even asking. For our appetizers, we tried the hummus and the tabooli. The hummus was very creamy but a little plain. We wished there was more flavor or spice to it. Not a big deal. That was the only part of our meal that was not 5 stars, but 4 stars. The tabooli....ridiculous. Ive never been a fan of tabooli. It usually has too much parsley. But their version was balanced perfectly. For an entree, I tried the Chicken Shawarma and we split a side of Basmati rice with saffron. A huge plate of rice with great seasoning. The saffron and olive oil gave the fluffy rice great texture. The Shawarma was fresh and delicious. The chicken was cooked and seasoned nicely. For dessert, we tried the Persian vanilla ice cream with rose water and saffron as well as the Baghlava. The ice cream was some of the best weve had. Great flavor. The Baghlava was a great complement to the ice cream. A nice sweetness from the honey and the flaky dough was great. So in summary, great atmosphere, great owners, out-of-this-world food, and very affordable. Everything we had came to about $32. We will return many times in the future because their menu is very promising. Just wish their name fit the type of place that it is. The current name makes it sound like just another Middle Eastern restaurant, which it definitely is not."
5,"This isnt your typical Mexican restaurant that puts cheese and sour cream on everything. The food here is light, simple, and fresh. We started out with the guacamole which was amazing. My sister doesnt even like mandarin oranges but it tasted so good in the guacamole she was eating it like it was going out of style. The salsa that came with it was the bomb. One was a spicy red salsa and the other one was a tomatillo salsa. The green one was so good I wanted to drink it. I ordered the chorizo and eggs and my sister ordered a couple of tacos with rice and beans. Everything tasted great and I even had room for dessert after my meal. We had some kind of carmel, banana, crepe thing. It doesnt look like much but it was one of the best desserts Ive ever had. Gallo Blanco is my new obsession."
5,"Chicken wings and cheeseburger meal... Yummmayyyy ever since ive moved away from arizona, i can honestly say that china grill is what i miss most.. their chicken fried rice is really good and so is their cheeseburger.. their general tsos chicken extra spicy is my bfs favorite.. almost everything is good here!!"
5,"WOW this place is good!  SO good!  And not just yummy good, but intrinsically good.  Check out their amazing list of environmentally responsible business practices - http://essencebakery.com/essence_bakery_environmentally_friendly.shtml !   That, and its cute.  And it tastes Yummy!  And they are SO nice!  SOOO nice!  And their deserts are just disgustingly cute and beautiful and freaking good.  I almost bought the mini box of 4 cupcakes for just $3.50.  Bite sized so not too bad, but if I bought them today theyd be gone before I got home.  I got their grilled cheese w/ mozzarella, basil and tomato on grilled buttery brioche bread with a light and tasty green salad on the side.  It will be hard to not come here every week.  I love that all the drinks are refillable - and its up to you to refill them.  Coffee, tea or soda, just walk on up and fill your glass.  And I love that its all so fresh and local!   Important note - You order at the counter, they give you a number and bring out your food.  If youre paying w/ debit card, they will ask you if you want to include a tip.  That threw me.  Id been in the place less than 2 minutes - how do I know if its worth the tip - or how much of a tip its worth??  Bring some cash or plan to deal w/ that question accordingly."
5,"After 6 years of searching I have finally found Laura!  My brows have never really been ""bad"" per se, but not great either...I have been searching for someone to show me the hidden potential of my natural arches, and Laura did just that.  After only two visits she has groomed my brows into perfect shape and balance. Its funny how such a small change can make such a big difference!  I also enjoy the quiet and private suite with the pretty chandelier to look at during my appointments...and she always has great music playing in the background too! Thanks Laura!"
5,Excellent service and food.  Best tex-mex in the valley.
4,"This is my first dinner stop anytime Im in Scottsdale, and always makes me look good when I recommend it. This time, the standouts were the ceviche, the crab queso, the lamb adobo, and the  Cadillac marg.  Tablemates had other dishes they raved about. Noteworthy notes: Ive not yet sat on the patio, but I cant explain why.  It looks awesome. The margaritas are sufficiently stiff.  Theyre not my preferred carburetor cleaning strength, but neither are they simply jazzed-up lemonade or those super-acidic-1.0 pH version you get some places. The service was a little lax this time, less attentive than before, and thats the only reason Im not giving LS a 5 this time. If youre after Mexican when in Scottsdale, this is the first place to point your ride."
5,"What a beautiful hotel! The Clarendon is truly one of a kind. The staff goes above and beyond to make sure you have everything you need...and extras :) The pool area is gorgeous and the atmosphere is delightful. I had the opportunity to meet the owner, Ben Bethel. What an astonishing young man he is! I dont know which is more impressive, his efforts to make the hotel as ""green"" as possible or the fact that he helps guests with their bags as they walk through the door. I cant wait for another excuse to stay at the Clarendon again!"
3,"Im not a woman and I dont read People magazines at the gym so Im not sure Im really the qualified demo for this place. Nonetheless, in spite of all the hype and hyperbole, its a good cupcake.  When the Olive Oil Vanilla Cupcakes from the Olive Oil mill are too far away, this becomes the cupcake backup.  Especially the vanilla. Id give this place a better review but I dont because I consider the cupcake to be the ""Rodney Dangerfield"" of desserts.  Too many far better post meal options come to mind before Id waste my valuable calorie allotment on a cupcake."
4,"Green is pretty tasty with high marks for the strawberry soy shake. I do agree with the poster below that some items are hit/miss. My ""Artichoke dip"" was way WAY too spicy (I could not eat it). My eggless eggrolss"" were tasty but ..fluffy. They came with a sauce that i enjoyed.  This is one of the essential places for Veg food in the Phoenix area."
5,"Im glad I bought my tickets back in August when the event was first posted.  Im not sure the organizers knew what an amazing turn out they would have but the event was sold out so tickets were not available at the door.  We arrived at 11:15 (doors opened at 11) and while standing in line to get in there was a staff person checking to make sure we all had tickets and letting people know that if they did not, the event was sold out.  Once inside it was a sea of cupcakes!  Tiny cupcakes that were delicious!  I didnt taste one that I didnt like.  Liberty Market was my fave I think.  Espresso Carmel and Red Velvet!  YUM!!!  Cruelty Free Cakes makes delicious vegan cupcakes too!  I also liked the ones from Cry Baby Ranch. Im going to have to find them again at the 20th street Farmers Market and Old Town Scottsdale Farmers Market.  And everyone was so nice!   $10 got you all the cupcakes you could eat and water AND milk!!  And it was for two very worthy causes.  Singleton Moms and Safe Haven For Animals.  There were also raffles, a cupcake eating contest and cupcake decorating for the kids.  So many festivals these days charge you to get in and then, once inside, charge for everything else.  People cant afford that these days so it was refreshing to go to an event and not be nickel and dimed for everything.  I appreciate that.  And best of all my daughter had a great time!  There were lots of people so it was a little overwhelming for her but she loved it.  Both of us are just coming down from our sugar high.   It was great to see Gabi and Lindsey manning the Yelp booth and our very own Thomas S. helping with emcee duties!   Will I be back next year?  You bet!!  And you should come too....just make sure you get your tickets early!"
5,"Talk about an amazing experience...First off the office is well decorated and clean...the staff pleasant and helpful...Rene the hygenist is caring and gentle.  Dr. Keith is really personable and excellent at what he does.  They dont do extra work that doesnt need to be done, they are very honest.  The office takes many kinds of insurance and they are great with kids too!"
2,"Can i just say, i hate everything about this store. If youre too lazy to go to goodwill and dig it out yourself for a third of the price, then i guess this is the place for you.   If you are trying to sell anything, good luck.  Their askew sense of fashion will make most of your goods obsolete unless its tacky 80s regurgitation.  The chick actually told me that the band t-shirts i was trying to pawn were too outdated while i had a bay city rollers  and rockos modern life shirt in my hand off their rack. They are incredibly overpriced, the staff has an elitist air for some reason (which you think would be hard to pull off in a tutu, leggings, and cowboy boots). Saving grace, they have some killer old punk and skateboarding t-shirts on the cheap for guys and gals. But the only time i even go here is when the boyfriend decides to go thru eastside records vinyl catalog in its entirity.  its like a platos closet for lady gaga."
4,"This place is an amazing little find. It serves fresh, delicious noodles for next to nothing. The absolute best part of this place is that you get to pick the kind of noodle you want meaning you can try your favorite dish multiple times while changing it up!"
5,Love Love Love!  All you need to do is order dessert here. It comes in small shot glasses & the flavors explode in your mouth..
5,"Not exactly what I expected ..................I liked it.  I was thinking some sprawling ranch house with wood floors and saw dust everywhere, maybe some old west artifacts on the walls and grumpy old waitresses.  What I got was a cool little funky building, with cool interior and neat things on the walls. More of a sports bar atmosphere with a good sized dining area. Killer staff and great food.  I had a burger, I believe flat grilled, cooked medium rare and I could tell it was good beef. They said they grind it themselves. The fries were great as they are a fresh cut type. The beans were different. They were a lighter vinegary type of bean with onion and bacon. I liked them but could not eat the whole pot that came out.  It ended up being a little expensive. 9 for the burger and Fries, 2.50 for the drink and 1.50 for the beans. Tax and tip it was an 18 dollar lunch."
3,"This review is for the JCPenny portrait studio responsible for the ""Christmas Blessings"" Christmas card that graced my familys and co-workers mailboxes this past holiday season.      My girlfriend and I were going for a ""Step Brothers"" pose so we had to look the part. I guess the look wont be in any Vogue or GQ magazine this year. No, youll have to go back to the time when Circus Magazine was popular and when mom and dad went to key parties.           Our photographer was wonderful. She seemed to enjoy her job and have fun with clients ideas. However the person who helped us pick out which cards to choose was not having any of it. If you looked up awkward in the dictionary and smacked them upside the head thats what it felt like. Her sheer agony of working there oozed out from her forced smile.     Anyways, Ill just say that I am damn happy I had a coupon for a $30 package which included two 8x10s of different poses and a whompin helping of greeting cards. A package that retails at about $170.     And no, even if you pay that price,  a happy ending is not included."
4,"If you like a good burger then check this place out. They have so many options that you can choose from to make your own burger. I am usually not a fan of sweet potato fries, but these ones come with a dipping sauce that is amazing."
4,"I love this store for years now. I discovered it here. The candles are wonderful. I love the little travel sampler kit.  The yuzu bergamot moisturizer is great.  I enjoy the soaps.  This is the type of store that you just go for the product and know it is just going to cost more. Honestly it is not the much for many items: The little kits like the: - cranberry orange body wash 2 oz - cranberry orange moisturizer 2 oz - mint thyme body wash 2 oz - mint thyme moisturizer 2 oz - bamboo creme body wash 2 oz - bamboo creme moisturizer 2 oz - packaged in a reusable zippered bag all for 25 bucks.   clove soap 2 oz - honey almond soap 2 oz - lavender lime soap 2 oz - lemongrass soap 2 oz - oatmeal lavender soap 2 oz  - rosemary soap 2 oz  - rosemary & peppermint soap 2 oz - rose tangerine lavender soap 2 oz - seven seed lemon & rosemary soap 2 oz - vetivert & grapefruit soap 2 oz - wild mint soap 2 oz  - yuzu soap 2 oz for 38 bucks. - bamboo creme moisturizer 2 oz  - mint thyme moisturizer 2 oz  - lavender lime moisturizer 2 oz  - yuzu bergamot moisturizer 2 oz  - cranberry orange moisturizer 2 oz  - sweet almond & sea kelp moisturizer 2 oz  - zippered travel bag  for 25 bucks.. Why yes you just read my Stocking stuffers for myself that I just sent my husband. hehe :D   Worth trying. You will find a favorite.  Quality of their ingredients from their website: ""...using only pure essential oils, vitamins and antioxidants, and rare fruits and herbs - and never using synthetic fragrances or colors. Now, were also sourcing organic ingredients when possible, and are on track to have all of our products be paraben-free and SLS/ALS-free by mid-2010. "" Service: She was very nice and was even happier when she saw I was a little shop happy when I started putting everything on the counter. hehe. From St. Louis and loved it! TLDR:  The products are a favorite of mine. Good products and good service at this location. Great outdoor mall."
5,"Delicious salad, pizza, and wine. We got the Padre pizza which is not on the menu, but fig, prosciutto, arugula, and ricotta... so delicious!! The crust is perfect!  The best part is they have several BOTTLES of wine under $12. Yes, you could usually barely get a glass for that amount. Sold... ! We had the Four Vines ZIn that was amazing for only $10.99."
5,Fast service. Great burgers and fries. So far the Arizona burger coupled with sweet potato fries is my favorite.
4,"Im in town for business and the guy at the front desk of the hotel recommended this place and it was a definite winner! Drove up, and frankly its not in the best neighborhood but the guy in the parking lot keeping watch over the cars in the lot with a ""Security"" t shirt on put me at ease.  Sat down and was welcomed immediately and offered the fresh chips and incredibly hot red and green salsa.  Although, Im kind of a pansy when it comes to hot and spicy.  I Just ate the chips plain and they were wonderful. Had the Chicken Mole Enchiladas which were undeniably the best Ive had.  The mole sauce was perfectly made with just the right amount of chocolate.  I have the stains all over my shirt to prove it!  The beans and rice were nice accompaniments.   Everyone knows the traditional ""Mexican"" restaurants where you go in and order the # 13 and theyre all the same right?  Rositas Place is NOT this type of eatery.  The food is authentic as authentic comes and should not be missed."
1,"Closed on Sunday?  Looks like youve not only lost my Sunday dollars, but my business on Monday through Saturday too."
3,"British pubs arent my favorite places to eat, since I am a vegetarian (who eats fish occasionally), but this place was pretty good. The building was cool and full of character and the service was very friendly. Kim was a great server, even though she was doing it all alone on New Years day! She was very nice and efficient.  The food was pretty good. I got fish and chips, but I dont prefer eating fried stuff often. I do have to say, they were good though. The outdoor seating is nice, but man....those birds are lethal! We got pooped on over and over and even our water was tainted! Not The Rose and Crowns fault, but it kinda ruined our experience.  This looks like a great place to drink, hang out and even watch the game. I am sure its a fun place, but just not my favorite."
5,"Love, love, LOVE this place!  Eugenia is a genius!  Macarons = amazing.  Croissants = soft, buttery, flaky, delicious goodness.  Iced mocha is one of the best I have ever had.  My only complaint is that this place is not closer to my house or work, but thats probably a good thing because I would weigh 1000 lbs if it was."
4,"If you are looking for a serious pool experience, look no further than this hotel. You stay at this hotel for the pool and maybe the surrounding restaurants like Ricos, but especially for the pool. This pool includes: a lazy river, super slide, pool volleyball, miniature golf (yes, mini golf), a western village, at least three pools and plenty of hours of family-fun in the sun. Oh and adult kids are more than welcome too!  This hotel provides the ultimate poolside experience, so if thats what you are looking for, this is your spot. You wont find ""so Scottsdale"" peeps with their stilettos and muscles popping out of their Ed Hardy. You will find down-to-earth people and families wanting to have a good time without worrying about what they look like in a bathing suit.  The Squaw Peak property itself is pretty awesome too. I really think you could stay here and have a weekends worth of activities without leaving the property. Squaw Peak Mtn is just a hop away and perfect for a morning hike, Ive already professed my love to the pool above, they have plenty of restaurants on property including Ricos American Grill which is delicious and Hole-in-the-Wall which is fun old-western fun. They have a gift shop full of fun memorable items, they have a creamery, a general store with breakfast and snack essentials and lets not forget about the multiple tennis courts! As I said, this is a resort. This is an old school AZ resort. Its not frilly but its fun and I think Id take fun or frilly when it includes a pool like this!  PS - summer rates are incredible and start at only $89 a night. Its worth it for a staycation or if youre in town for the weekend."
3,"Not a big fan of the Boba Tea House by Lee Lee. I like their decor, very hip. However, their milk tea mix was not that great. It felt like basic sugared water. Ive had better ones over in Lollicup or Quickly in LA. Its a pretty busy location as it is next to Lee Lees, but unfortunately they definitely arent quite there yet with the competition."
5,"was i ever lucky to pick dr. karawi from a random list of doctors near my home from my insurance website. ever since i was a kid, i barely remember seeing my dentist. his hygienist came in, cleaned my teeth, then the dentist came in with his long nose hairs and big belly and bald head and stinky breath and started shoving sharp metal objects into my teeth. then he left, saying only ""hmmph"". he had a beach house in the cayman islands. dr karawi is exactly opposite of that (dont know if he has a house in the caymans though). what really, really, really surprised me was the karawi cleaned my teeth....the Dentist! he does that for all his patients. i asked him why, and he just said he likes to get to know his patients. how novel! he is extremely friendly and likeable but always professional. he will joke and talk to you about your vacations, plans for the weekend, etc, but then always keeps it serious when discussing your dental care. i sincerely appreciate his services and friendliness. we liked him so much, even invited him to our house warming party! so for excellent dental care and outgoing service, Dr. Karawi is your man. p.s. hes not bald, doesnt have long nose hairs or a big belly, and his breath doesnt stink."
4,"Went there for a second time on Sunday.  The first time I came, I was underwhelmed.  I think the problem was that I went with only one other and this time I came with 5 others.  It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon and over pitchers of Sangria ($20.00 specials on Sunday) and copious amounts of food I rediscovered the restorative quality of good food and great friends.  Had serrano ham and manchego with quince paste, pollo colonial (my favorite), lamb with mustard and mint, pan con tomate, quail with lentils and chicken drumettes.  With the exception of the drumettes (which tasted like overly fancy buffalo wings), the rest of the food was exceptional.  Small portions, yes.  A smidge pricey yet, but the communal feeling of being with your good friends in the open air sharing vino and small plates is priceless."
5,"Only 10 min away from walking distant. This is really really really good, also really really really bad. I am almost finished with trying each soynami.... So far and not a fan of the one with banana. YET EVERYTHING is.... just... just good. Place on top of a Swiss Alp let me sing, dance, and exclaiming goodness oozing.  Also i can eat one and not feel lik I am creating havoc for my metabolism to compensate. RL: NOTE: Oddly takes an unusually amount of time to get into my hands. 10min? Worth the wait, worth the walk, worth the extra chocolate ;)"
5,Good works
5,"Being a very experienced pho eater, I must say that the pho at the BlueMoon is excellent!  That, plus the pho is 50% off, so that must have added to my utility.  Veggies were fresh and the service friendly.  Oh, and the appetizer came out only a minute after ordering.  Meal was hot and came out just as we finished the appetizer. Spent a total of $13.61 (including tax) for (2) large bowls of pho, a Thai ice tea and a order of fresh spring rolls.  Our bellies were stuffed and wallets intact. Will eat here again!"
5,"My fear and avoidance of the dentist has been building for years. However, I simply couldnt put it off any longer. With trepidation I scheduled an appointment at Downtown Dental and promptly received an email back with available times. I went in not knowing what to expect. Not only had the staff already found my insurance information they made a point to call me by the name I go by rather than my formal name and that put me at ease. I sat down with Heather, the hygienist and she was so warm and friendly that I instantly felt fine confessing to her my fear of the dentist. She allayed my concerns and told me not to worry. There was no guilt trip for not flossing or drinking too much soda, which is always annoying. Then the scary part... the dental work. It was uncomfortable and I hated it, but soon it was over, it wasnt that bad and I felt a thousand times better. Dr. Berschler came over and examined me and pointed out a few cavities we needed to take care of. Then the even scarier part (or so I anticipated)...the price! But I was pleasantly pleased and relieved that the total cost after insurance was literally thousands less than Id been quoted by a dentist a year ago to take care of my problems. In fact the total cost is very reasonable; this isnt a dentist looking to take advantage of you. I couldnt have been more pleased and delighted at the friendliness and helpfulness of everyone in the office. The convenient downtown location only makes it better. I will never go to another dentist again and Im actually looking forward to my next appointment. I cant recommend this office enough."
5,"Hands down a great lil joint! Gotta get the guac, staff is awesome, way cozy and great food!"
5,Love this store!
5,Really delicious breakfast burritos! They are true Mexican-style! I get the ham and egg breakfast burrito and it comes with cheese and a fresh tortilla. They are inexpensive and really big! Im so glad I work a mile from this place! I go at least once a week!
2,"Other than the ambiance of being a  Rock & Roll restauarnt, this place isnt good.  The food sucks. I came in for a birthday party with 6 people, and not one of us actually enjoyed our food.  We had called ahead (2 weeks) to reserve a table before a game.  When we got there, the table had not even been set up.  We were 20 minutes later than planned getting to our table, and we missed 1 entire 1st inning and the top of the 2nd because it took so long to get our food."
5,"i know, i know. this gelato is a bit on the pricier side, especially when you consider that phoenix now has a bajillion gelato shops, that  each offer a million and one flavors for a few washingtons. HOWEVER, arlecchino is definitely the BEST. its worth theprice, worth the drive, and worth the parking hassle.  the owners are super nice and accommodating, and although there is a sample limit, the workers have never said no more. the flavors are classic, inventive, fresh, and authentic. plus, its such a cute, tiny little hole-in-the-wall shoppe, that you cant help but love it in all its quaint glory."
3,"Some family were in town and are Blackhawks fanatics desperate to watch the game.  This was the only place in the east valley that we could find had the NHL Center Ice package (though the girl who answered the phone had to ask somebody else (""Whats NHL?"")).  Not only were they kind enough to put the game on, they put it on a flat screen in the corner of the patio and we were able to have the sound on.  He shoots, he scores!   The shepherds pie was good, the beer was cold, and the waitress was very attentive. Ill stick with CKs or the Baseline Pub for the NFL games though.  While RTs had plenty of TVs, most of them were small old tube TVs.  My uncle asked why they werent showing the score of a basketball game, and I told him its just being cut off by the old TVs screen"
5,"We just sold the car we bought at Carmax that spawned the original review here almost three years ago. As with the purchase, the sale was ridiculously simple. The appraisal took about 20 minutes, and came in ABOVE Kelley Blue Book ""excellent condition"" trade in value -- and the car was in good - very good condition, but certainly not excellent. A fair price, and no hassle. At a car dealership. Whod have thunk it?"
4,"being a rather simpleton, i like my salads with lettuce, tomato, and oil and vinegar...my fish simply baked...my veggies raw.... the ice cream here was very tasty. full of fancy flavors and bits-o-ingredients. but i guess if you want plain ice cream, you go to the supermarket and buy a gallon of store brand. we were cruising the greenbelt at night and saw their sign for ""voted best ice cream"" by the new times, so we decided to hit this place up. its super cute and modern, but whats so great about this place is the staff.  our ""server"" was completely into the concept of ""artisan"" ice cream (only in scottsdale can a word like artisan be applied to ice cream...its not simply ""homemade""). she was super passionate and lively and gregarious, which i really like...because i know shes serving a product she enjoys herself and also wants others to enjoy.  i had the peach cobbler one and my girl had the basil sorbet. both were very delicious, but at over 6 bucks for 2 small cups, well probably have to save our dollars for the supermarket next time. if you have the cash to spare for a snack/dessert, check this place out."
4,"By FAR one of my favorite places to have breakfast. The intimate setting gives off the ""mom and pop"" breakfast joint feel you might find in a beach town. The menu accomodates for the health-conscious but breakfast-loving eater. The only reason why I knocked it down a point is the wait. Unless you go during the weekdays or early morning on the weekends, expect to wait upwards to 45 minutes. My suggestions... their egg white omelets and for those coffee lovers, you HAVE to try the BC coffee!"
5,"I picked up some brownies as holiday treats this year and they did not disappoint!  These are the richest, chocolatiest, moistest, biggest (3"" square) brownies you will find!  Im tellin ya! TOTALLY worth the drive to Gilbert - except theyre taking their own holiday break right now, so youll have to wait until after Jan. 4, 2010 to get your fix! Still, worth the drive and worth the wait!!"
4,Cool place in downtown!  Ive been to all of the iterations of the restaurant and all of them have been pretty cool.  The happy hour is a great deal and the bartenders are really nice.
5,"We are picky about food because we try to eat healthy. Owner and server were very accommodating and courteous. They took time to understand what we want and delivered on it. One gripe, we had difficulty finding it because neon sign was not working. We had a great experience."
5,I stayed at the Motel right across the street from this restaurant when I stayed in Gila Bend. I had been driving all day through the hot desert and really wanted to kick back with a cold beer and some good food. Little Italy did not disappoint!! I got a large pizza that was AMAZING!! Plus the service was great too. Fast and friendly.
4,"We get a date night rarely throughout the year, so I try and find something new when ever we get that chance. Once we made it into the restaurant we were both quite pleased with the decor and the atmosphere, little did we realize that this was just the beginning! The wait staff here is beyond friendly and knowledgeable, our server Sam was what you would consider first class in every aspect. His attention and knowledge started our evening off in such a way that I feel indebted to him!! Then comes the food....! We had a four course meal that not only included a wine pairing for two of the courses, but also a pre-dinner cocktail. The food was exquisite, the pork chop with the kale and pickled onion main course was grand, and the paired wine could not have been better."
5,"Gosh Darn It! They had to be good. I was hoping, since they are so close to my home  and right next to where I shop for groceries most often (Fresh & Easy), that theyd be horrible. Then Id never have to go again... But, alas...too good to not go back, thats for sure! Ive said it before, Ill say it again: if you dont like a lot of frosting, just wipe off the portion you dont want. Heck, if youre sitting next to me and my kids, theyll eat it for you!! I didnt think I was much of an frosting fan either so I wiped off most from the Chocolate Chip Caramel, only to find that the milk chocolate frosting covered with a caramel drizzle was UH-MAZING! Scraped that heap right back in my mouth where it belongs! Yum. Equally impressive it the dense, moist cake (as opposed to light and fluffy texture; these puppies are HEAVY). The White Chocolate Raspberry was chock-full of white chocolate chips and the frosting was not too sweet. It was the prettiest one as well, with white sprinkles and raspberry sauce drizzle. Thoroughly enjoyed the two other chocolate selections (Texas Milk Chocolate & Midnight Magic) as well--Yes! I had four, but only cut them in half so I could save the rest for (my husband) later. Bonus points for presentation (the box is adorable) and variety."
4,"3.5 stars Came here for HH on a Tuesday. Loved the ambience, sort of a beachy type feel. We ordered all the appetizers listed for HH, including the sliders, grilled cheese sandwich, wings (buffalo), and bruschetta. Food was decent, my favorite being the grilled cheese sandwich. A nice place to wind down with good company."
3,"First time eating Cambodian food. I am not sure what its supposed to taste like so its hard to say if this is what cambodian food is.... Small, quiet place. Entrance was non-initutive to us for some reason, we walked in the kitchen. Its the door on the left if anyone was curious.  On a Monday at lunch, we were the only people in there around noon.  I didnt know what to order but I like shrimp so I went for it. I went  for the Shrimp Ling rice combo. It comes with soup, rice and a pickled salad.  The dish comes on a nice square plate so it makes the food 50x fancier just because its on a square plate. Lots of shrimp in my plate ~ about 10ish and theyre large. The shrimp was grilled and it tasted good but I wouldnt call it amazingly good that I was in love. I ate it and I like it but I thought to myself What is Cambodian food because the flavors dont seem unique? It seems like they grilled it in some soy sauce, maybe sugar, added more salt and maybe one or two other spices."" FYI - Theres bunch of green onions in the shrimp, I think they add that more flavor. They arent chopped into small pieces, its like the whole stem but I ate everything. I always eat everything - I dont waste my food (its almost like a sin not to finish your food unless you take it home... so nevermind). The pickled salad was refreshing. I like the soup, it was lukewarm and it reminded me of a Chinese wintermelon homecooked soup. Its like a mixed of Chinese style chicken broth with Vietnamese beef broth without the saltiness and msg. Adding the green onions to the soup definitely makes it 50x better as well - WOOHOO.  My dish was $8 - pretty good price. Thumbs up to that! Overall, would I go back? Eh - I dont know. I need to try other Cambodian places or maybe I should just have googled about it...maybe Vietnamese food is better? Apparently, the countries are located near each other so its similar to Vietnamese food."
4,"The Parlor is one of my go to favorites when Im craving pizza, going on a first date or have friends and family in town.  I always have a serious conflict between the margarita pizza v. the pesto pizza. They are both sooo good. Lately Ive been going for the margarita with a side of marinara side. Usually pair it with caesar salad."
2,"I know... I know... its Phoenix but I expected something far better.  Perhaps my mistake.  Located in what looks like an old fast food location this is a no frills, no cart, and no nonsense dim sum experience.  Dont think I will be going back (for many reasons) but if you are craving some bao or need a dumpling fix this place will do... just dont expect much."
4,"OK, Im somewhat between 3 stars and 4 stars on this.  I really want to like this restaurant a lot so maybe I will have to return again and try another dish. Positives: Price!!!!  Wow, the prices are amazing.  I got the hand pulled spicy noodle dish ($4.00), my boyfriend got the hand pulled pork noodles ($5.95) and we shared the pork dumplings ($4.95). The dishes provided rather generous portions (we ended up taking half of our meals to go).   The dumplings were quite tasty (approx 8 large dumplings) I got the passion fruit smoothie with boba which was quite good (I love bubble tea so much and this place is pretty legit). The restaurant was really clean and the window to watch the noodles being made was really interesting and ingenious! Negatives: My noodle dish just really didnt have a whole lot of flavor and was not even remotely spicy for being titled spicy noodles.   All of the food was really rather greasy.  The sauce for the noodles was pretty much pure oil and the dumplings/sauce were pretty oily too (but still tasty).  I was just hoping for a bit of a cleaner feeling meal instead of heavy greasy food.  Maybe if I try one of the soup dishes next time I will have better luck!   The experience was overall a good one and I would like to try this place again, I was just a bit disappointed with the grease content of the foods which gave me a bit of stomach ache.  Regardless, this place is worth a shot!"
3,"I hate the heat. HATE. Yet I am doomed to reside in this heat haven so when my best friend raved about a place where you can sit outside in Arizona and not feel the heat I had to check it out. By the time I ventured downtown to glance at this place Phoenix was experiencing a cool down so the patio was very comfortable without the fans and misters.  Our waitress was great and even chatted about our night and my favorite bar, SideBar. We got the L.B. favorite lavosh and I okayed the bacon even though it didnt sound too appetizing. It wasnt. I ordered some chicken sandwich that was on a french roll. The salad on the side was better than the sandwich. My friend ordered the classic turkey which was large but average. BUT I think ordering the classic sandwich was a boring mistake of its own. The fries that came with the turkey were greasy and when I ordered a amber ale and some guy brought a pale ale. I like pale ale so it wasnt too bad but it made me yearn for the amber. Yes, or course I ordered the amber next. The waitress told us that the island bar was opening the next day but there were still ladders and paint cans lying around. I failed to notice until my friend mentioned it. The only really cool thing about this place is that it is in a historic building with strange bathrooms. Other than that I would skip it."
2,New and big yes... but not my favorite spring training park. 5 stars for being big and roomy and also lots of grass in the outfield 2 stars for being almost like a major league park. Feels like you are attending a MLB regular season game. They lost out on the small spring training feel and intimacy. 0 stars for being the only cactus league park I visited this spring not allowing you to bring in food like candy or peanuts or sunflower seeds. You realize why when you see the pricey beer and food vendors inside.
5,"Baiz Market is a ""Mediterranean"" type restaurant, or ""Arabic"" type food. Well, you could get confused and call it that. The fact of the matter is though, that this place has a very unique touch. This restaurant is a staple not only for groceries, but also its food. The owner is persian, so you can tell where the tastes are coming from. Its somewhat hidden in the heart of Phoenix, but thats ok, once you are there you will be glad you found it. This place is unique because they make their own bread! Are you kidding me? I only recently found out about this place like 3 years ago, and Ive been living in Phoenix for 20 years. The chicken and beef shawarma have a special, authentic taste because of the fresh bread. One of the best parts about the shawarma is not only its amazing taste, but the pricing is very fair as well. I dont think I can stress this enough, but the fresh bread just sets this place apart from all the impostors in the Phoenix metro area. Why havent the other restaurants caught on? I know of maybe one persian restaurant that makes their own bread, but their pricing makes them a different story (Im talking about The Persian Room in Scottsdale). I just dont understand how other restaurants can serve the bread that comes in plastic bags from a manufacturer hundreds of miles away. Good bread and Arabic bread are all good forms of pita that have great shelf life due to the ridiculous amounts of preservatives, but they just dont taste fresh. If you like the bread, head to the back of the store and there is a shelf of freshly baked pita bread, its baked throughout the day, I think. I can tell because sometimes my bread is still warm and the bag has a little condensation. Beware though, the bread gets hard and crunchy after a few days, so you really need to use it quickly. This isnt bad, its just I think they choose not to add preservatives to ensure the freshness of the pita. I usually just get the chicken or beef shawarma, but I decided Id get a kabob plate one day because I also wanted hummus. The beef kabob plate came with hummus, bread, 2 skewers of beef kabob, and some pickles and onions. Wow. The beef kabobs were cooked perfectly, and were EXTREMELY tender. It was a tad bit on the lemony side, but I suppose that was necessary to make it so tender. Perhaps some of the best persian kabobs I have ever had. The hummus was definitely good as well, I cant stand restaurants that crack open a can of premade hummus. This restaurant certainly did not disappoint with the hummus. I know friends in Tucson that make stops specifically at this place for shawarma, and rightly so. If youre weary of persian food, just check this place out. Its not expensive at all, food for two is like $15. The wide variety of ethnic foods is also interesting."
5,We have been back several times since my initial review and the service and food have been consistently excellent for both lunch and dinner. Love their green chiles!!!
5,"If its good enough for Britney, its good enough for me.  Which I guess isnt saying much these days...  But trashy ole Brit knew what she was doing when she booked a room at Sanctuary.   This resort truely is a Sanctuary--the pool, complete with negative edge, in-water matching rafts for guests, and a top notch waitstaff was my favorite spot.  Had a gotten a chance to experience the spa, which Ive heard is one of the best in town, I may have taken up residence there. I stayed here as a reward for work with a bunch of girls--we had a suite--a sweet suit eactually, complete with 3 bedrooms, kitchen living room, etc.  We even had a cute bellboy who watched parts of the NBA finals with us.  Now thats service.   Plush robes, a balcony with a perfect mountain view, and egyptian cotton sheets.  Loveitloveit. At night we went to Elements which is the very up-scale restaurant and bar at the resort.  It deserves its own review so Ill write a seperate one, but know that its exceptional and the view is amazing.  A great date spot for even those who arent spending the night at the hotel."
5,"Great activity for kids. Its clean, spacious and safe."
3,"Okay, its a nice place but Im not sure I would drive out of my way to go here. I was in town on business staying nearby and thought Id give them a try. The food was good, but not great. The shredded beef taco was typical and the shredded pork burrito tasted more like beef. The red chili sauce had an okay flavor but the heat level seemed to simply over power everything (and I like hot). The restaurant is very nice inside, very upscale. I guess if you wanted to spend alot for a Mexican dinner in a very nice setting this would be the place. Service was so so, maybe it was because I was a party of one. Whatever the reason, it wasnt a happening thing. Hey, at least the salsa was tasty."
3,I didnt try any food hear but this place seems like it has a split personality. Tons of tvs showing sports so sports bar. At the same time theres a dj blasting club music. There werent that many people dancing. We went here because the place next door had a huge line. One plus is that theres a second bar near the patio that we stuck by. This place to me was...meh.
5,"Dont judge a book by its cover.  The outside doesnt look so great, but you go inside and its gorgeous.  The food is some of the best food Ive ever eaten.  Their sugar cane chicken appetizer is fantastic!! The pad thai, chiang mai noodles, pad kra po, pad lard na, etc.  This place is so flavorful with fresh veggies and fresh herbs.  And dont get me started on their fried honey banana dessert.  The best dessert Ive ever had!  Check this place out you will not be disappointed."
1,"Decided to give Tempe Marketplace another try after reading recent reviews (hoping that they had improved). I had to ask myself if we were visiting the same place. The traffic and parking situation are still horrible and the loudspeakers in the parking lot are unacceptable. The JC Pennys and Targets are crippled versions of their regular stores at other malls. The stores here all open too late (11am, REALLY???) to be useful in our uber hot summers (except for a Targets that opens at 8am).  Even though I am a Tempe resident, I will continue to choose the Riverview shopping area on Dobson over this mish-mashed monstrosity."
4,"Ive been to China Magic Noodle many times over the years; its one of my husbands favorite places to eat. The employees are friendly and prompt to provide service. I always get #34 (Beef, Noodles, w/XO sauce) or the #27 (Seafood Noodle Soup) and love both. The noodles plates are big; unless you are a big eater, expect to take some home. The mango smoothie w/boba is also delicious; you can taste the fruit and know its fresh. I agree w/some of the other reviewers regarding the smell - this place definitely has a ""smell"" to it, who knows what it is - but its not a disgusting/offensive smell. Overall the place is clean, the service is good, and the food is great!"
4,"Run by the Mormons, they keep it really well stocked and organized. I got a couple of cool chairs there, a pair of fake leather cowboy boots, 3 belted pencil skirts, 4 or 5 pairs of chunky 80s earrings, a mans plaid shirt that fits me perfectly, countless other things. It is a thrift store, so there are the usual things that would take away from the experience, but the prices are reasonable and not fixed by item, like Goodwill. Ive seen some really nice living room couches, sets, even, but never had a need. At one point, they had 40 or 50 framed prints of the same 5 paintings, one is a Van Gogh floral still life with a green background. Id never seen it, my mom picked one up, though.  I am a masochist, so I love to peruse the ""As-Is"" and the yard where they keep a lot of bigger, crappier stuff."
5,"Ive eaten here twice, and both times enjoyed myself immensely.   First, note that this is the smaller location; the one in Mesa has more tables and space. This one is closer to me, so this is the one I go to, but if you are looking to have a large group, you may wish to go to the Mesa location.    That said, I really like this one. The mood is very raw, because of the small size, even at a table you can see the cooks behind the bar, hear the clatter and clang of the kitchen. That said, you can still have conversations here without issue; you just have a bit of background noise.    The food, though...the food is spectacular. Seriously, look at that menu, look at those pictures. The first time I was there I had the chicken tikka masala pasty. Not as good chicken tikka as a straight up Indian restaurant, of course, but still phenomenal, and the pasty just made it that much better. I also snagged the bananoffee pie. It could easily provide dessert for two people; I ate the whole thing. It was just that good. Not too sweet, very banana-y...    Eat here. Its really that simple.     Also, as a tip, theres a parking lot round the back that is usually not full, unlike the one on the front. And, though the address is off of University Drive, the front is really facing Hardy. Threw me a bit the first time I was looking for it."
5,"This is place is a weekly trip for us as my girlfriend loves the salmon and martinis they serve here. We have been frequenting this place ever since we moved to the area versus the rare trips we would take for the awesome cream cheese chocolate cake made by Caroline or the lunch Caesar chicken sandwich. Here are my ratings of each dining point I consider when going here: Service: 5/5 Fast and very helpful, Even the chef will dig up custom stuff and cares what people think of the new entrees. Ambiance: 4/5 The place used to be a home so its a little cramped but nice nonetheless. Not as comfy as some others like Ticoz but we like it. As it is small in seating ranges you cant get too loud so keep the rowdy folks to the Applebees locales. Drinks: Ginger ale and the kiltlifter is nice as well as the blackwidow and black / blue martinis. recommended Food: Fish 5/5: My girls favorites are the halibut,swordfish,miso salmon with basmati rice, she also loves the spinach and asparagus. Sandwiches: 5/5 for roast chicken with green chili, side of coleslaw or balsamic salad 4/5 chicken caesar is good but sometimes is hit and miss meatloaf: 5/5 best I have ever had, it is a beauty. Tacos: 4/5 One time I had pork tacos they were the best ones I had tasted, the next time they were ok, then the last time they were great, not sure why but still recommended. Cream cheese cake: 5/5 Made from local baker who used to do deserts for Circa 1900 but now does it for them and Urban Bean to name a few. Steak,chicken, pork: 3/5 I have tried each and every one here and while you wont be disappointed there isnt a wow factor like the meatloaf. The sauces seem to not match or compliment the specific meat in my opinion. I would love a bordelaise sauce or onions and mushrooms with the filet for example. Appetizers: ?/? I am not a fan of  the bruschetta but havent tried the rest. I have heard the crab cakes are awesome but have yet to compare them to Fezs awesome versions. Pricing is on par with Sophies but less than Christophers and more that Ticoz. I am fine with it as the food I order is totally worth it."
2,"I finally got the chance to visit Lola on my way home from a poetry reading at the Phoenix Art Museum Last night..(Side note: If you get the chance to see Aaron Johnson read, do so.) I somehow feel the need to appologize for the lack of stars to all of you who seem to love this place. I would certainly be willing to give it another try but I was not impressed. First the music is loud, and therefore everyone talking in the place turns up the volume and as my girlfriend and I were seated across from each other at the communal table we could barely reach to share the food let alone hear each other. Why are the tables so big if the food is so small? Maybe I am a bit of a glutton, but for 8 dollars I essentially ate a mushroom for dinner...Dont get me wrong it was tasty, and I understand Tapas are appetizers, but 8 dollars? I was disapointed. I used to go to Firefly in Vegas and it was cheaper and tastier. We just wanted to try this place and move on someplace quieter, but I was really looking forward to it...We decided not to have drinks and simply share one thing so we could get to said quieter place before it got too late...I think because we ordered so little, the waitress considered us a waste as far as her tips were concerned and therefore seemed not so friendly...and those little bitty glasses of water they bring...I drank immediately and it was never refilled.  I was overall not impressed by anything except a patrons sweet ass Salvador Dali Mustache. I can see the charm there and I probably will give it another shot but based on this trip 2 stars is fairer than fair."
1,"Closed... GONE UNDER, OUTTA HERE.. See ya later, bye bye.."
4,"Sub Factory is one of the better sub shops in Tempe - They have been around forever and have a reputation of using the highest quality, freshest ingredients. They may need to give this location a ""make-over"" soon though... its getting a little tired. (FYI - their secret weapon is their bread)"
5,"Great views, great food, great service and great atmosphere!  We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner here and couldnt believe the neighborhood special - 3 courses for $35! The split pea soup was amazing as well as the bing cherry cheesecake...yum!"
4,"I dig this place, I really do, but the portions are small. They do make up for it  by packing a straight kick to your man or woman pleaser with zesty flavors. I didnt dig the guacamole-too much salt, but loved, loved, loved the chips that came with it. The place is quite spacious and modern with featured art on the walls. I went for dinner so the lighting was minimal giving the place a sexy, urban feel to it. The kind of lighting that makes you wonder if the people are really this good looking? Or is the lighting really just this good???  The carne asada beef tacos were divine. Really moist and succulent with just enough spice to make your taste buds tingle. Two is hardly enough, so we also tried the fish tacos and well, I could smell the fishiness from across the table which makes me a little uncomfortable. I did try it, though and it was okay. Not too fond of anything that tastes or smells too fishy. Reminds me of unsanitized, dirty, dirty girls. (Haha, had to throw in a visual for you all!) My favorite plate was the ensalada cortada. I loved all the ingredients mixed in together, especially the corn nuts. Genius idea!  For drinks, I had the la sangria. Fruity, refreshing, and light tasting. It was really good, but I passed it on to my date in hopes of taking advantage of him later on. Almost worked, but when we got to the normally secluded rooftop @ the Clarendon hotel, they were hosting a social gathering of some sort with lots of people. Damn. Shouldve drank my sangria. Oh well...another day since I will most definitely be back for some more Gallo Blanco. I cant wait to try their breakfast menu!"
5,"This is by far the best farmers market Ive been to in the Valley.  Still small by comparison to LA and the Bay Area but is off to a great start with lots of potential and space to grow into. McClendon has a great spread of high quality mainly organic produce and is constantly restocking so its ok if you dont get there first thing.  It was exciting to see beautiful Tuscan kale and broccoli rabe at prices lower than Sprouts.  Meyer lemons and blood oranges were also available. Phoenicians outstanding loaves were only $3. Youre welcome to sample - we particularly liked the Olive Walnut and Dark Chocolate Cherry. We enjoyed Digestifs Frittata ($4) made with thin layers of potato, eggs, pork belly and spinach.  Other combinations available were Dandelion with Goat Cheese and Mushrooms with Garlic Confit. Executive Chef Payton Curry is also there to demonstrate pulling fresh mozzarella which is served with a variety of sauces and toppings, It was fun walking around this bustling market sampling food, like tamales, which we intend to come back for next week.  If I can get myself out of bed at a decent hour on Sat, Ill be here for sure every week until the season ends in May."
5,"I am sad that Luckys is so far from where we live.  I worked near Luckys last year and just happened to walk in for lunch.  My lunch was so good I took a huge meat lovers pie home, which was so good my husband proposed all over again! The employees were so friendly and explained that their pizza might take a little longer than normal, but they want to make sure its right.  I loved everything about my visit there, and was able to stop in a couple more times throughout the year.  Its about an hour drive from where I live, but the more I think about it, I think were going to have to go get some more Luckys pizza.  Great neighborhood pizza place!"
3,"Thought Saturday night would be busy at 6:00 PM, but to our surprise it was just getting started. We dont like to go there too often because it seems that a lot of older folks go there, not that Im a ""spring chicken"". The waiter was efficient, he never told us his name but memorized our order. He made sure we had our drink glasses filled at all times. When he brought out the bread, it was only three pieces of different types: roll, carrot bread and another type. We had to ask for another order. My daughter had the Chicken Pot Pie which had chunks of chicken but the sad part, the crust was only on the top, which was golden brown. To her it was OKAY. My wife had the petite sirloin steak which came with a salad and asparagus. She ordered it medium rare and it was a little too pink, but still eatable. My order was the Lamb Shank on top of mashed potatoes and asparagus. Love asparagus!! The lamb was okay and portion was just right. The sauce that was poured over the lamb was like beef stew gravy with carrots and celery. The sauce was a bit salty for me but bearable. If you looked at the lamb shank you would mistaken it for a turkey drumstick."
3,"I will preface this by saying that I went here a couple years ago for lunch and thought it was very good, which gave it an extra star over my true opinion of my dinner there last night. The BF and I went here before seeing Louis CK for our anniversary. We were seated right away, so that was nice, but it was like 5:45 so that isnt too shocking. We sat outside, which was nice and had pretty christmas lights on all of the trees. The waiter comes by after about 5 minutes and asks us for drinks or apps and we ordered the burrata as an app. The menu said it was topped with a balsamic glaze, which sounded wonderful. We were also ready to order our pizza but the waiter disappeared immediately after taking our app order. So we wait. and wait. and wait. And I swear it felt like it was a half hour, but it was probably more like 10-15 minutes later (we were super hungry) the waiter came back to take our pizza order. We ordered the La Noce and he left. Well.... we waited some more. Finally got our burrata and it was a mess. Two giant globs of cheese with the lightest drizzle of balsamic dressing (not vinegar, because there is no way this weak stuff was straight up vinegar) surrounded by bread and prosciutto. It was large, so Ill give them that.... but too large in my opinion, because there isnt enough bread for the toppings. The burrata was good, creamy.... but it didnt taste like balsamic at all, which was the most appealing part of the app. The prosciutto was alright... it didnt have a ton of flavor, but it was fine. The bread had a burnt flavor... not my fave. Then we wait about 20 minutes.... waiter did not check on us.... Finally get the pizza. The pizza was good. That was the redeeming item of the night. It had arugula, walnut, ricotta, and mozz. It was a tasty combination.  Now, the whole time we were there, there was a table of about 6-8 extremely loud, drunk, possibly old sorority girls sitting near us. All we could hear is their conversation, so much so, that we knew one girl was named rochelle and one was Tina and one had been divorced for 4 years and they had a friend named Lori who was just sooo crazy among many other details that we should not have gathered from sitting in their proximity, which obviously puts a damper on the experience. The waiter was so occupied with them, that we felt forgotten about all night. He was not attentive, he did not ask how things were, and he disappeared for long periods of time to go do who knows what for this other table (they had a bunch of ridiculous requests like splitting the bill 6-8 ways when the menu says they dont do that... hmmm). We sat down at 5:45 and barely got out of there around 7 to make it to our show (we were walking). So the experience wasnt a good one, BUT I would be willing to try it again, as I did have a very nice lunch there a few years ago."
3,Decent food at a good price. Bargain lunch specials in a good atmosphere.
4,this is not in the mall dq a real road side flash back
4,"Theres something deliciously seventeen about drinking in ""The Alley.""  Of course, real seventeen year olds cant get in.  This place is legit, but the vibe is very Lloyd Dobler in a gas station parking lot asking a bunch of punk kids why he just cant win with women.  (Dont worry Lloyd none of us really have that figured out and most of us who seem to be doing it successfully are really just faking it.) The crowd here varies but I have always felt welcome.  Drinks are ok.  Sometimes theyre great but it depends on whos tending bar.  The good thing is theyre fairly cheap.  As a music venue I give it  high five.  Its dirty and dark with a one foot high stage thats obviously meant for performance but not so far removed as to make you feel like youre not connected to whats going on.  The sound is ok.  It depends on the show really but Ive always had a good time and that counts for a lot. I like the pictures on the ceiling. Theyre fun to try to decipher when youre setting yourself on spin cycle.  The pool tables are usually full so I cant really vouch for them other than to say that theyre popular.  All in all, its a decent place to pummel yourself in the face with your beverage of choice."
4,"Very good noodle shop.  I got referred here on my second day in town by the folks at Fujiya.  They were right.  I went for lunch and I almost could have missed it, tucked away in a little corner in a shopping plaza.  But the outside appearance belied the cute interior.  I am waiting for it to get cold out (or even mildly less than scorching) so I can go in for some Ramen!!  Real Ramen - nothing like it.  This trip I had Tempura and some cold noodles. - Good stuff."
3,"The first thing I respect about Rula Bula is its ability to attract customers while keeping a low profile. No flashing lights, no 400 pound bouncers with angry stares, and no promotional cards being shoved in my face from down the street. I walked in and liked what I saw. It has an old school feel to it. There was a live band doing some Lady Gaga covers, and it sounded like karaoke. I wasnt impressed, so I ordered my Jameson (reasonably priced) and walked out to the patio. It was a good patio, with a DJ in the corner. It had a different feel to it, and I appreciate how laid back it was. But it felt like something was missing. I waltzed back inside, admired a much better cover (of Micheal Jackson) and realized the one thing I couldnt find here.  FUN. To a west-sider like myself, Tempe is the Mecca of mischief, a place where I can have one too many and stumble back home with a story to tell. There was a dance floor, but no one was dancing. There were tons of people, but every group kept to themselves. Even though I dont go to bars to meet women, there was a suspicious lack of pretty ones in here. Its like everyone who was too old or uncool to go elsewhere came to have a Guinness in peace. I came here expecting a fun bar that wasnt a full-blown club, and instead of getting a happy medium I ended up with a boring dive. Dont get me wrong, I fucking LOVE dive bars, but I dont go to Mill Ave for them. Rula is a good place with good history. I cant hate on it. I love the interior, and I could see myself coming back during the day. Its just not worth going out of my way on a Saturday night."
4,"This is the only music store on my side of town and since I never can buy online early enough, is where I usually buy my reeds. The customer service is great and they appear to have a huge selection of almost everything a music student should need."
2,"the promise of homemade turkey and roast beef drew me in, much to my dismay its shredded. As Ramsey would say like a dogs dinner!. I got the bobby with roast beef, so i could taste both. The bread was good, the stuffing was cold. The meat was chokingly dry. Dry dry. Sawdust tasting. Im sure the other non shredded meats are great on that bread, this might as well had just been the stuffing and cranberries on the bread. Plus, the manager was bragging about how he just stands around and does nothing but micro manage. Donkeys! Lol. Make that guy clean the bathrooms!"
5,"This is a family owned local restaurant at its best. If you like to explore and support locally owned businesses, you should definitely give this one a try. They have a big menu and I have tried breakfast and lunch and both were excellent, but the breakfast is particularly good. I love the breakfast burrito. (to the reviewer that complained about the greasy chorizo...hello, it is chorizo, chorizo is sausage). I would go out of my way to stop and eat here whenever in the general area."
4,"Great atmosphere with interesting lights (look like white jellyfish). Got a Chicken piccata which was delicious. TVs were conveniently placed so we were able to watch the World Series Games. Overall, a fun place to catch up with friends."
4,"Ok its a chain, so theres that...  But Im like Broman and we luv us a good sammich!   And Capriottis didnt disappoint there. I went at an odd time and had the place to myself, it was quite clean and instead of just hanging out BSing the people were busy taking care of the place. So the menu - short and sweet, thats how I like it.  Unlike a place like the friggin Cheezecake Crapory with its 80,000 menu items, none of them done well, Capriottis keeps it under control and turns out a tasty sammy.   I had the turkey sub with spicy peppers, mmm mmmm.  I love the fresh roasted turkey like that, and the ""just like grandma made"" pickles.  Well not like either of my grandmas made, but someones grandma...  The veggies passed the fresh & crispy test with flying colors and the sub roll was perfectly soft and chewy. Ya its slightly on the higher end fast sandwich price range, but its quality and pretty filling.  I made 2 meals out of the 9"", with the meal deal right around $10.   I have a Groupon for the place and cant wait to take my good friend and get him hooked.  Next victim on my list:  the Bobbie!!"
1,"Cold, under done chips. If a Mexican food restaurant can not get this staple right how can I expect them to get much more right.  I arrived for a party that my autocross group was having. Every table had chips and salsa on it. Sombreros were used as the server platters. Senor I dont think this even meets health code.  Dinner was served Buffet Style, one of the dishes was called ""fandito."" I cant think of a less inspired dish. It was simple pasta with some Mexican flavors thrown it, a dish that your mother would make if she had leftovers from Mexican Italian nights.  I like really like Mexican food, however I left this place hungry as I did not even want to try any of the dishes other than the salad."
2,"An Ode to Walmart: Its Walmart A senior citizen handing out carts at the door.  My cart doesnt roll straight.  Im not surprised.  There are no baskets, just carts.  Is that a hint? Its Walmart. More babies than a daycare.  More seniors than a senior center.  And tattoos for everyone. Its Walmart. Cardboard kingdoms of snacks, a tower of cheese balls bigger than you head for $5.98 each, a wall of ramen labeled ""Cup-O-Soup,"" and a kid putting cheese balls bigger than your head into his familys cart. Its Walmart. Fifty cent clearance plastic margarita glasses.  A crate of $5 DVDs bigger than my bathtub.  The PA announces ""All loaders, code 60.  All loaders, code 60."" Its Walmart. A pharmacy, vision center, credit union, grocery store, hair dresser, automotive section, toy store, bike shop, Home Depot, and Office Depot all under one roof.  I think I got lost twice. Its Walmart. Profits measured one penny at a time.  Is Walmart a savior for the poor or does Walmart enable poverty?  Economist cant decide.  Does Walmart help the environment by working with vendors to reduce and remove packaging, and engaging in some environmental friendly projects.  Environmentalists have decided. Its Walmart. Self-checkout with a weight sensor to keep you honest.  Theyve never checked my receipt at the exit.  Is it because Im white? Its Walmart. Patrons leave their carts at the bus stop.  Where did that hour of my life go?"
2,"The kids and I LOVE Starbucks but this one leaves a lot to be desired.. We have been here a hand full of time and each time I keep asking myself why do I go back to this one?  The service there is almost rude. They seem as if they are annoyed to be busy. They never seem to be happy to service you. Drinks take forever to make, even though they arent as busy as other ones are. We wont even go into the fact that my order has been messed up the last 2 times. The main issue I have is the fact that 3 out of 5 times when sitting and relaxing with a snack, someone has to sweep the floor near me. Really? While I am sitting there? There are much better Starbucks and I think I am going to try some others locally. 12/06 - The kids and I went in today for our ""snack"" wanted to say things were better today. I am not going to change my rating until after my next visit ;)"
1,just say no. this place is truly awful.  too bad its taking up valuable space on monroe.
5,"Gosh-Awful-Gooey Banana Split: fresh banana split lengthwise, Turkish coffee ice cream blanketed with caramel sauce, red raspberry sorbet smothered in marshmallow sauce with delicious whip and a juicy maraschino cherry atop. Heaven!!"
5,"I went there last night with bf to celebrate our anniversary. After pre-yelp, we knew what to expect as to prices, so it wasnt so much of a shocker. To the food, we concur with almost everyone here. It was impeccable! We ordered the ice tower for 2 and thought that it was very well presented. Ours came with 3 appetizers (raw oysters, crab claws and dungeness crab) so it wasnt too high. They are all fresh. Growing up I used to go to the beach quite often just to have fresh crabs, so I know what those taste like. And for 6 years living in the desert, Mastros is the first and only one in AZ to deliver that.   For main course, I got Ivory Salmon ""Oreganata"", bf got Swordfish blackened. I am quite picky when it comes to fish, and bf isnt exactly a fish person, but both of our dishes ""surpassed expectation."" I couldnt say much about swordfish except it was fresh. We had the same dish 2 weeks before at somewhere else, it was nowhere near as sweet and fresh as the one at Mastros. It was my first having Ivory Salmon, it was sweeter, and white (hence the name) than normal salmon we get around here. Mine was good size portion, firm to the touch, but melted in the mouth. The flavor was subtle enough to enjoy by itself, or you can add one of the sauces provided. One of my favorite sauces of the night I think was made of minced tomatoes and olives, came with the main course. Sides were Lobster Mash and Snap peas. I didnt really care for snap peas as I can make them at home. But lobster mash is a MUST for those who go there. Im not sure how they prepared it, but it felt like mash potatoes made with lobster bisque (instead of water and milk) and added lobster chunks. It was much more flavorful and creamy than a normal mash potatoes. It was big enough to share and take home. One thing though, it hardened up after sitting out for awhile, so Im not sure if microwave could make it all fluffy again after 1 night in the fridge. Drinks there are amazing, from the presentation, to the taste, and definitely the amount of alcohol in each drink. We decided to go with cocktail drinks rather than wines because of other yelpers reviews. Total worth it!!! The service was amazing. We had Robert. We pretty much asked him for recommendations for everything, yet he was nice about it and very knowledgeable. Next time we go back, I would definitely ask for him again. We didnt order dessert since they gave us a dark-chocolate ""Happy Anniversary"" cake with the letters written, also, in chocolate. The overall experience was 4 3/4, just because it was a bit difficult talking to each other. The acoustic of the room wasnt very good and it got loud. Didnt see much of cougar/manther scene as we were in the dining room. And maybe it was during weekdays, we saw lots of ""expense account"" people though"
3,"Tilted Kilt is alright. I have been here a few times and what stands out in my mind is nice decor with many tvs, good beer selection, but crappy service and food. I am really big on service, coming from the industry for over 7 years, so when I get bad service, I get in a bad mood. The girls are pretty lucky they are hot because I dont think it would fly otherwise. The fish n chips I had were not good, obviously just poured from a bag, which is disappointing. I felt the server was really flaky and inattentive, she was sitting with a group of guys pretty much the whole time, while I was waiting for my napkins, then my malt vinegar, ugh. Then she came to tell us she was going on a smoke break and I dont think I saw her after that. All in all, I can appreciate a cute girl in sexy kilts (I was actually hired to work here when they first opened) and I love me some good beers and flat screens, but I will pass on the whole dining experience."
5,"My boyfriend and I went to Film Bar last night to see Iron Sky. Neither of us had been there before, and the decision was made quickly, so we had no idea what to expect. The bartender was incredibly nice, friendly, informative, and genuine. The prices for the bar were very reasonable, and I thought that $7 for tickets was MORE than reasonable. We were there more than an hour early, and it was so nice to just sit back on the low booths and chat. I gotta admit, I totally fell in love with this little place, and I cant wait to go back! My ONLY concern is that by the time our movie was done, there was a DJ playing music so loudly that you could hear it in the theater and you couldnt talk without shouting in the bar, so we had to go outside to converse with our friends. I would bet that the place doesnt have a DJ all the time, though."
5,"Absolutely fabulous espresso place! The owner and staff are gracious and friendly, but most importantly they get coffee! I didnt have to explain how to make an espresso macchiato -- they just made it perfectly! Ill be here every time I visit Chandler!"
5,"The place is a hole in the wall right behind the PHX car rental center. Arrived at dinner time, and had the best Mexican food! I had the #5 Machaca Plate w/rice, beans, & one of their homemade tortillas burrito style. It was just amazing, and so cheap ($5.65). The only issue I have with this place is that its very well used, and looks very dirty, I did find it a bit sticky. Maybe this is a better place for pickup.  If you want a clean restaurant, their North restaurant on Cactus Road restaurant is much cleaner."
5,"This Chipotle Rocks!   Today, I express my joy In the haiku form! Perfect fast food joint; Fresh, delicious, quick and kind. The price is right, too! Burritos galore; In a tortilla or bowl. But wait, there is more! Three steak tacos, please! Or grilled veggie fajitas? Oh sweet perfection. A simple menu, Yet so many decisions. How can you go wrong? Answer:  You cannot!   Order now, you wont regret, This Chipotle Rocks!"
5,"For some reason these self serve frozen yogurt places have popped up all over the valley and they are all very similar. What I like about this place are the choices. I usually dont have any issues, Im a mint chocolate chip man, and thats typically what I order. My girlfriend on the other hand likes to mix it up and try new flavors and toppings. This place has the largest selection of flavors and toppings of any of the self served frozen yogurt places weve been too. For those of you who are calorie conscience, as I am, they post the nutrition facts right buy the flavor so you know exactly what youre getting."
5,"Im on a community social action committee and have spent the last year planning a community-wide service day. We were each responsible to lead a team of volunteers in a different community service project and per my passion I chose the Humane Society. We arrived on Sunday afternoon with a group of 12 people at the Campus for Compassion on Dobbins Rd. Kathy - the head of volunteer services - met with us and gave us a thorough introduction. She included the history of the AZ humane society and the process and procedures by which they take-in and shelter animals. She really focused on promoting spaying and neutering pets and cited some very impressive statistics. Did you know that over 7 years un-neutered  cats can breed to reach 420,000 in numbers??!!!! and dogs 67,000??!!! thats CRAZY and so compelling.  Kathy proceeded by giving us a very educational tour of the facilities... we saw dogs, horses, cats and bunnies. It was very eye-opening. First off it shattered any stigma you have about a shelter. The animal accommodations are so impressive!! The dogs have BIG size kennels with indoor and outdoor spaces that are really spacious. I was nervous to go in and see the dogs in kennels but I really wasnt as heartbroken as I thought Id be bc they really had nice size spaces.  There are sprawling lawns in the back where animals can run and play which even include a public dog park! There are also private puppy rooms.  The cats have big crates as well and even private bedrooms where they can hang out in groups and the facilities were squeaky clean w/o any odors.  The volunteers were so nice, kind and devoted to the animals. We got to feed horses, play with cats and bunnies and put together leashes for dogs. The most encouraging thing though was that the place was busy on a sunday! buzzing with people wanting to adopt pets and several cats were actually adopted during the 2 hours we were there. It was a wonderful and meaningful experience and I encourage anyone who is looking for a pet to adopt from the Humane Society and to look into volunteering with them"
4,"Outstanding service and food , drinks are not bad. Service cant be beat."
3,Had breakfast this morning while waiting on getting my windows on my car tinted. I had the build your own omelete. I got it with chorizo bell peppers and cheddar cheese. It was pretty good and the portion size was big for the price. They had fresh squeezed orange juice too. Not the best breakfast Ive had but it was good.
4,"We had a fun, early dinner on the patio here at BoomBozz.  The advertised happy hour specials appeared to be a very good value; my fave was the soft pretzels & cheese.  I also had the wedge salad and it was excellent - they dont skimp on the blue cheese!  My son had the pepperoni pizza and even his discriminating palate was very happy.  A crisp blonde draft (for me) and ice cream (for him) polished us off and we left full & happy."
4,"This is a great place to eat and hang out with friends.  I always get the pretzel appetizer and the angry chicken sandwich.  When I am eating them, I believe there is nothing better I could be eating at the time.  I crave those items.  I also enjoy the games there- buck hunter, pool and darts. I recommend this place!"
5,"Honestly the best part of this place is the unbelievable deal you can get on pet related products. Because they are one of the primary income sources for HALO Animal Rescue, people that have pets, tend to make donations. You can almost always find pet carriers for under $10. They have dog crates for training and you dont have to shell out a fortune for them. They have fish tanks that will allow you to let little Johnny get his feet wet in the world of pet care and the associated responsibilities without breaking the bank. If you are a person that shares your life with animals, you understand the rarity of these kinds of deals! Yes they have clothes, furniture, tchatchkies, etc., but the real deals are on the pet products. As a side note, HALO recently leased the MCCAC location at 5231 North 35th Avenue (It was the previous Maricopa County run cat adoption center). So if you are looking for a companion (cat or dog), check them out and support one of the fastest growing no-kill efforts in the US. http://www.halorescue.org/index.html"
4,This place made me feel comfortable about moving to Arizona.  I just moved from L.A. and was totally worried about not having access to Asian stuff.  Of course it is not comparable to L.A. but this place has all the essentials. *Vegetables = fresh *Meat = frozen *Fish = frozen *Dried food = plenty *Bread = they bring in baked goods from Olive Bakery in L.A. *Cooking supplies = half of the store is full of them
3,"This was really 3.5 stars and Im rounding down to 3 for a few reasons...on which I will now elaborate. District could be in any Sheraton, anywhere.  In fact, it is strikingly similar to Rum Fire, the trendy restaurant in the Sheraton Waikiki where I stayed for a few days this summer before my family arrived and we stayed moved to the family place.  The flooring, the red circular lounge area, the live music on Thursday nights...it was all the same.  Heck, even the menu was the same.  The difference was that in Waikiki there was a ""Hawaiian"" slant to everything and the live music was much, much better.  (And of course the beach front setting).  I get the impression that they are trying to market themselves as a ""downtown restaurant"" more than the ""place in the Sheraton""...but to be honest, it is your quintessential trendy hotel restaurant. The bartenders were really friendly.  The wine list for a ""wine bar"" is incredibly lacking.  Nothing interesting, nothing fun.  The pricing is on par with what I would expect from a hotel.  The space is modern and trendy, something that there isnt that much of in downtown.  I love the charm of a historic home, but I also love sleek and modern lines. We selected a few small plates, or appetizers, depending on which of their menus you are looking at.  The crab cakes were good, if nothing short of predictable, and the chips and dip were surprisingly unique.  A dill dip and a French onion dip provided a nice departure from the regular spinach artichoke.  Im not sure this is a place that I would come to for dinner, and it is definitely not a place I would come to for brunch.  (The brunch menu is a typical hotel menu, with typical hotel pricing).  I think that for me District will just remain a place for drinks and small bites.   Im not going to lose my mind over this place.  Its not that great, Id say its fairly generic.  But the staff was friendly and its within walking distance of my place.  Im sure I will be back for drinks."
5,"Great Frozen Yogurt. Helpful staff, clean enviroment."
5,"I have a serious Banana Republic problem. Rewind time to about three years ago when I bought my first dress from BR. I had just gotten my first full time ""real job"" after finishing college and I needed a wardrobe to match my new position. It is now three years later and I have probably close to twenty dresses from BR. The only issue I have is they leave me pretty darn broke, so when I heard BR had a factory store I was stoked! So last weekend I dragged my husband, sister and niece down to Anthem to check this place out. It was crowded, but the prices of the items definitely make up for it. That is, when you find something worth buying. The selection of items is a little weird, and you have to fight with many other women to get into the racks with the good stuff. But I managed to find two 100% cotton dresses that are both casual and work appropriate at the same time. Priced originally at $80 with a markdown to $40 on the rack, they also had a 25% off sale on these particular items that day. So I scored two dresses originally totaled for $160 for $60. Sounds like a good deal to me. I wish they had more colors, except that would have been bad for my credit card cause I am sure I would have ended up buying them all. My husband also scored two pairs of jeans, two cotton shirts, and three pairs of boxers for under $100.  I can see myself making the 50 minute drive down here at least four times a year to see what new stuff comes in. My dress collection is going to get larger this year, I can tell you that. Also, if you sign up online for the factory store you can get coupons for extra % off your total purchase. So your super discounted items just got even more discounted."
4,"Been here a few times now so its time for the review.  Walked up to the hostess on a Saturday night and she asked if we had reservations, I said ""no"" because I didnt think this place was like that but then spending some time here it kinda makes sense, or Sens. Haha. So one time ended up getting 6 (maybe a few more but the beers were going down pretty easy that night) different items.  Each one well thought out and fun to eat.  Yes, I said fun. One was cooked by us on a hot rock, and the others made us investigate each tasty bite. Yup, the portions are small, but theyre darn good vittles I tell ya.  Oh yeah, and they have a DJ so they get a few extra hipster points."
4,"I was contacted by the manger at this location cause of my bad review, I am really for proactive owners. I really need to go back to this location to give them another try since the first time I went there it was really good. I was given a gift card to wipe out what I paid for the last meal as kinda of do over. I will be back Anthony and I will let you know how my next visit is."
5,"This my favorite Chipotle ever!!! Its so consistent and good! No hormones in the meat makes this ""fast"" food an A+ for me!!! Yum!!!"
1,"I can overcome the hipster sneer and accept that I am an uncool blemish in a world full of cut-off corduroys and patterned leggings. What I cannot and will not get over is an unapologetic staff whose epic error led to me breaking 5 years of meatless eating because of an order mishap. I ordered the red pepper tomato quiche. After 20 minutes waiting for the quiche to warm in what appeared to be a 200 degree oven, I double checked to make sure my name was on the plate at the counter. When I dug in for the first bite, a wave of nausea and panic washed over my after realizing this was a piece of the bacon spinach quiche. I returned to the counter and explained that I had ordered the vegetarian quiche, and the chic who took my order asked the chic behind the counter which one she served, because she was sure she got it right. The chic in the kitchen said she put them out in the order she got them. Then they spent some time looking around in confusion and murmuring a bit,  meanwhile all the quiche had been sold. So the counter chic simply turned to me and send, ""well we dont have anymore of that one."" Thanks. I told her I was more upset about the fact that I had just put bacon in my mouth after 5 years of no meat than there being no more quiche. She did give me my money back, but no one apologized or offered me any recompense. Im over you being cooler than me, but Im not over you having no soul."
2,"Ive lived at Mark Taylor properties for about five or six years now and I have to say, they have declined greatly in the last few years.  When I first started living at my first MT property, the front office staff took the time to get to know you, knew you by name, kept abreast of any ongoing issues and were proactive about things.   Now, they really seem to be nothing more than shills for what Mark Taylor has become, reacting to issues only when implored to do so.  Rent constantly goes up, even for those of us that have shown property loyalty years over.  Additional ""fees"" are even being added on for services that you may or may not even use -- either way you have to pay.   The only reason that I didnt give them one star is because of the maintenance staff.  They are what the front office staff used to be.  Friendly, polite and very responsive to your problems.  They, in fact, have a pretty similar opinion of the ""front office"" folks as I do.  That is pretty telling."
2,"I went here a few months ago, well I guess when they first opened, whenever that was (the fall of 2010 maybe). Anyways I am a vegan so asked about their vegan options. They said that pretty much everything was made with lard (I didnt know that people really still used that) but they said that they had a vegan burrito. I was assured that there wasnt any kind of un-vegan ingredients (such as cheese) in it. I ordered the vegan burrito with much skepticism. Once I got home and got about half way through the burrito I got a big mouth full of CHEESE!!  I was so upset because I was assured that it was vegan and did not come with cheese. But even worse,  I think that they started putting cheese on the burrito and then realized that it was supposed to be the vegan burrito with no cheese and they just kind of picked what cheese they could off and left the cheese that they couldnt easily pick off on there. I am not positive thats what happened but im pretty sure. Anyways aside from the fact that they REALLY messed up my order, the burrito was just okay. It was really pretty greasy. My fiance on the other hand seems to enjoy this place, he gave it 4 stars. He said that it is a good place for greasy mexican, and on Wednesdays you can get a huge burrito for only 5 dollars."
4,"I stayed here for two nights the first week of April 2012.  Woot. Arizona weather really is the best.  Overall, it was a nice place to stay. Purdy too. I bought a deal on Hotwire and wasnt sure what hotel I was booking until I paid, and it turned out to be this resort.  Overall, very satisfied for the price I paid.  However, I do not think I would pay $200+ a night here.  At that point, I would say its not worth it. The entrance is gorgeous and nicely updated. Trendy, modern, yet warm. Love the lit deer heads.  I want them.  It feels like a high class resort when you first go through the entrance.  Once you head to the rooms though, it does seem like an older resort.  However, our room was nicely decorated and very clean so no complaints in that area. If you are missing your pets from home, be sure to ask for a pet fish during your stay! I asked for one, well, I had to ask twice because they forgot the first time... But soon I had a goldfish in my room which I named Basil.  (Due to me becoming inebriated on one too many cucumber basil martinis... Dont judge) As for the room/parking, its very easy to park extremely close to the entrance to the rooms which we liked.  It was easy to navigate in and out as the resort is fairly small.  The room itself, ours faced the parking area, which we didnt really care either way about.  It was close to the pool so that was good enough for us.  However, I will say the bed sucked.  When my husband turned, I too turned and bounced along with him.  They badly need to upgrade to better beds. While not uncomfortable per se, I dont enjoy feeling every teeny movement of my partners. They had nice toiletries- C.O Bigelow.  I enjoyed those little aspects. For an hour every evening they had free wine happy hour, which we did check out one of the evenings.  Hey, no one complains about Free Wine!!!  Nothing special, but it did the trick. Hotel Bar: Had some kick ass cocktails.  Plenty of strength and tasty concoctions. Biggest Bummer?  The pool area.  Dont get me wrong, its pretty. First appearances are good.  There is plenty of shade from large palms and such and theres an area for kiddies with sand.  However, there is not enough chairs for the amount of guests.  And the guests that are there put towels on all the chairs even if they arent around, which is not cool.  Suggestion to hotel:  Perhaps walk around every hour and remove towels if no ones been sitting there for awhile?  Its not fair for a select few to have a chair all day, while others are unable to lay by the pool at all.  And while there is plenty of shade, for me that was another downfall.  Almost too much shade.  It was hard to find areas to sun in compared to those covered by shade.  It made me majorly pissy.  Sun is why I came to AZ. Overall, a great place close to downtown Scottsdale and a walk away from the mall. Perfect for those who want to spend time near the action.  If you can get a good deal here, its worth the stay. Plus, they have a free shuttle if you want to go somewhere a few  miles from of the place.  (so you can drink and have a driver)"
1,"Not recommended if youre not white. For me, its the third time somebody threw out racial slurs at my group. I am beginning to think the place is for rednecks and the like. D&B bowling lanes are better."
1,My daughter and I went in for pedicures and gel sets... was incredibly surprised to hear the total was $120. even with a coupon!!! When I got home I noticed that my pedicure wasnt the best... I really dont mind paying top dollar for top dollar services but even with a coupon it wasnt worth it. Wont be back...
1,"I think chef Silvana Esparza first located the restaurant here on CALLE DIECISEIS (she renamed the street all by herself, apparently) to take advantage of cheap rent.  There was no way she was going to locate her Scottsdalish restaurant actually in Scottsdale.  So, people from the wealthier areas - and some First Friday urban hipsters whose parents foot their bills - make the trek down to CALLE DIECISEIS to partake in everything Barrio Cafe.  And they think its cool that they are going there, past the check cashing places, the people waiting at the bus stops and the ""rawness"" of this part of central Phoenix. And what is everything ""Barrio Cafe""???? Pretentious service. LOUD dining room. NO parking. Fusion food that is about 10 years past its prime. High prices. Lets talk a little about the last item on the list. Besides using vulgar language in her YouTube videos for pseudo social activism, Esparza seems to have forgotten her own humble upbringings.  Its ironic that the very people who live on and around CALLE DIECISEIS cannot afford to eat in her restaurant.  The Mexican immigrants and their sons and daughters who do the cooking, the cleaning, the landscaping and all that for Phoenix are not welcome at the Barrio Cafe.  I know that this is not a taco truck, but there is some overwhelming irony here that you locate your restaurant in a working class area and supposedly have sympathy for the plight of the downtrodden and the neighbors cant even eat  at your restaurant.  I guess thats capitalism.  Like that new car, by the way."
5,This location is great and there grooming service is good as well.
1,"I called The Town Dump to ask if I could come in this week and interview them for an English paper about a small local business, and the owner was just incredibly rude. She didnt even let me finish telling her it would take five minutes of her time, preferring to interject and tell me to go somewhere else. When I explained that Ive heard wonderful things about their business from friends, and that that sparked my interest, she said, ""Well, go somewhere else."" Ive never even been inside, and I sure as hell wont go now. Maybe its just me, but I dont like shopkeepers who snarl at their customers."
1,"So, theres no negative stars, too bad. Tried ordering take out before actually eating there to try it - good thing, you couldnt pay me to eat here. The only thing about the Colossal Cobb salad I ordered was the price. $10 and change for lettuce just enough to cover the bottom of the styrofoam with a sprinkle of toppings. Whered they get their chef, Chilis? What a disappointment. All the reviews say  a lot of food ...for who, an infant? I had also ordered a couple of carmelized cookies as well. Didnt know deep fried, greasy discs of oatmeal harder than concrete were called cookies. Good grief, the bakery wasnt even good! Had to spit those things out before they took out a filling.  The only good thing about Chandler Chompies is Jasons Deli right next door."
5,"A great place for midday healthy food, thin crust good pizza ( try wild mushroom & arugula), salads are great too & the best part that serve pretty acceptable nice wines. It is not an average American food eatery, it is definitely for those who are looking for healthy low calorie lunch."
4,This was my first time here. It was a nice experience.. And I found that I really like Indian food ! Good stuff !
4,"LOVE this place! I meet my husband here for lunch as often as I can. It is a bit pricey for being a fast food place but the food is so good. I always get the pita pizza and the pasta salad. Excellent place to eat. The decor is funky but the staff is usually really nice and again, the food is great!"
4,"This is a really good Starbucks location. Unlike a lot of the newer locations that have retro plastic chairs that look much more stylish than functional, it has lots of comfy upholstered chairs, plenty of plugs for web surfers, and a decently-sized outdoor seating area. The staff is really friendly and efficient as well. There is also a drive-through."
3,"decent.  the potstickers were kind of good.  I didnt really know what to expect.  it met my expectation.  the lychee pork was good and deserved the second helping.  the selection was impressive.  and the stuffed mushrooms had an interesting stuffing.  spam, was it?  some sort of sausage or other processed meat that made it quite a delightful surprise."
5,"Amanda at Butterfly Petals did the flowers for my wedding. I didnt want to spend  a lot on them and shaved it down to only needing my bouquet, three boutonnieres and two corsages. I told her what I liked and didnt and my budget. She created a bunch of options for me based on my specifics so I had a  number of choices. She also did all of this via email. which I give her total kudos for.  On the day of my wedding, there was a fabulous bouquet waiting for me as well as perfect corsages and boutonnieres for my groom and our parents. Amanda waited for me, even though I was terribly late, to make sure I was happy with her creations which really gave a personal touch. Butterfly Petals is creative and affordable. I love my bouquet so much that I ended up keeping it and I am having it preserved!"
5,"Who dosent like Cosco, I love this place. The pizza is cheap and good."
3,Its the kinda place where youre certain the employees dont spit in your food. Best Taco Bell Ive been to.
4,"I found this place when we needed a place to meet for a business lunch.  I had the smoked BBQ chicken which was good but that seems to be all I get when I go.  Ive tried some of the other dishes but havent really liked them.  My wife loves the fried pickles which Im not a fan of.  The portions are huge but there does not seem to be anything special I can remember besides really large portions.  I suppose the biscuits topped with sugar smothered in honey butter are good but I also want to live to be at least 50 and they are not worth dying for.  As unimpressed as I am with the food, the service is very good.  Ive been there a few times now and have always been pleased with they way they treat us.  Everything from the speed and attentiveness has been good."
5,"I work across the street and love me some Hava Java. The morning crew is very friendly, and the coffee is great. I am a big fan of the Swiss chocolate blend, (or any of the flavored blends for that matter!) they are really flavorful without tasting at all artificial. I buy Hava Java beans and brew them at home, but when I stop in for a quick cup of coffee I always have a good experience."
2,"I feel bad giving this 2 stars but Im basing it on other burger joints in the area. I recently Had a fab experience at Zinburger so this is why they are only getting 2 stars. Sat at the bar and ordered the cowboy Burger and adult choc milkshake ($14) pretty pricey and tasted just like a reg choc shake?? The burger bun on the bottom was extremely mushy and was not eaten. Overall I just have had better. All the burgers are $16, luckily we said ""happy birthday"" which is a deal thru today May 4th 3-6 PM that makes one burger free. Prob wont go back."
1,"False ads, do not stay there. Unless you dont mind a dirty, smelly, overrated hotel. The sheets and towels that were supposed to be white were gray. The place is run down and poorly serviced. The front lobby is clean but once you head up to your room you quickly find out that the place is run down and not being taken care of. I stayed on the fifth floor ""cabana suites"" and as soon as my elevator opened up on the fifth floor, I knew right away I stayed at the wrong place. The ""suites"" were nothing more than a room with a tiny bit of extra elbow space that are on the rooftop area with a pool in the front of the room. The pool was NASTY! (see pictures I uploaded) It was green and looked disgusting and when I arrived to take a look, it had an ""out of order"" sign placed at the entrance. This place was embarrassing! I had told my brothers to book there with me because we thought it was going to be a great hotel based on their website but we were very disappointed again!"
5,"A hole in the wall in South Phoenix....  I order: The ""Betty Boop"" - a plate with 1 waffle and 1 fried chicken breast.  Add a huge mason jar of the sweetest & reddest Koolaid (or Sweet Tea - depending on my mood) and a side of grits drowning in melted butter and Im a happy girl. Their Red Velvet Cake is also amazing.  I know fried chicken and waffles seem like an odd combination but its really interesting and satisfying - with the syrup and hot sauce for the chicken.... Yum Yum.   Its one of my familys favorites!!!   TRY IT!!!!"
4,Back in high school I used to work in metrocenter and this place still has the best lemonade I have ever had. I have not eaten the food from here so I have no idea on the quality.
5,"They have the nicest staff and the Dr. is always open when examining our dog! We have boarded her there as well and the staff is so kind, and when our dog gets there she cant wait to run up and play with the staff!"
4,"I first saw this place while I was on light rail going to basket ball game. The stop is nearby and it makes it easy to get to. The food here is very good! Everything I get here tastes home made and offers just the right amount of spice. Their salsas are very delicious! I always get the enchiladas or the bean burritos served enchilada style. Both the red and green sauce are very tasty. The service is always very fast and helpful. We came here late one night and were one of the only people left, but the waitress never hurried us and was very courteous."
5,"This place literally just opened.  I didnt really know what to expect, but when I walked in the doors I was immediately greeted by Nick, and he was very nice and down to earth.  This is a shop for people who like to garden/grow plants hydroponically or in the ground. They have all kinds of gardening supplies and Nick said they will be receiving their seed shipment from Seeds of Change any day now.  I will definitely be back, as my green thumb (or lack thereof) has been sparked:)  P.S. I was informed that the in the next issue of the New Times, Grotown will have an add to clip out and bring in to save 20% !!Yay plants:)"
4,"I recently went to my first First Friday (and my first trip to downtown Phoenix). After a few hours at the Phoenix Art Museum, friends and I hopped on the light rail and tried a new restaurant. Enter The Breadfruit. Easy to find (sign on the street corner) on a charming and quiet little street sits The Breadfruit with a hostess standing out front greeting guests. You can see the very intimate seating area from the street and it was packed (a good thing for 8:30pm on a Friday night). We sat and waited outside at the cute little tables (way too hot to eat a full meal outside). We were offered menus to peruse while we waited about 10 minutes for a table. Inside, we ordered two mixed drinks (a mojito vanilla for me). They were strong and very good. The mojito was very minty and refreshing and my mojito-loving friend said he should have ordered a mojito. (Read: Get a mojito.) The Food: We split a tilapia patty (very spicy!) for an appetizer. (Patties are Jamaican empanadas.)  I had the coconut curried tofu with rice and peas, ripe plantains, and veggies. This is the one of the best tofu dishes I have ever had. My only complaint is that Breadfruit needs to have more plantains per plate. They are so good! One friend had the curried chicken and dumpling with a green banana, veggies, plantains, and a side order of rice and peas. Although he didnt like the whole wheat dumpling, he loved the curry sauce and the green banana. He called the sauce ""delectable.""  Overall, this is a great place. Small, but great. The drinks are strong, the food is great, and the serve is prompt. Our only regrets are 1) not enough plantains and 2) we should have gotten dessert."
4,"I really like Maizies, but unfortunately will not get to go as often anymore. I hate to report that after our last visit, my husband received a bad bout of food poisoning. It was, in fact, his first time puking in approximately 10 years. It was not pleasant for him and it was not pleasant for me. For that reason, I guess Im going to have to drop one star from my previous review.  The thing is, I really love Maizies. I love their menu and I love their atmosphere. Unfortunately, the portobello sandwich...or maybe it was the cottage cheese...just doesnt love my husband and that means I dont get to visit quite as often.  :("
4,"The Saguro is a bright, happy place in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale and I, for one, am a big fan of bright, happy places (people, too but thats a story for another time.) It is set up more like an apartment and less like a hotel with lots of buildings scattered about, all surrounding a pool. (There is actually more than one pool to make this happen.) It definitely has more of a party vibe than some hotels, which is just fine by me. I can imagine during the summa, summa, summertime these pools are hopping.  And, even though the feel of the place is fun, the staff of the place is nothing less than professional. Every single person I interacted with was beyond kind, helpful, and happy. Whether you need a hotel room for a night or a full trip, a place to hang out poolside, a happy hour cocktail, a casual meeting place, or breakfast or lunch I think The Saguaro just might have you covered. And all with a smile.  Whats not to like about that?"
3,"I appreciate any airport restaurant that doesnt feel over-crowded or cramped.  We usually have to stop in Phoenix for our layover going to and from California from Texas, so I think this might be our new dinner spot.  Its big, plenty of seating, and clean. I love the affordable menu options...especially for being in an airport.  My husband and I both got the taco plates (mine steak and his fish) which come with two soft corn tortilla tacos, black beans, and rice.  The tacos were tasty but the rice and beans were flavorless and the rice seemed a bit undercooked.  After I drenched everything with hot sauce I was able to finish my meal. Although I love the cheap food options (around $6 for a taco or burrito meal), the drinks were super expensive.  Our Bloody Mary was $11!  My mango fresca (non-alcoholic) was about $4. The service was good and we dont really have any complaints.  This is a good option for someone looking for something not too greasy or heavy."
5,Ive been going here for 10 years. My relationship began when I needed a bunch of clothes tailored for my first trip to Europe. I needed everything quickly and was very specific. She got everything done in time for my trip.  Over the years Ive brought dozens of clothes. Shes done everything from changing a dress into a top to adding bra pads to a cocktail dress. Shes hemmed and taken in. Shes shortened straps and helped me change out fabric in clothing to create a completely different look. I can communicate anything I want and shell have it done exactly the way I envisioned it. Weve been able to change things so much we sometimes recreate new looks.  Her prices are a little high but well worth the quality. Every single person Ive recommended has been extremely pleased with her work.
5,"This is the location I frequent most (it helps it is less than a mile from my home).  I have been to a U.S. Egg (this and other locations) more than a dozen times (or two) since moving to AZ in 2010. I love breakfast food and the ""specialty"" won me over instantly; PROTEIN PANCAKES! As the timeless Tina Turner once said, ""Simply the Best!"". That describes these pancakes perfectly.  Before I go on and on about the pancakes (because I have been known to do so) some background information about atmosphere, staff etc.  This location is in a nondescript one story building in front of the offices at Mill Towne Center (or is it Mill Town Centre?). Nothing fancy, but I dont need a ""Jacket Required"" sort of feel to a place to enjoy my breakfast.  The staff is fantastic; hosts/hostesses, waitresses, busboys. I have never had anyone employed here be anything but 100% professional and attentive. To speak to something others have mentioned about getting the check early (while they are still eating); as long as you continue to be my waitress (i.e. refills, requests for jelly, etc.) I dont care if you bring the bill with the food. If I decide I want something else, I doubt any of the folks here would have a problem reprinting a corrected bill. Now on to the food!!  The protein pancakes are filled with blueberries, granola, cinnamon and silvered almonds. The ingredients arent something exotic, but they are perfectly balanced in the mix (not too much or too little of any of them). The thing about any food item you like at a restaurant, it becomes a favorite because they are able to duplicate it time after time. I have had this item many times (more than any other item), and they are always spot on (knock on wood) :).  All the other dishes I have had (always breakfast, havent tried lunch yet) were some combination of eggs and protein, and the eggs are always perfectly cooked to my specification (over medium), and the meat always juicy.  I promise to write another review as soon as I dont get the protein pancakes (which will be when they decide to remove them from the menu - NEVER). :) Oh, or if I actually go in later than normal and feel like lunch over breakfast (not good odds :O)."
1,"What.  The.   Heck. ??    Be prepared for sticker shock!  I walked in, through the store, and made a hasty straight line back to exit.  And over and across the road to Crate & Barrel  - Ahhhhhh - much better!  Whew!"
1,"Read al lthe hype, so decided to give Cyclo a try.  What a disappointment!  Portions were small and overpriced, owner thinks shes the next best thing to sliced bread.  She needs to go back to Vietnam to remember how real Vietnamese food is prepared. Give this place a miss."
5,"This place is the truth. It is easily one of the absolute best spots in Phoenix for Sonoran style Mexican cuisine. The chile colorado is so good, it made me try to slap my mama. The red sauce with the chips is actually brewed in the sixth level of hell. Awesome. Fridays feature $1.99 margaritas before 7 p.m. Swing by, start with the cheese crisp, grab any combo and revel in the gluttony."
5,"Do Taco Jedis work at Senor Taco?  Yes. Yes they do. Is the force of making killer fast Mexican food strong with these Jedis?  Oh hell yeah! Try the shredded beef tacos in the hard shells. When they ask you if you want hot sauce, say si and drizzle it mightily onto the tacos. Piled cheese, beef, lettuce, tomatoes all stuffed into an authentic-style taco shell - it doesnt get any better than this. Just make sure you put a helmet on because its crazy good. If you like spicy, no-nonsense burritos, go with the Carne Asada Burrito (Red Chile). If you like the whole meal, go with the Carne Asada or Pollo Asado burrito combo plates. The plate comes with flour tortillas, beans and rice, guacamole and salsa fresca. You make your own burritos. This is just good eatin. Take it home, crack open a good Hefeweizen, and you are golden. And lastly, from the sage words of my wife: ""The shrimp tacos and burritos are certified gourmet meals!"" Do I stutter? Nope. While Senor Taco is technically fast food it does take some time to prepare. If you do drive-thru dont get all road ragey if it takes longer than it does at Taco Bell. There is a price to pay to make good food and that price is TIME. This is not a worldwide chain that spends more on advertising and earning your business by putting cute little dogs on plastic mugs. Senor Taco is not that type of place. A little wait is very much worth it. I realize that appearance of the location irks some reviewers. Yes, it is in a strip mall. Yes it is 100-150 feet away from a gas station slash AM/PM mini market. I get that. But this is not Sanctuary. This is not Kai. This is not Deseo. When one reviewer (and I use the word reviewer loosely here) hilariously claims to have walked in, used his Superman vision to supposedly spot a family of offending microbes and (without trying the food) proceeded to sprint out because he was frightened of all the imagined cooties ... well... I just have to laugh. Thats not a review, its a drive-by, and reviewers like this are probably happier with Hometown Buffet or Lubys Cafeteria. And thats too bad because this is excellent fast food. Ive eaten here maybe 15-20 times and my wife has ordered the fish taco plate a number of times and neither of us has ever gotten sick. The people at Senor Taco are nice, the food pleasantly surprises and your expectation of fast Mexican food will be forever changed for the better. I cant recommend highly enough."
2,"I had dinner at the Thai Rama two days ago. It wasnt an awful dining experience, but Im not sure I would go here again.  My friend and I ordered the egg rolls (sorry, I dont remember the Thai name), and they were okay. Two pieces, small (but the price was $2, so what did I expect?), and an average filling - something I would expect from frozen egg rolls. Were both vegetarians and were happy to see a vegetarian section in the menu, but were slightly disappointed with the options. Three of the items included oyster sauce, and the other three were either vegetarian fried rice or red/green curry vegetables. I ordered the green curry vegetables (medium hot), and my friend ordered the red curry vegetables (mild - and she stressed MILD). We waited 20 minutes for our dinner to arrive. I didnt mind my dish - it was waaaaay spicier than medium, but I dont mind a little heat. The sauce was very runny, and the vegetables were soggy and looked they had been sitting in the sauce for quite a while. My friend didnt like her dish at all, mostly because it was quite spicy for being a mild dish. We spent $25 total, and Im not sure it was worth it. The service was slow, but the waitresses were very friendly. Overall, I would probably not recommend this restaurant to a friend."
5,"Best Italian sub Ive had. Very nice owners. Just be aware theres no place to sit, so youll have to get it to go."
4,"We went here because it was the only decent place we could find open after the Suns game. Fresh fish sandwich was delicious, as well as the shoestring fries. Great service, nice vibe, Id go back."
4,"At the recommendation of a friend, I met a client here for lunch.  My client was arriving from out of town and this joint is very conveniently located near the airport.  I guess once upon a time, it was an actual stockyard.  Now, its an old school restaurant that has a lot of character. After browsing the menu, I opted for a BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich & Fries, $10.  To wash it down, I ordered Iced Tea. The Pork Sandwich was awesome, very tasty and a large portion.  You will get full.  The Fries were tasty as well. My client was impressed with the restaurant and put it on his ""best place near the airport to have a lunch meeting"" list....+++ The service was great and we were able to have a good lunch meeting that left us both satisfied. Return Factor - 100%"
3,"Marcellas does have its downside, but today Im in a good mood and I am recommending you stop in for the following three reasons: 1.) They bring absolutely delicious bread (including olive oil) to your table almost immediately. I love this and I love their bread. 2.) You can sit on a ""patio"" inside the mall and have the most amazing people-watching experience. Fashion Square shoppers can be quite entertaining. 3.) The Amalfi Spritzer might just be my favorite cocktail of all time. Vodka + passion fruit + basil = HEAVEN. Plus, they use those cute little cylinder-shaped ice cubes that somehow make the drink even better."
5,Mastros serves up the best steak in Scottsdale.  They also offer delicious seafood and excellent side dishes.  Prices are steep. After 10pm this place becomes a pick up joint for gold digging women seeking sugar daddys.
4,"I had no idea they were open for lunch! Perfect since the boy and I were down town during lunch the other day.  We stopped in around 2:30 inthe afternoon. No Wait! I couldnt even believe it. I hadnt eaten there since I was a little girl, but it was just as good as I remember. We got a couple beers and split the Margarita Pizza. It was sooo yummy! Perfectly crispy on the edges and lots of flavor. The service was a tini bit slow, but no big deal, we loved it.  If you want great pizza and dont want to wait the normal 3 hours during dinner, you should hit up Pizzaria Bianco while the sun is still up, less wait time if at all.  Enjoy!!"
3,"I just dont think Im much of a brewery gal. Granted, the beer here blows Four Peaks out of the water, but Id much rather have a nice cocktail than chew though a specialty brew. But if beer is your poison of choice, theyve got just about everything. The happy hour is kind of weak here though, with like a buck off all drafts. Thoroughly meh. You can peruse the coolers and grab a cold one or choose from 20+ drafts they have on the menu. No Bud Light here though. Sorry frat chumps. They used to have a ton of wine here as well (like, ages ago) but it has since been narrowed down to just four choices, none of which were calling my name this last go round. Their Orange Blossom wheat beer was a bit like drinking an orange creamsicle in beer form. Almost like a cider with floral notes, a light finish and a super creamy mouthfeel. (Oh yeah, bitches. I just went there.) The perfect beer for the novice drinker to enjoy. Their IPA was also pretty decent, but was more bitter than I care for, although it stayed far away from feeling like I was drinking a bottle of grassy perfume. Solid. I thought they had deals on happy hour food (again, like a buck off) but last time I went it was no dice. At least the foods reasonably priced. Tasty rueben, craptastic hummus, crispy quesadilla.  The acoustics in this place are kind of shitty, so go on an off time when it wont be packed, or run the risk of smiling and nodding amicably while hearing every other snippet of convo. The high top tables are also really uncomfortable for shorties like me to sit at, but cest la vie. My biggest peeve about this place is the gigando assy television against the wall. For a place this small, a big ass mofo tv is just  not the way to go."
4,"This Mexican food is very simple, slightly bland, but fairly fresh. The chicken is chopped up into tofu-looking squares. But I was satisfied with the food, which was fairly healthy Mexican food as Mexican food goes. The staff is quite polite. I met some cool people hanging out there while I sat outside."
5,"Always a healthy, fresh meal. One of my favorites is the hummus and grilled chicken appetizer(which is gynormous) and I have them add in some tabbouleh, then cucumbers on the side. Perfection. All the pitas, and the seasonal specials are always super good. Wine is also inexpensive if the mood strikes. Otherwise, great casual lunch and dinner spot that is extremely reasonable in price for the quality of food you are getting. There is something for everyone here, veggies, kids, etc. If I ever moved from AZ, this is the first place I would come visit upon my return. Parking can get hairy at the Arcadia location, and one time someone actually backed into my car when I was legally parked along a curb but that is hardly Pita Jungles fault. The douche didnt even leave a note - but I digress and karma is real and nothing would keep me from coming back to Pita!"
4,"I was only able to play the front 9; my wrist was hurting too much to finish, which is a big deal because I live in IL, and was returning from LA and stopped here specifically to play the TPC. Oh well. I was a single, and got paired with another. The course was pretty open, but we took our time and enjoyed the round. The front nine, although rarely shown on TV, is quite nice. Definitely challenging enough, and I didnt even play the back tees. It was fairly easy to get on, the bar had pretty good food for a clubhouse, and the staff were very helpful. Definitely recommend the TPC."
3,"Even though I am officially in my 30s, I look like Im still in college, which made me feel slightly less uncomfortable when I walked into The Clubhouse. Yes, it is near ASU, and yes, it is an all-age venue, so I should have expected that the club would be filled with 18-20 somethings. But just because I look 21, doesnt mean that my internal reality made me feel a little out-of-place. But, I was like, whateva! It is somewhat of a dive bar trying to be a club but failing miserably. Like a nerd trying to be punk or a cheerleader trying to be emo -- it somehow didnt work for me. It felt like I was in someones basement turned rockers haven. Black walls, haphazard decor, and one sole stinky quasi-couch that looked like it had been salvaged from some dump.  The stage was at the front of the club, and the bar in the middle dissected the under-21 crowd from the over-21 boozers. Unfortunately, if you wanted to drink, you had to stay on the over-21 side of the bar. That sucked because you barely had a view of the stage. WTF?!  Shouldnt the paying lushes get a better view than the youngsters who only paid to get in the club? Stupid. I have to say, though, the sound system was a helluva lot better than some of the other small music venues Ive been to.  Thats a plus.   Finally, this last annoyance will definitely show my age, but having to stand the entire time I was there was horrible. My feet hurt, dammit! And, I just wanted to sit down! But, Ill suck it up the next time because there are some great bands that play here, and for me, great music can make any situation better."
5,"Excellent service!!!! I had to find a spa different from lavenders after they got rid of yet another excellent staff member, so I tried this place! I was SO HAPPY!! clean, pleasant, warm, comforting. The manager is actually on site and aware of the things going on in their spa! The staff is friendly and efficient!  Lavenders day spa can learn from this place. Send the owner from lavenders to sanity and TAKE NOTES.  I HIGHLY recommend it here!!!!!! Go and enjoy!!!"
4,"If you want a good neighborhood bar, Ernies is exactly that. This is the place I go when Im not looking to get all dolled up but I still want to go out. There is nothing unique about it, it is just a bar that is good at being a bar. It also has all of the best activities for drinking.  I LOVE shuffleboard and a dive-bar is not a dive-bar without it. Great thing about theirs is it is in the patio area so you can smoke while playing (I smoke when I drink, yes filthy, disgusting habit Im aware) ...sometimes they charge like five bucks for the pucks other times not, depends on the bartender I think.  They also have two pool tables, and I think golden tee.  Their is a room that has karaoke. I am a singer and enjoy karaoke from time to time, the night I participated there were some amazing singers and it was really fun to listen to everyone. The karaoke DJ. has a really good selection of songs, lots to choose from you will probably find what you are looking for.  I tend to get hit on every time Im there which I guess is an ego boost but I would prefer to be left alone at a place like this. Im usually in the mood to do my own thing with my own friends at a place like this and dont feel like making new friends but thats just me.  Not sure about their drink selection, I always just get Michelob Ultra (lame I know) or cranberry/vodka...the mixed drinks are strong, their well is gross though but to be expected.  Always a good laid back time at Ernies. They can count on me as a regular."
5,"Disclaimer: Like many of you, I am a sucker for charming little homes that have been re-purposed into restaurants. I am certain that this colored my opinion of Cibo. That being said, I absolutely love having lunch here the other day. I unknowingly arrived at 2:05 (5 minutes after they close between lunch and dinner) but was served anyway. I had the salscicia sandwich and a side of fruit. The sandwich was excellent, served on perfectly crisp, chewy saltimbocca bread. The sausage was flavorful and was complimented by roasted red peppers and onions. All this was finished off with a great quality mozzarella cheese. Really, really delicious. I should also say that the atmosphere here was friendly and  comfortable, though a bit small. This would be a great place to hang out if you lived nearby."
3,"Better than rubios or filabertos by a long shot open late and has a drive through. When i walked in it was packed and i noticed how cheap the beer and Margaritas were. Wait... I dont remember having ever seen a hole-in-the wall Mexican spot serving booze before (wonder if they sell it via drive through). The menu is like a Jewish Torah being that it has a 100,000 words and is very hard to read. The tacos and burritos also come w/ a side of toquitos that is buried under chiuaua cheese and guacamole. Shrimp and fish tacos are made on tortillas are made in house. Food is super cheap and tasty. Its too bad that all their locations are in the middle of nowhere."
5,Love this place.  Friendly staff. Always a treat to see whats cooking on the weekend. I dont mind standing in line to order. Great way to meet new friends and talk to old ones. Ask Kiersten about the cortadito.
4,"-Biggest Joanns store -Great fabric selection -Clean store, good layout (different from other Joann stores) -Convenient location (parking is not too bad). -Employees are friendly. -Restrooms are blah and smell."
4,"Over the last 3 years weve lived in the area, this place has changed 4 times.  First Uncle Bears, then Tio Osos, then Thirsty Cactus (or Thirsty Cantina, whatever, it sucked), and now its TCs Pub & Grub.  The menu is typical bar food, including burgers, sandwiches, pizza, wings as well as some taco and quesadilla selections (which I always appreciate a good quesadilla so I will have to try it next time).  The restaurant section (which was always dead before) has now been opened up and TVs added so the whole place is more of a bar feel (thumbs up).  The place was packed for Thursday night football (Cardinals game!), but still got a good table close to a TV.   Server (who admitted multiple times he was brand new) was very friendly but had to keep asking other servers for clarification on menu, etc.  Still, nice enough and very attentive. We ordered wings (""medium"" but they were spicy!) and their ""ugly"" crust pizza with mushrooms and olives.  The wings, very good, I would get them again.  Pizza, I wouldnt order it again if someone paid me.  The ""ugly"" crust basically is a thick hand tossed crust - too much crust (and half of it was burned) and very skimpy on the toppings.  It was pretty horrible honestly.  The actual toppings (although sparse) were very tasty... good cheese and fresh mushrooms and olives, so I would order pizza here again IF they have a thinner crust option.  Otherwise, if you are coming here to carb load and really need your bread fix, by all means, order the pizza.  I personally prefer a thinner NY style crust. All in all I would come here again based on the good wings and service, and Im looking forward to trying their other menu options.  p.s. text TCSPUB to 411247 and theyll send you a text coupon for a 50 cent draft. Score! (Im a sucker for a deal)  Cheers!"
3,"was super duper busy when i ordered. but then again, they were a fast food place, and i waited for my To Go order for 25 minutes. They have 5 or 6 people inside their kitchen. And a lot were waiting for their food cos there were some mixed up. Will go back though cos I know those things happen when its a busy day. The food was bomb specially the hotdog!"
4,"Considering this is the only gym Ive ever been in, its great! They have updated equipment and lots of them. I usually go during one of the busy times and can always get on a machine, or do the things I want to. Plus they have classes which are good. And every time me & my boyfriend walk in & out of the Y, a nice gal at the food counter greets us and says goodbye. We still never order anything, though... They lose a star though because I HATE WORKING OUT!  Sigh..."
5,So perfect. The atmosphere is just spot on. I love going whether its just to grab coffee and leave or if I am there studying or just want to chill. I love their Apple Harvest (?) salad. So delicious and beautifully prepared. Baristas are always very nice (especially Brianna!). Cant wait to hopefully become a regular and attend some of the live music events they put on every week!!
5,"If you want a deal for your buck, this is the place to go! Youll find Dewalt, Makita, Oster, Cuisinart, Farberware, Keurig, and many other banded items for a fraction of the original retail price. Yes, some items will be out the package, missing a manual, or may have a scratch or a dent but I rather pay a fraction of the price versus paying full retail at a department store. I rather save money and get a ridiculous deal for the same exact item I would have paid 10X more at a well organized and clean shop. From what I know this store has been open for nearly ten years; the owners are one of the nicest people Ive met; they even offer free delivery with the furniture or any other large item you purchase. Stop by!! Youll get a kick from just walking down the unorganized, messy aisles; but once you get to the register to pay- youll be happy!! ""Get more for less!"""
1,"Its a good concept if the owners / mismanagement had bothered to keep a trendy or classy atmosphere. As it is save your money get fast food - McDonalds has less grease. We had to ask for plates for the appetizer platter (it is meant to be shared) so the sever handed my daughter 4 paper plates.  My salad wasnt a salad it was a paper plate of mixed greens - really no tomatoes, nothing on it or in it other than lettuce and she threw a packet of Newmans Dressing on the table just like the ones you get at Burger King or McDonalds. My steak - it was OK - I asked for medium and got medium well and that was the best part of it. The steak is served on a paper plate and when I asked about utensils I was directed to go get my own from around the corner - yup plastic ware for a steak on a paper plate. My daughter had a burger and it was so greasy the bun turned soggy brown part way through then fell completely apart. Service? Well lets just pretend this place is 100% do it yourself then it would be OK. The waitress walked away before my daughter finished her order. Never came back and asked how things were, nothing. Really if we were the kind to dine & dash it wouldnt have been a problem because she wouldnt have known we were gone. My daughter actually had to go find the server and ask for the bill!!!! What kills me is the employees exude an I dont care attitude which is also obvious in their actions (or lack of actions) and the message I got was the owner / mis-management has accepted this lazy unfriendly service because its obvious by how poorly the place is run that its OK with them. It could be great but they would need to make a lot of changes - job 1 fire everyone & start over. If I could have given them 1/2 a star I would have - we wont be going back."
5,"Yes, it is probably as good as it gets for a SANDWICH place. Very tasty. All 3 of us liked our different sandwiches. I also ordered pasta salad but it really was not any good, but it does not matter as i did not come there for a pasta salad. Real good besides that."
5,"The BEST of the BEST! I agree with Daren C.  Killer Burgers, Steaks, Prime Rib and of course ribs. Food melts in your mouth.  Make this your next restaurant stop.  You will not be disappointed."
5,"Seriously soo good! Drove 60miles to come here about 5 times in the 3 months that I lived in AZ.  I came here because of the triple D episode and it was soo worth it! Burgers, fries, onion rings, sweet potatoe fries and pizza are ALL GOOD!  and check out their bathrooms.. its pretty cool too.  Tried Joes Real BBQ, which is their first restaurant but it was just OK.  Joes Farm grill is def. one of my fav places.."
2,"I cook better pasta than them, and I am not much of a cook. The pasta I had (I believe it was a marinara dish with penne pasta) was awfully bland. Sauce didnt mix well with the pasta either. The texture of the pasta was funky, hanging out on its own. If I wanted bland pasta I would buy a can of Presto and penne pasta, boil them together and add some water :p The server was attentive enough to notice and brought me more sauce. I did like the service and how they had the giant white piece of paper and crayons on the table so I could doodle while I waited. The waitress was very attentive and friendly. Appetizer: calamari was yummy. I just wish they could kick it up a notch on the pasta with richer sauces, seasoning, texture, more tomato/meat/cheese and really blending it with their pasta.   But I guess that would raise costs/prices huh. :/"
4,"Huge fan of this bistro. Everyday or two there is a new exotic meat that you must try. The staff is super awesome and Brant is my go to guy. I highly recommend sangria sundays, the wagyu and veggie burger are my absolute favorites. Not to mention, the sweet potato fries and Purple Haze beer.  If you like sliders, this is the best place to go in scottsdale."
2,"Boring.  Uninspired.  Generally sauce-less, which means the meat courses are plain and dry.  The salmon tastes like styrofoam.  The filet is flavorful but they use low quality cuts.  The veggies are simply steamed.  No doubt the options are healthy, but at the sacrifice of flavor.  When I pay this much to eat out, I want to taste it and enjoy it."
5,"I absolutely LOVE Club SAR! I joined back in 2010 (I think...). At first, I just went there with my ex (who lived in So Cal and had been boxing) because I have always loved the sport of boxing and wanted to get into it myself (maybe even join the boxing team).  Sadly, I exceeded the age limit to join the boxing team, by a few years...  :-( But, at least I could still learn and get fit.  :-) We just walked up to the entrance and just took one quick look around and it seemed crowded and small so we were not impressed. So, we left. I found out this used to be just a boxing gym before but eventually they added other classes and equipment for others to enjoy.  Glad I went back later on my own and found out how affordable it was! I checked and tried a few other Fitness centers and gyms nearby but, when I decided to actually try one of Club SARs boxing classes, I was hooked! For a mere $3  (a day) drop-by fee, I was able to get one of the best workouts I ever had. I joined after I found out it only cost $75 for the whole YEAR which includes ALL the classes I can take (Boxing, boxing conditioning, Yoga, spin class, kickboxing, weight training, MMA... Yes! MMA too, which I personally love.  :-) ). Jonathan & Carlos are great and so is Tom. Theyre funny, friendly, and they actually remember you after only a few classes.  The pricing has gone up this year but it is still by far, the BEST possible deal you can find anywhere in the Valley.  Fees    YEARLY Membership  Resident    Non-Resident  Adult (18+ years)       $99                  $150  Child (14-17 years)    $50                  $75  Daily Drop-In Fee $3 Residents; $5 Non-Residents   If you are serious about getting fit, staying in shape and getting a good old-fashioned workout without all the ""posing"" and pretentiousness of other gyms which are more like ""meeting places"" and ""meat markets"" for the young Scottsdale wannabes, this gym is definitely for you! Personally, I recommend the boxing classes because they will kick your butt, they are fun, get you fit and, in shape. :-) They just got new heavy bags so there are 2 heavy bags, 1 hooks bag, several ""Bob bags"", 2- double-ended bags and 3 speed bags in the main workout areas. Plus, a bunch more standing weighted-base heavy bags in the other ""kickboxing/Yoga room. And, in case you didnt notice from the picture, a full-size boxing ring.  Yes. I am totally endorsing this gym!  P.S. This is a ""no frills"", serious gym.  So, no whinnying and crying. Suck it up and do some push-ups!  ;-) Call them for more details:  (480) 312-2669"
5,"Theres a reason theres a banner that reads, Food Network Challenge Winner, hanging in their farmer market booth. Ive had Pastry Chef Chriss gingerbread cookies; biscotti; coconut/chocolate cookies; and their carrot cake, and they have all been really, really, reaaaaally good!  But today, at the Ahwatukee Farmers Market, I was knocked out by what she calls ""Lemon Sunshine.""  Words can not describe how delicious their lemon and cream & graham crust tart/pie is. Lemon tarts/pies are among my all time favorite desserts. I thought that the ones I had from TKs bakeries and Veronique Mauclerc were as perfect as a lemon tart/pie could be. Slice Cake Designs Lemon Sunshine pie is dangerously perfect... A must try!!!!!"
4,"Ive been frequenting the Dollar store for the past three weeks while shopping for a work project. I have bought just about every pair of safety scissors in Phoenix, playdough, and other small manipulatives for elementary reading and math kids. Anytime I need cleaning supplies for home I head straight to this Dollar Tree Store. They have the BEST carpet cleaner called LAs Totally Awesome Carpet Spot and Stain Remover. It really works!! The Dollar Tree is a great place to stock up on cheap party decorations. Shopping at the Dollar Tree is kinda like buying a Saturn. You know the price before you walk in and how much youre going to spend before you check out. I love that!"
4,"Ive been here three times now and have yet to have a bad meal, or walk away complaining. The food is consistent. The prices are fair. And the service is great. Nice hidden gem without stupid long waits at breakfast. Score!"
1,This place is over priced and the service is horrible. I went there with my feiends and the server was very rude and degrading!
3,"Average Cajun food, nothing special.  I came here late on a Tuesday night.  Few people there.  Its a dive of a place in a strip mall.  A bluesman was playing nice quiet blues on an electric guitar...very nice.  Kinda scruffy place with all the basic Cajun staples.  Nothing fancy.  Decent brews.  I think the bar tender was waiting tables.  I probably wont be back, but I had heard it was great and wanted to try it.  I think I like more upscale digs and fancier/pricier fare."
4,"Awesome Saturday breakfast buffet (until 11am). I wanted a resort style brunch setting to treat my folks too while they were in town. The service here is impeccable as are the grounds, which deserve a good walking through after you gorge yourself on heaps of fresh fruit, pastries, bacon and eggs. Located in central Scottsdale."
1,"The worst Thai food Ive ever had! This place was recommended to us by another couple, and wow was I disappointed! Everything was completely blase and tasteless, the only exception being the extreme spiciness of my fiances entree(probably to make up for the lack of other spices)... dont bother with this place."
3,"This is simply a poor substitute for the Los Dos Molinos in South Phoenix.  It is a pale shade of itself.  The salsa is spicy, but it doesnt have any of the same excitement.  I think its partly the downtown location in a strip mall, (not that 98% of restaurants in Phoenix arent in strip malls).  But the Mexcian Pizza and Chicken enchiladas just didnt have the same loving kick and spice.  When you are craving Mexican downtown, thisll do in a pinch.  But make room and time to head out to the original deal, the one with 5 alarm salsa and huge patios.  Margaritas the size of ones head and bring a group of friends to indulge!"
4,"Though perhaps not the place you may pick for a special brunch with champagne and chocolate brioche French toast (a signature breakfast at the Sofitel Philadelphia), the Good Egg is my choice for neighborhood breakfast that offers consistent service and food in a comfortable atmosphere. No matter how busy the restaurant becomes, and on Sunday it is packed,  the staff is always friendly and welcoming. You may have to wait for a table but the waits are never excessive and there is the coffee trolley where you can help yourself while waiting.  Even more remarkable is that even at its busiest (read Mothers/ Fathers days), service is speedy and attentive and the kitchen never seems to slow down.  Someone here knows how to run a restaurant! The menu contains a large assortment of the usual breakfast fare, eggs, pancakes, french toast, etc, all well prepared and tasty.  In addition there are is a good number of health conscious offerings and even those less healthy dishes can be requested to be made with egg whites or egg beaters, and non-starch substitutes (cottage cheese, fruit, and tomatoes. etc).  Some of my favorites include the Hey Ricky Omelet, Huevos Ranchero ,or my indulgence a (as in one huge singular)  buckwheat pancake with (my choice of ""fillings): chocolate chips ( I admit my addictions), pecans, and bananas...  We always opt for the patio and even in the scorching summer heat; the misters make this a great outdoor picnic with the best people watching in Phoenix. After you have been here a few times you feel like part of the family and with their frequent dinner program they offer even more incentive to return."
2,"The queso is ridiculously good... seriously. And the homemade tortillas are also outstanding. Aside from that, everything is average at best. As mentioned by others, this is Americanized Mexican cuisine. This is not autentica comida Mexicana, mi amigos! We had been once before and thoroughly enjoyed the food. Hence making it a point to visit again on our most recent trip to Arizona. We started with the chips and salsa set for the table - delicious. I ordered a bunch of queso for the table, and I started with a Tortilla Soup. It was hilariously underwhelming. I made the joke that it was kitchen scraps, and it looked the part. It was light tomato broth with a bunch of vegetables, a gob of cheese and a small corn on the cob on top. Yes, a small corn on the cob is on top. It was lousy and I wouldnt recommend it. We ordered a pound of chicken fajitas and a half pound of vegetable ones (thanks to the vegetarian fiancee). It went surprisingly far for five of us... but the veggies werent grilled much, which is sad because they were otherwise delicious. Also, the chicken fajitas only had one piece of green pepper and one of red on top. It should be lush with peppers and onions that have been grilled or possibly even caramelized (the onions). Daniel E. wrote in his review the same concern, that there should be ""more than a pile of onions,"" that he expected at least some green, red or yellow peppers. The fajitas were good and quite filling. The accompaniments were decent - cheese, lettuce, sour cream and the like. Nothing fancy, certainly no frills. So much potential, but it fails on almost everything. Its a true shame. This place needs to be on Restaurant Impossible with Robert Irvine... badly... This time around... the service was really lousy. And my fiancee found a bug deep down in her water. Very disappointing. The waitress first replied confirming what size bug it was, and then explained it and claimed that ""were not dirty, its just the food smell."" Then she apologized and walked away. We think she deducted a soda from the final bill... but nothing else. A bug! And the entry foyer smelled like a high school locker room... it was foul on the way in and out. Sad to say that we may likely not return in the future. Im not sure if our family and friends in the greater Phoenix area will either after the bug incident."
5,"I saw the reviews of this Arribas and thought to myself, ""Are these people talking about the same Arribas I went to last night?"" I went there, and had an awesome time! Service was prompt, and if something was off, our server Jeff (who was amazing) explained why something happened, but didnt blame anyone, and didnt use server jargon. I do understand the jargon, but it was nice for someone to not have to resort to it.  Warm chips and salsas + warm bean dip came out = awesome and the spicy salsa was calling my name. It burned, but I loved it. I ordered the Rio Grande enchiladas with the carne abodoba, and ordered it extra spicy. (Of course, I would) I was with my girl (and she likes strawberry margaritas) so we split the house margarita for 2, frozen with sugar of course. Im not a huge margarita person, but it was really good. She ordered the cheese enchiladas. (She takes safe choices when we go eat) -more on the margaritas in a min-  Food come out and seriously, it was some of the best spanish/mexican Ive had in a while. Its good to see an establishment take risks with seasoning their food. It was fresh! Which is hard to find these days and Im pretty sure the people who own Arribas own a hatch chile farm because I rarely saw anything about jalapenos or serranos or even habaneros. Which is cool. Those hatch chiles are slanged around that place like coke in studio 54 in the 70s. Im not kidding, when you order your entree and they ask you what kind of beans you want. Black, pinto, or the 3rd kind that is a combo of black/pinto with some onion, tomatoes, and of course, whats that? Hatch chiles! I highly recommend them. I liked how Arribas uses the hatch chiles. It sets them apart. It brought the heat! After dinner, I ordered another margarita... This time, I asked Jeff of a recommendation. Why do I do this? Because the people that work at any restaurant know the food/drinks there more than you will ever know. Nuff said. He brought out some margarita I dont even know the name. It kicked my ass, thank god my girl was driving home, thats all Im going to say. Thanks! Thats why this place gets 5 stars. It deserves it in my opinion. I think because this place takes chances with seasoning and overall outlook is why so many people might be unhappy with Arribas or this location in general. I on the other hand PROMOTE this thought process. I dont want food thats bland that a place kicks off the line to the people outside than enjoy bland food. That makes for a BLAND place thats filled with, well, bland people. This place uses heat, salt, pepper, and other spices that I dont know of. What a freaking great idea! Too hot for you? Then dont eat food that is 99% based on heat. I will surely be going back, and I wont have a bad time."
1,"I cant even believe I actually went to this restaurant.  My feeling was that if the Tommy Bahama clothing and its wearers were any indication of the dining experience, it was going to be unoriginal and in poor taste.  Alas my friend wanted to go there was his birthday lunch so....  Let me be clear that Im not a food snob at all.  Just last week I enjoyed a lunch of Nachos Bell Grande and a bean and cheese burrito at Taco Bell very, very much.  That was far superior to this lunch at Tommy Bahama.  The decor was comfortable and breezy.  Everything else  - not so much.  1st its nice that they bring you bread and butter, but a sweetly flavored butter?  Why mess with the pure goodness of butter?  The glass of lemonade I ordered was sickeningly sweet, and I am a notorious for my sweet tooth.  It was undrinkable until I cut it with water.  The coconut shrimp also had an overly sweet sauce.  So much so that we could each only eat 1 of 6 shrimp.  I got the crab bisque which was crazy salty, and in my opinion, contained previously frozen hence rubbery crab meat.   As it was my friends birthday, they brought him a complimentary dessert.  Very nice. He got the newest one which was some sort of chocolate/caramel-filled cake with oreo crust, chocolate mousse topping, sprinkled with crushed Heath bar.  Sounds good, right?  Vile, absolutely vile.  Overly sweet except for the oreo crust that was saturated in butter.  On an update note - it was not the nasty sweet butter they serve with the bread though.     My final issue was with our young, highly attentive server.  He was very sweet and well-intentioned.  However I feel that every server in the world needs to stop speaking to customers in the collective.  Dont say ""are we enjoying our coconut shrimp?"" or ""are we ready for dessert?""  Unless Ive badly misinterpreted our relationship, ""we"" arent doing anything together. Just a pet peeve -  I still tipped him 22% and kept my mouth shut about this odd little quirk.   oh and the bill for coconut shrimp appy, quesadilla, cup of crab bisque, lemonade and glass of white wine?  $52.  for lunch.   Tommy Bahama and I just didnt work out at all."
5,"As a bonafide recovering Art Bitch, I give this university gallery the blue ribbon award for kickassery! Truly a ""hidden gem"" (i hate that phrase) in Tucson, the collection and the revolving pieces never cease to impress me. I have brought almost every single tourist from the east coast to this gallery, including some photography professors, and they leave with snoooty mouths agape that in this pleasant little desert town resides a high-caliber, well manicured collection of the arts.  I am always upset when I visit and I cant stop by this gallery-and dont miss out out on their catalogs, magazines, books, postcards and prints they have in the atrium as unique gifts/decoration. Splleeeendid."
4,"Finally tried the only ""real"" Chinese food restaurant in Maricopa.  Played it safe with Sweet & Sour Chicken, Crab Rangoon, and Pork Fried Rice.  With delivery, it was only $14 +tip.   The fried rice was great, it was a little more of the ""East Coast"" style I grew up with, dark w/ lots of juicy nuggets of roast pork.  The chicken was good, but then again, it was a (VERY) safe choice, next time Ill try one of the ""Chefs Specialties"".  Crab Rangoon was good, unlike Panda Express, there was crab (krab?) in the cream cheese.   If youre in Maricopa and craving Chinese, dont go to Panda Express, definitely give Great Wall a try, its in the same plaza as Panda and if your party is 2 or more, youll save yourself some money!"
1,"I am a huge tea drinker, so when I found out about Teavana I was excited.  I entered the store and an employee asked if I cared to try some tea. After sampling several different blends, I chose three to purchase.  The employee asked if I wanted to get a large canister for a dollar more than the one I had picked. Not realizing this store sells tea by the ounce rather than per canister, I said ""sure."" He chatted as he filled the containers, never mentioning the price, and once done took my debit card and rang me up. I didnt pay attention to the cost and when I looked at the receipt when I got home my heart nearly stopped. I spent $350 on tea. I returned it and they didnt give me too much trouble. Now I always check the total before handing my card over, and I wont go back. I feel like they totally swindled me."
4,Not a bad theater. The staff is friendly and the sound is ok.
1,I dont get it. This place is crazy busy with no Manager in sight and in hiding during the busy dinner hour. No name tags on the employees. I was scolded for pointing over the sneeze glass to the sauce that I wanted since nothing was labeled. I guess I violated the health code. Thanks for not locking me up. I told my family we will not spend one more dime here.
4,I have been here twice so I know whats the best items for my taste. Would give another star if the Mongolian grill had more items and sauces. Trying the evening buffet tomorrow with 2 teenage sons one whose 18 and a football player. Should definitely get my moneys worth!
5,"This is a great MMA gym.  Instructors are profesional, the facility is clean, and they work well with all experience levels."
5,"We just moved from Florida and I was looking for a Restaurant with great food, service and a great view to celebrate my husbands 61st Birthday on Friday. It was suggested by a friend to try A Different Point of View... We are so glad we did... Let start by saying the drive up the cliffs to the restaurant was an adventure my Kia wasnt happy about but we made it.. AMAZING views... Greeted by a valet who had plenty of energy and was very informative. We picked the elevator to go to the 4th floor as opposed to the stairs... We were seated in a corner window table with views beyond belief! Greeted by our server , Larry, he wished my husband Happy Birthday and brought a passion fruit drink that was delish compliments of the Chef! Nice touch... Ask for Larry if you go.. he was right in tune with our special requests... We ordered their Signature Salad and I said we would share it... Larry had the kitchen serve it as a split.. Larry made the dinner and celebration very Special. My husband ordered the Rib Eye but my husband doesnt like any thing on his rib eye and doesnt like anything else on his plate with the meat.. Larry must hears this all the time and he explained exactly how it will be plated and assured him that no sauce or veggies would touch the meat. See pictures to see our meals. I held my breath until the plates came out and my Husband loved it- it was perfect. He ordered it medium rare and it came out perfectly cooked and full of flavor and it cut like butter. I ordered the Pork Tenderloin and it was tender and full of flavor the corn cakes were like little polenta pancakes they were delishish... The bread and the specialty butter and pesto and goat cheese dips were also full of flavor...  The dessert was a Chocolate Espresso cake also very good. The sun was setting and the lights were twinkling-- Just a wonderful experience..  I cant wait to go back when its a little cooler to sit outside...Dont miss this wonderful casual affordable piece of Heaven!"
5,"The food was absolutely delicious.  Was very surprised in finding a good Asian restaurant here in Phoenix.  We had the papaya salad with soft shell crab, Phnom Penh noodle soup, and the lehong noodles.  All were delicious and very SE Asian.  I could not believe how great the food was.  But the best part was the grass jelly drink - it brought me back to my childhood.  Cant wait to try the other dishes here.  A definite must try here in Phoenix."
2,"I am changing my review - lately because of bad economy, they are not getting enough customers, their food quality has gone down. I wont waste my time or money on this."
5,This place is awesome they r going to replace a bad  tire for me for free that another discount tire put on they r awesome
3,"Ive been to happy hour here on a few occasions now and I have to say that Im becoming more and more fond of Geisha. The prices are pretty decent, but what really makes this a great happy hour place is the ambience - its lively and fun! Happy hour is 4p - 7p every day and is half off sake bombs, appetizers, house sushi rolls...and I just realized specialty drinks as well! I need to go back so I can try the Hello Kitty and Harajuku Lover specialty drinks! Both look delicious.  Not the most amazing sushi and appetizers, but definitely not bad considering the price. And for me during happy hour anyway, its really more about the company and drinks than the food. Happy Happy Hour Hopping!"
5,"This is one of my favorite little gems in Phoenix. Ive never had better pho than here. I usually order the ""spicy beef sate"" pho, which is miles above the rare beef pho. My family and I also order the pork ""spicy treats"" which is a roll-your-own spring roll. Its delicious and fun! One order feeds all five of us.  The owner is also extremely nice. They also offer discounts to ASU students! Have to love that."
5,Man the chompie sliders is the bomb.  Wish there were some in LA.  Man taste so good and flavor.
5,"What a great surprise stumbling across this bank!  Open 7 days a week with lobby service I have banked with the Mega Uber Banks and have been nickeled and dimed (literally) with service fees. I opened both a savings and checking account here.  Since my company does not offer direct deposit the associate told me I would have to have a traditional checking account with service fees.  Im thinking - here we go again.  But it was one of those think on your feet moments.  Off they went (Ill assume to get approval).   They let me open up a type of checking account that only charges you for check printing - No other fees and pays interest.  In fact, if you use a non-MidFirst Bank ATM, they will refund you the service fees.  How refreshing with the current state of banking."
5,"After four years of living in AZ I finally found Mexican food that appeals to me and my husband. Lets just say they changed my husbands view on tacos. He never swayed from eating vegetarian burritos until he got a hold of their carne asada tacos. In the last 4 months we lived in AZ we went there almost every week and brought friends, whom now cant get enough of them too. They are reasonably priced, have great customer service and everything we have eaten so far has been fabulous. If you are looking for great food and youre not concerned with being in a fine dining Mexican restaurant, then look no further.  We miss you Los Taquitos....."
5,"I have never had BBQ in the South, Texas, or anywhere outside of California (except Bobby Q), but of all the places Ive tried, Bobby Q is my current favorite BBQ place EVER!  I found this place on Yelp and came here while on a trip to Arizona.  The place was pretty crowded but we only  waited about 15-20 minutes.  We ordered babyback ribs, St. Louis ribs, corn, and mac&cheese.  They also give you DELICIOUS AMAZING CORNBREAD! Everything was excellent.  The St. Louis ribs were the best ribs I have ever had.  They were extremely tender and had a nice flavorful bark on the  outside with dark grill marks.  Their BBQ sauce was equally awesome and the kind I like -- a bit more on the sweeter side, less on the vinegary side.  The babyback ribs were also tasty, but not as flavorful (and less meat of course) than the St. Louis ones.  The sides were good but more forgettable due to the sheer perfection of their ribs. I dont know if I will ever be in Phoenix again, but this place is a must-return if I ever am.  Oh and at the end of the meal, they gave us complimentary, piping hot FRESH cinnamon donuts!  That double-won me over.  I want Bobby Q right now."
1,"Fake (or rather condescending) service from the ""Service Manager""...and he didnt even acknowledge me when I asked the status of my car (uh, more like IGNORE). Ended every sentence with an impolite ""No maam"" or ""Yes, maam""... ya get the scenario. Basically, the guy was a real JERK. They couldnt even figure out HOW to fix my car, even when I TOLD them what was wrong with it ( had been diagnosed at the Dealership). Two guys were sitting there staring at the computer (as if it was going to magically speak to them). At least they didnt charge me, but what a waste of time waiting for 90 minutes...."
5,Tasty Thai- is. But it could also be called Delicious Thai. And the service is always great!
5,i go to debon every 3 weeks for aki the hairdresser.  shes very nice and asks you a lot of quesitons to make sure you get what you want.  she is reasonably priced.
5,"If you are looking for only raw vegan food, this is your place.  Nothing is cooked, everyhthing is 100% raw.  They offer a variety of creative options from appetizers, wraps, soups, pizza and pasta.  They have freshly squeezed juices, smoothies and a variety of different health shots.  The dessert is yummy as well.  This is a must try!"
5,OMG this place is good. Great Italian beef. Great burgers. FRY SAUCE. I dont know how theyre pulling off such good food with what they have but its awesome and I will be eating here if Im in the area and hungry.
4,"Ive always sorta had mixed feelings about this theater. On the one hand, there arent a whole lot of options to see independent film in AZ besides this place and Camelview, so Ive got thank Dan Harkins for those outlets. On the other hand, there are times when this theater plays the SAME movie for weeks. An examples of this was with What The Bleep Do We Know?. I hate it when this place does that, but its nice to see films here that wouldnt normally get play at Camelview (ie. Che: Parts 1 & 2, Let The Right One In, etc.). In all, this place is a bit like my own Cinema Paradiso because I have so many fond memories in this theater. There was a Pulp Fiction screening when I was in high school and I got to go to an advanced screening of Slumdog Millionaire and actually got to meet Danny Boyle when he showed up for a Q&A afterward. I just wish they had midnight screenings of classic/grindhouse/cult films like The New Beverly in LA."
2,"As far as teppanyaki restaurants go this one isnt top of my favorites. 2 stars for good service and a nice setting... Im docking 3 stars for my food being over cooked and not being offered anything to replace it, and our chef not doing any sort of classic teppanyaki cooking tricks (making oil light on fire, flipping shrip at people, bouncing his utensils around.. ect). Decent place to eat, but not a value for what you pay for."
1,"when i worked in retail my paycheck was spent before i got paid. therefore, i relied heavily on coupons and splitting meals w all of my other poor college friends. well, i hit the jackpot. $15 coupon for a FEAST. the picture on the coupon showed everything we would get: a huge steak, shrimp, and lobster PLUS 2 sides. there were 3 of us- this was PLENTY.  it was prom night too so we were initally fooled with how popular it was. popular for prom girls with light up clear shoes (not even lying), if that says anything about the crowd for you... our waitress stops by our booth and just stares at us. one of my friend kinda looks around at me and our other friend, then back at the waitress. ill have a diet coke? then our waitress writes it down and doesnt say anything but looks at my other friend. i lost it and started laughing. why isnt she talking to us? this is so weird.  we ended up asking for a different waitress, then found out the coupon was a big fat liar. you didnt get all of that. it just says you do but you dont. the food ended up being nasty. probably one of the worst meals ive ever had.  as were leaving susy talks a lot waitress trips over my friend and it was all too awkward bc i couldnt control laughing.  awful food, awful service, AND the bathrooms were some of the grossest i had ever been in.  if wal-mart ran a restaurant, this would be it."
2,"My wife and I were downtown with some friends, and decided to check this place out. I ordered a pasta lunch, and chose Penne Alla Campagna and another penne with tomatoes and Mozzarella. Meh, it was just okay. The food was just okay, kind of bland and a bit overpriced. I did snag a small slice of pepperoni pizza from one of the kids at our table that was actually the best part of my meal. Would I go back, nope no sir"
2,"I have been a long time customer at this car wash with this location. I have been going there since it Changed from Weiss Guys to Diamond Car wash and now its known as Francis and Sons. It seems the service has declined for each change of ownership.   Today was the tip of the iceberg and I will not be going there again. The past 2 visits have proven to me that their customer service has rapidly declined.   I understand that every business needs to ""Upsell"", but it becomes an annoyance when they keep bugging me 5,6,7,8 times after I have said no. Dont even get me started on their glass repair salesmen.... I always get the Premium auto wash, a few weeks ago I went and when I got home I noticed they had not cleaned my dash or center console (which is included in premium). I also noticed they had not wiped down my tires after applying Armor All and it all splattered up to the sides of my vehicle after driving away, I wrote these off as a simple mistake and that it probably would not happen again.   Todays experience was worse. I took my truck in for a wash and I told the guy I did not have time for a hand wax (upsell) I was then pressured into buying it in advance so I could come back another day and get it waxed. No was not an answer to this guy, I had to actually walk away to leave this Pressured UPSELL.   Again, I purchased the premium wash. They called for the vehicle and I noticed that there were little black spots (mud?) all over the side of the truck. I told the guy about this and he said ""its ready."" I explained that it wasnt and started using my finger to poke at what was probably 20-30 little black spots all over the side, he gave me a disgusted look and told me he had to go get a clean rag. I asked for a manager.   The manager came and had the guy wipe the spots off, but did not seem to care at all and walked away before the guy wiped down half of the spots. I had already given a tip to the first guy and this guy stood there expecting a tip, I am generous with tips, but will not tip more because I had to ask them to fix their mistake.   Upon entry of my vehicle I noticed there was still some dirt on the floor and my center console armrest was not cleaned. I only took the truck in due to my dog leaving paw prints on the center armrest and hair all over the place...   I got an oil change at Dannys Car Wash at Tempe Marketplace a few weeks ago, and was so Impressed by their service and car wash service that I will make the 20 minute trip to go up there for my car wash from now on."
4,This is a great place to take your time and enjoy someones company. The food is fresh and the service always friendly. If you are looking to be fed fast this is not the place to go. Fondue is fun! If you have the time and the money this is a place to have a great evening.
5,"I had to do some painting and needed help locating items and suggestions from the staff and boy were they ever helpful.  Nothing like Home Depot, where you have to go and hunt down an employee and when you do they cant wait to get back to their break or whatever was more important than their customer.  I was just overwhelmed by the courteous and quick service I received at this location.  Even their quality of garden plants surpassed several other super stores."
4,They have Veggie Dogs! The veggie dog will run you about 40 calories fewer than the regular turkey dog. Happy eating :)
4,"Games- great. Game prices- decent. Food- Edible, but nothing to write home about. Food prices- WAY too high for the quality. Bar- Weird. The 1st bar Ive heard of that doesnt carry Baileys or some type of Irish cream liqueur. Drinks- Meh, stick w/ beer. Service- Also weird. Ive had the best service here when its crazy busy and the absolute worst when my friends and I are the only people to be waited on. A good time, if youre going for games and basic drinks."
3,"It is absolutely no fun to have a connection at this airport! It was definitely  not designed to be ""post-911"" friendly. Let me give you an example so that you will know what I mean:  We fly in from San Francisco and are told that we will have to go to another building via a bus. We get off the plane and walk...and walk...and then walk some more, looking around trying to find where to go to in order to catch this bus. Finally, we found someone who told us where to go. We walked and walked, and then walked some more until we finally caught the bus. We then had to find the correct gate and go through security again...  Flash forward 8 days. We fly in and go through customs. (This, BTW, was a great experience because we were the only international flight going through customs.) We rechecked our luggage and are told that we have to go to another building. Yep, you know what I am about to say...we floundered around, having to ask where to go several times. Finally, we found the right place and got on the bus. It then proceeded to go to various parking lots, dropping off and picking up other passengers. My husband and I looked at each other, worried that we were on the wrong bus. Since it was already 4 p.m. and we had not had lunch, we were getting very worried that we would not have time to grab lunch.  Finally, my husband asked the driver and he indicated that we were indeed on the right bus. We continued going around parking lots until we came upon another bus. The driver told everyone on our bus that we could sit around and wait for 10-15 minutes, or we could get on the next bus and get there quicker. Of course, we all grabbed our suitcases and boarded the next bus, which proceeded to take us to the correct stop (after picking up additional passengers along the way.)  Next ,we entered the terminal and jumped on an elevator to take us to the security line. There were only 2 lines and of course, we got in the line with the family who had to go back 6 or 7 times because they kept trying to go through the security line with belts on, shoes on, liquids in  their suitcases...you get the picture!  Anyway, we finally got to our gate and were able to grab a slice of pizza before boarding our plane (not before enduring the antics of a 70-year-old United Airlines power-hungry granny who couldnt seem to get her act together, but was determined to show everyone who was boss...)"
4,"tried this place due to a restaurant.com gift certificate, 4 stars for service, we had an awesome and attentive server which made it great for first visit. drinks were good. went with friends and did some sharing to try the different dishes we ordered. the salmon quesadillas was on the fishy side, the pollo relleno good but a little dry and didnt get the poblano and goat cheese flavors that drew me to choosing the dish, the cilantro mousse sounded more interesting on the menu but was cream cheese and cilantro, the Obama burrito was the winner on our table though. great salsa. would come back and try other dishes and tae in some live music."
4,"We went to Ocean Prime the other night and it was delicious.  I dont know if it was worth the money but it was definitely good.  The setting is as attractive as any restaurant I can remember, with classical contemporary decor and a very cool display of alcohol bottles in the bar. I was in a party of seven and the prevalent dish was the bone-in filet.  We had heard it was better than the steakhouses in Chicago.  Well Im from Chicago, and trust me, you get a better (and bigger) bone-in filet at Joes.  But it was still a delicious steak.  The sides were terrific and the salads were good too.  But those prices!  Wow, value is not this restaurants strong suit. About the only other thing Ill add is the service was below average, a concern considering what the prices were like.  Our server tried hard but he was too slow and didnt get our order right."
5,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this office!  During my high-risk pregnancy I spent a lot of time at this office and in the hospital.  Both Dr. Hahn and Dr. Spieker were fantastic, very knowledgable and easy to talk to.  I trust them completly as they did everything to ensure both myself and my baby were well taken care of.   I have since seen Dr. Cyr for a quick appointment whom is very sweet."
4,"Tandoori Times Volume 1, Issue 1, Number 1.  Limited run.  Copyright 2009, Mejimbo Enterprises.  All Rights Reserved.   Dateline 7 May 2009 Scottsdale, Arizona     Yelpers Jim W and Audrey W were reportedly seen enjoying lively conversation and delicious Indian food with Donald S and Carin S.  Witnesses claim the group was laughing loudly at times.  One bystander reported, ""That was a guffaw.  That outburst right there was definitely a guffaw.  Wild stuff.""     Sources have related to this publication that the group dined on two appetizers, one known as a bread basket which consisted of four types of naan bread.  Jim W was overheard to say, ""I really like the onion naan.""  The other appetizer may have been Aloo Tikki.  This has not been confirmed as yet.  In any case the plate containing the reported Aloo Tikki was cleaned by the foursome, several even going so far as to swab at the remaining sauce on the plate.     The above sources also reported that the table was served an order of the Friday daily special of Kahari Shrimp.  It was overheard by a nearby table that the shrimp was ""...flavorful with strong notes of garlic and ginger.""  This has not substantiated, however.     Audrey W reportedly was served the Lamb Korma which she was rumored to have noted was ""Yummy.""     Carin S apparently was served the Chicken Masala and Donald S may have been served some sort of Vindaloo that included potato.  It seems there was considerable sharing of the dishes around the table and the main dishes may have been spooned over what some experts have suggested was a basmati rice with various herbs and spices.     An unnamed source has informed this publication that while Jim W claims to have particularly enjoyed the food and festive atmosphere which included a belly dancer and some swordplay, he was displeased with the excessive sound level produced by the in-house sound system and even requested that the music be reduced.     Jim Ws blog had a statement this morning that read, in part; ""...ears havent hurt the next morning like that since my last rock concert.  I really liked the food but I wouldnt go back on a night when they have dancing again."""
3,"This Dunkin Donuts is hit or miss. When i run in here for just coffee, the service is usually very fast and prompt. When i run in there to order coffee and food, that usually becomes a circus. There have been times when ive waited over 20 minutes for my food. Usually its not a problem, but when you have a business meeting that you have to attend to, it is.  Fast food, pffft. Bring a sleeping bag."
5,"Im not a fan of ice cream, I just dont find it appealing and its too high in calories/saturated fat. However I do love frozen yogurt, and ironically its much less fattening, yet more satisfying. At 25 calories an ounce, Golden Spoons is the best around. There have a large array of flavors to choose from and they rotate flavors each month, they also have seasonal flavors such as pumpkin pie and egg nog. You also can get more than one flavor combined. They also have a wide variety of toppings to choose from, from gummy bears to low-fat brownies. Even though their yogurt is non-fat and low calorie, adding toppings can quickly add a lot more calories, I suggest going with chocolate or rainbow sprinkles (adds less than 50 calories), or if you like fruit, go with that."
1,"the owner was dishonest, she posted a menu outside with lower pricing to attarct traffic, and then charge higher pricing menu inside. she also charge me 12% sales tax, which is illegal in tempe, which suppose to be only 9.3% very rude manner, not recommended"
5,Good JIB. Fast an friendly.
1,"From my door, its a five minute stroll through the greenbelt to Dukes. They have a nice patio. They have enough TVs to show all MLB/NFL/NBA games. They have plenty of shuffleboard and pool tables. Yet, Ive only been to Dukes a few times and I am not going back. This place is just bad. Mixed drinks are poured short and use cheap mixers (such as bottled sour mix for margaritas). They offer a pretty basic beer selection. I think PBR pitchers might be more modestly priced, but that might be only when theyre on ""special."" The food is pretty bad, even for bar food. And pricey. Sure, the menu is gigantic and Ive tried many different items, but I didnt find anything good. Everything seems to be made from ""freezer to fryer"" or packaged products. Im not exaggerating: the burger and fries for about $8 is a thin, previously frozen patty with a handful or supermarket fries. I could go on about salads, sandwiches, and ribs. In the same price range, you can get a much better version of anything on the menu at Four Peaks or Zipps or even Devils Advocate. One of the owners was there on a few occasions. I guess being the boss of (and drinking in) his own bar is some sort of dream of his. He treats the place like his kingdom. Hell ask patrons ""how is everything?"" and get mad at them if they have anything negative to say. I feel bad for the rest of the service staff; they seem to be above average, but when the overall situation is this bad it just doesnt matter. In this city, sports bars are a dime a dozen. Id rather go elsewhere."
2,"I thought I was really in for one of the best burgers of my life due to my fellow Yelpers reviews but was sort of disappointed.  I did like the fries in the shopping cart, that was pretty creative, but they werent anything special.  Same way I felt about the Delux burger.  The meat was dry and the condiments were lacking which made it worse.  I thiknk the bun was the best part.  I did do a cool beer flight which was nice.  The atmosphere is pretty neat here but I probably wont visit again if Im in the area."
4,"Great Bellini, loved the Seared Ahi, Portabella and Beef Tenderloin Flatbread and Spinach and Artichoke dip! I highly recommend you select the same on happy hour! 3-6pm 7 days a week!"
4,Great Thai and Chinese food. Friendly family staff. We were served by their very cool 11year old son. Kind of place you want to support. Food was excellent and very reasonable. Go for the curry-
5,"My favorite Mexican food.  THE BEST BEAN BURRO ENCHILADA STYLE IN THE WORLD (yes Ive tried them all)  Get the red enchilada sauce, and a tortilla on the side."
4,"Kids eat free on Wed and now also Sundays with specific adult purchase!  The white pizzas are fantastic!! mmmmmm. The kids get slices (as a kids meal) and the cheese ones are good, too. The seasonal salads have been wonderful--current one I think is called Strawberry Fields? it has nice greens, almond slices, strawberries, apples, cheese, and 2 different dressings.  Got the calzone last night--not recommended. The large (I ordered a small and she made a mistake) was HUGE---large enough for about 5 or 6 people, unless everyone has a huge appetite for a lotta carbs. The dough was uncooked on the inside, and the broccoli and chicken were cold :(.  I guess that process needs some work. At this particular location, theres always a gal that greets us and keeps calling us ""guys"" in every sentence. Its just a little weird, but the rest of the staff is great.  Again with this place, like at China King, never sure why there doesnt seem to be many people eating in. They do deliver, so maybe lots of ppl have delivery? They do have patio seating with misters, but right now, kinda hot to eat outside. Probably lovely in the cooler weather. Kids meals come with a small sundae, so that makes them happy.   The fountain drinks are Pepsi. The diet pepsi tastes bad, and the diet dr pepper doesnt taste much better. They do, however, have filtered water. Your choice of filtered NYC water (tastes great!) or filtered Chandler water. BTW this location is in the same plaza where Outback, Nordstrom Rack, Famous Footwear, SAS, etc are, so the parking is a little cramped. Not much NYPD can do about that, but its annoying."
4,"Ive been here twice and my favorite item has been their version of tiramisu. Its not soaked in espresso or whatever the local italian eateries are using these days..its made with champagne! Its light and fluffy..its like eating a cloud from heaven. Very much a date place.. It has a ""romantic"" atmosphere so dont go there if youre not trying to give off that vibe. Otherwise great for a group setting..... Oh and for any potential cougars the waitstaff is delicious eye candy. ;)"
4,"I love this place!  Authentic mexican food at inexpensive prices.  Friendly and attentive staff.  The cleanest Filibertos I have seen.  I visit at least once a week during the lunch hour.  The Chile Rellenos are awesome, lightly battered, lots of spicy sauce... just simply delicious.  Taco Tuesdays (99 cent tacos) are a great bargain.  Complimentary salsa bar with multiple hot sauce type salsas, sliced cucumbers, and a fantastic spicy carrot/onion/jalapeno/chile salad... all free.  My only complaint is the salsa bar, soda fountains and cashier area, which are all located up front, can get very congested... I wish they could rearrange that somehow.  Oh, plus it would be nice to offer a chunky (pico de gallo) type salsa on the salsa bar, similar to Baja Fresh.  Check out the website for coupons - great deals!  You also will receive a bright orange (cant miss it) set of coupons with each purchase, to use on your next visit.  Im a fan!"
3,"It was a little expensive.  $65.80 for two apps, one drink, two sodas, two entrees, and one shared dessert. Highlights: The Grilled Wings were very good.   Nice and crisp, charred but not burned, and not too fatty.  I could have eaten two dozen of them. The Cheddar Potatoes were a hit at the table, liked by all. The Creme Brulee was excellent, and about twice the size that Torched Goodness offers, for 5 cents less than TG charges. Lowlights: The hummus was just plain, and there was something else they put on top of it, something a little bitter - ??  Not sure what it was, but it was not impressive. The ""half rack"" of ribs were pretty tiny for $14.95.  Not a lot of meat. The Flatiron Steak was also tiny, and overcooked.  Not very tasty at all. Mashed potatoes and Mac-N-Cheese were very pedestrian. All in all, I might go back, have 2 orders of the wings app, and finish with Creme Brulee.  But I wont go with the kids again, not for $75 with tip.  We could have eaten 3 times at Los Taquitos for that price."
4,"This review is for the bar ONLY!  First time I came in here it was packed to this gills, and no where to sit so we left.. Next! Second time I came here I met 2 of the strangest old women Ive ever encountered who tried to reel me into a marketing scam, wouldnt shut up about how lovely I was and how both of them wanted me as their daughter, then performed Reiki on me and my friend, waving their hands all around us eyes closed and chanting.. in front of the everyone. I couldnt help but bust out in laughter. Bartender laughed too, then poured more bourbon in my glass and winked. I really liked this place aside from the geriatric nonsense. Great vibe & I loved the entrance, you walk right through the kitchen and can observe the chefs working their magic. The interior is dark and sexy, with some of the coolest wallpaper Ive ever seen. I am hoping to write an update soon, because I desperately want to try the steak that I have heard so much about, but $60 for dinner is a little out of my budget, thanks to our economical crisis and being unemployed. *sigh*"
4,"The first thing to know about this Los Reyes location is that it is quite different from the one on 7th St!  Its a different menu here, for starters!  I had my heart set on my usual, a ""Torta Norteña, & a 99 cent Ceviché.  They dont have those things here, so I settled for the nearest looking sandwich, a ""Mexican Torta"".  (My server did say the ownership is the same as the Sunnyslope location.)  Anyhow, heres how it was for me here today: *  This is a good sized place, & I managed to find both a parking space & a comfortable table inside to land at, even though they were ROARING BUSY! *  My nice server almost immediately brought me a big basket of tortilla chips & two kinds of salsa, medium & hot!  Both were good.  (They dont even serve tortilla chips at Sunnyslope.) *  I ordered, & it took a little while for my sandwich to arrive, but as I said, they were super busy!  No problemo.  Meanwhile, I ate about half of my chips, & Señorita brought me ANOTHER big basket of them, & more salsa! *  My torta arrived, & it was BIG & DELICIOUS!  It comes with a side salad, which included some pimento & cucumber slices, lime halves, lettuce, & a fried quarter onion.  All this was good too (&  DID remind me of the other location). *  Gripes?  THREE TVs blabbing out a show in Spanish, fairly loud, & this place was noisy to begin with. SO?  ...I didnt care as much for the menu here as Sunnyslope, & the TVs were a bit of a nuisance, but with that said, I still think this is an very good place to eat, & the value was AMAZING at only $6.50 for everything!     :-))"
1,"I had such a nice experience here - Classic Chicken - the first time that I really wanted to go back. Second time, onion strings were so greasy I couldnt eat them, burger was okay. Third time, yesterday? Enough to say we wont go back. Ever.  Lovely and I sat in a sticky booth, he ordered 1/3 lb classic, me the bbq grilled chicken - both with a small soda. Soda was disgusting, flat, watery, gross. Upon the lovelys complaint, the bus boy brought him bottled water. I took one bite of my sandwich and was assaulted by hair. Gak. We got up and left our food. Jeff told the manager about the food and the soda, we got our money back with an apology saying they were sorry we didnt have a better experience. Um. A better experience??? Seriously? 15 dollars?  Ugh."
5,I love this place. Just to hang out on a Summer day on the patio and have a beer is like...the perfect day.  The food is awesome. The Kilt Lifter is tasty and thirst quenching.  The area is definitely lucky to have such a place.
5,"When I moved away, these were the tacos that I missed!  I stopped back today, and must say - it was exactly how I remembered!  The lunch specials are very reasonably priced at $5.99 and come with two items and rice and beans. I always get the hard taco - seasoned shredded beef, lettuce, and cheese in a deep fried corn tortilla - and the cheese enchilada. I could eat the rice and beans alone, both are so well seasoned and they definitely dont skimp on the cheese! The only thing to watch is that the red hot sauce can vary from visit to visit - some days its super hot, others - not so much. The wait staff is exceptionally friendly and always try to help me because my Spanish is so limited. The interior is large but very modest, there arent a lot of fancy decorations - this is a place to come for the food and service and  not th ambiance.  Still, one of my faves!"
4,Sakana is one of my two favorite neighborhood sushi joints. I love their calamari salad (although the one at this location is considerably smaller than the one on 59th ave) and agedashi tofu. The waitstaff is friendly and their bday song is always fun!  Insiders tip: ask for some real wasabi!
4,"Coming from a place and age where the most exotic ethnic food was considered to be Taco Time, I have spent  many years experimenting with all kinds of different foods.  One of my favorites is Indian food, and thanks to Microsoft and other tech companies, who use workers from India,  there are many more Indian restaurants now scattered throughout the country.  I am not an expert on the food (in fact, until recently, I never understood why Bollywood movies were always playing in Indian restaurants).  But I do enjoy it, and try every Indian restaurant I can find. I started going to Indian Paradise several years ago, and loved it.  It has a nice interior, and the servers are very nice and helpful.  I always seem to come in the early evening, before they are busy, and I always feel somewhat spoiled the way they treat me.  I love their masalas, curry, and naan, and have, of course, tried all of their Indian beers. I also find the different tandoori dishes delicious. I might note that I have never made it to the lunch buffet - I always seem to be golfing at that time so Im just never in the area .  But it is on my list of things to do. ***Bollywood - Bollywood is the name given to the Mumbai-based Hindi-language film industry in India.The term Bollywood was created by conflating Bombay (the city now called Mumbai) and Hollywood. Bollywood films are usually musicals. Few movies are made without at least one song-and-dance number. Indian audiences expect full value for their money; they want songs and dances, love interest, comedy and dare-devil thrills, all mixed up in a three hour long extravaganza with intermission."
2,Tried this place multiple times.  Many different items.  The only thing Worth remembering were the margaritas and the had pretty good service.
4,"Came in for my birthday burger, and decided on the garden-burger.  I hadnt tried it before, but Ill be trying it again, many more times.  I may even go vegetarian now that this baby is in my dietetic arsenal.  Love it!"
3,"3 Stars only because the house margarita and guacamole was so good.  The food was decent (fish tacos), however the patio atmosphere was a bit sad. I understand this is more of a bar than a fine dining restaurant but the patio tables had no place settings, condiments, etc... Just cheap metal tables and chairs. Also - there was no music out there, just this incessant humming of a back alley generator.   The service was a bit sporadic out on the patio as well. We were asked by three different servers if we have a server yet. Not much in the way of organization.  Maybe management just hasnt gotten around to fully organizing and furnishing the patio yet. I hope they do, because they are in a great location and the food and drinks give them lots of potential."
5,"Rarely give a 5, but truthfully? We set out to go to Giuseppes and stopped here...thought we were there...Im sure Giu. is good, but Arrivederci is the bomb. We will keep going on every visit. Reasonable and really, really authentic. Bueno Sera is your welcome..and they mean it! We loved it. . . reasonable, too. b"
5,"I love the Madagascar coconut white tea! The prices and very reasonable, only downfall for me is they dont list the caffeine content;("
5,"My friend has raved about this place for months, so for her birthday the girls and I got together for a little pizza field trip to LGO. It was amazing! Just as good as Mozza Pizzeria in LA., but around 400 miles closer. I also love the little grocery store. Very cute things to buy."
4,"The chicken shawarma is stellar. I get it to go at least once a month, substituting veggies for the rice. Slightly pricey, but you get a lot of food and its very consistent."
1,"I wouldnt write a review on a franchise unless it pissed me off. I prefer Papa Johns pizza to Dominos or Pizza Hut (by far), but there are some major service issues that have made my five ordering experiences pretty irritating. They cant find my house. Its not hard to find, I swear. Its a piece of cake, and a stones throw from a major crossroad. They had once taken two hours to deliver a pizza, saying they tried to call me (they didnt), only to return to the store and bring it back once I called. Naturally, I was delivered a lukewarm pizza, but in the nicest way possible was told that it was *my* mistake.  Unacceptable, in the age of online ordering and GPS systems in our phones, there is no excuse for getting lost in what is essentially a three mile drive in a straight line.  Without complaining, I had received a coupon for a free large pizza. Apology accepted. Upon visiting the store, I got to keep the card *after* ordering because they gave me the wrong toppings. Suckers. Also, they always take longer than the ETA, even in the middle of a weekday. Even now, I am waiting 70 minutes for a 30-40 minute order, and when I had called 15 minutes ago, was told it was on its way, but that construction was holding it up. Yes, there is construction, but you have taken this long in the past without it. Also, construction would not explain why it takes nearly an hour to produce one large pizza. I even tip nicely. I enjoy Papa Johns pizza, but unless my complaints are addressed, I will never order from this location again. I will encourage my friends to follow suit. RAWR."
3,"Hulas seems pretty hyped. I had drinks here that were OK. I had food here that was OK. Ill try it again and get an entree, but Ill not likely go out of my way to make it here."
2,"Sorry.  Im from Southern California so Im used to great Mexican food.  We were excited to try this restaurant, since we had read some great things about it.  However, the waiter was pompous and the food was mediocre.  We were in a party of four and we all ordered different meals.  The guacamole that was made from one avocado was $11.  The restaurant is in a scary location.  We had to park in a back alley.  It was agreed that the experience was a bust.  If youre in the area and want great food, go to Lons at the Hermosa, Elements at Sanctuary or True Food Kitchen."
4,"My husband & I have been going to one Zipps or another around town for the last 7 years...we currently live near the Old Town location...always our go to place to eat during the week when we dont feel like fixing dinner at home. Its your typical sports bar with a bit better food selection. You cant find a big 32oz beer for $4 ($3.50 @ happy hour) anywhere around town & their onion rings are outstanding, you can order 1/2 & 1/2 ...fries & onion rings with your burger or sandwich. We have never had an issue with the wait staff at any of the 3 different locations we have visited. The new boneless buffalo chicken skewers are fabulous & on special when regular wings are.  Happy Hour M-F 3-7pm $5 Wings & other stuff  Plus nightly specials 8pm-close & Weekend specials 11a-4p We love Zipps!!"
4,"5/7/12... I have to make a correction to my review as I received communication from someone with the club..  I was informed that they are not like other clubs as they have a ""Two Item"" minimum, not a two drink minimum.   So you can order a food dish and a drink to meet that minimum.  And I did confirm that one in our group ordered a bottled water which counted toward his minimum. So I stand corrected."
4,"The Breakfast Club is as good as youll find. The blueberry pancakes are superb, their coffee is beyond description. For a change of pace, try their Eggs Benedict, Southwestern style. A GREAT spot within walking distance...a beauty."
4,"Some amazing friends of mine surprised me and set up a whole birthday dinner at Jug n Barrel! This was my first time here and was shocked at how cute the place was. Even in a strip mall it actually had a fireplace which gave it a very cozy feel. The wine list is great and not too intimidating. We had a great server who even put together a wine flight to match my sweet tooth. The only thing that knocks a star (More like 1.5 stars) off the rating is the completely average food. We had a group of about 12 and ordered several appetizers and all of us ordered entrees. I dont think any of us were blown away by our meals.  Although I will not return for a meal, I would return for wine with friends."
5,"Im not gonna lie, I possibly had the best sunny side up eggs ever.  A simple dish so rarely cooked perfectly."
2,"Its was just OK! Liked the fresh jalapenos option, fries hardly had seasoning, was a bit pricey, but filling.  Free peanuts, but wasnt sure if it was ok to throw on the floor. They use the same color scheme as In N Out which I thought was humerous.  Ill still give it another try in a few months."
4,"We arrived at US Egg on St. Patricks Day at 10:00 am before the As vs. Giants Spring Training game and only had a wait of 15 minutes. Not bad to start! Promptly seated we were brought a pitcher of water and ordered our breakfast. The Denver Scramble is delicious! My husband ordered the Hash & eggs - reasonably priced, quick service and a ton of food to start your long days off right!"
4,"2 for 1 drinks at night, awesome homemade veggie burger & by far some of the BEST salad dressings Ive ever had. Shrimp & fruit salad with the champagne dressing was amazing. Their house dressing is just as good. By far my fave meal is now brunch. I ordered the ""best egg white omelet youve ever had"" & I must agree! The omelet was huge and packed full of awesomeness and flavor. The drinks were only $3 a glass. Peach Bellinis, bloodies, G-Spot, mimosas! I am hooked to brunch. They also serve late night, until 12am! FEZ Im such a fan!"
4,"I had never heard of this place until some friends from out of town brought us a bottle of the olive oil. So when I had out of town company visiting, we made a trip to the Olive Mill and signed up for the tour.  The tour is not really much of a tour, but more of a 20-25 minute lesson on growing and harvesting olives, and then a look at the equipment used to press the oil. Our tour guide was very entertaining and funny. While there was a long period of standing, there is very little walking so really anyone can get their $5 worth. While waiting for the tour to start, we wandered around the store and then enjoyed the wine and cider tasting outside. They also have live music every Saturday.  After the tour we filled several sample cups with a variety of olive oil flavors, and bought a loaf of bread, and enjoyed figuring out what was in each cup. The line to order food was too long, so we didnt stick around for a meal, but everything looked wonderful.  The only less than positive thing I have to say is that they really promoted the Pork Shop down the road, so we went there hoping to load up on ready made food (since we had opted not to wait in line for Olive Mill food). Its actually a butcher shop that also sells a few cooked items. There were BBQ pork burritos, green chili burritos, and spare ribs. The pork burrito was alright, but the sauce overwhelmed the meat so thats all you could really taste.  The ribs were really a disappointment. They are around $6-7 a pound, and although they were meaty, it took way too much work to get the meat off of the bones. Perhaps a few more hours in the oven, and they would have been better - but I dont recommend going out of your way to check this place out."
5,"I am basing this review solely on the Cauliflower Soup. Holy Heaven in a cup. We had Zupas cater lunch at the office, so I cant speak to the actual restaurant. But man, I wish I had a bucket of that soup."
3,"Their food isnt bad, its pretty hard to mess up gyros, rice, salad, and fries.  When it comes to this type of food it really comes down to preference.  For me, I didnt care for this place.  I like crispy fries, their fries are soggy.  I like Beef & Lamb gyros, theirs are Beef only.  I like a mixed green salad with light onion, they serve a shredded romaine salad with heavy onion.  Their prices are fair, portions large, and service friendly, its just not for me.  They did have a lot of sandwiches and burgers that looked good, if thats your thing."
5,"Only 4 stars?  (A few notes: The folks that rated this place low must have been isolated incidences and I feel weigh far to heavy on service rather than product. Dining at a restaurant, rate the service a lil harder, but a coffee shop, hold your tongue.) Anyway, this place rocks. We arent super close, but we pass up several coffee shops en route to Lola because the quality is top drawer. The beans, fair trade, and the roast is perfect. The price of a bag of beans is amazing. Doing right by the farmers and then respecting the product with such a solid roast. This is what is all about! I have yet to find a better americano. A splash of cream and a splenda only augments the flavor of the espresso and the richness really shines. Ive been to most of the independent coffee shops throughout the area, and if I do find myself elsewhere, I can only compare them to Lola, and Lola wins out each time."
4,"To quote my boyfriend, we like this place because ""theyre solid."" Every time we order here, the food is great and fresh. I always get their sweet and sour chicken and I am never disappointed. Instead of chicken chunks coated in batter, this place uses a chicken breast with batter that I would describe to be a thin tempura like batter. There is no excess batter or fat chunks to deal with it. The service is fast and we see the same waiter every time we eat here. This is the my go to place for Chinese food."
4,"Brio is delish, plain and simple. I have yet to get something that isnt tasty. I live about 15-20 miles from one so I dont get out there too often but I do wish there was one closer to my area."
4,Excellent cheap Mexican food that tastes as good as any Mexican restaurant.
1,"After several hundred professional massages over the past 20 years, I encountered today a first -- a massage therapist who explained that she could not do a massage involving any but mild pressure using her hands. It was an issue of ""protecting the thumbs."" When I told her I didnt like forearms and elbows, she explained that shed never worked without using her forearms (and, I assume, her elbows, too). After just five minutes, when I asked for more pressure, she suggested we stop the massage -- that she wasnt the ""therapist for [me]."" She was right. What are they teaching these people these days, and why doesnt an excellent outfit like LifeTime Fitness insist on better skills among its massage staff? I wont offer her name, but, if considering a massage at this establishment, I suggest Casie as the only therapist here worth the money."
4,"This is about as good as it gets for Asian food in this price range.  The chicken isnt chewy like many other inexpensive Asian restaurants.  Ive had several of their dishes and without a doubt the Yakisoba with chicken is my favorite.  I love the white-meat chicken and broccoli (with Teriyaki sauce).  The broccoli is quality, and never overcooked.  And I love their Teriyaki sauce."
5,"Owner Daniel M. is one of my most favorite restaurateurs in Phoenix. His stamina and passion for the business of serving fine cuisine is a rare find. Daniel is from South America but you wouldnt know it; his knowledge of the secret kitchens of Tuscany, Umbria and Amalfi is uncanny. I know this because I traveled with him and his chef one year on their odyssey through Italy. Daniel takes special pride in personally choosing a very select few bottles of wine to fit any budget. OK, its not Etiennes Different Point of Views list of 4000, but know that any choice you make is going to be a good one. If youre not sure, just ask for Daniel and tell him what you have in mind -- likely he has (with a wink) a special bottle in the back. When we traveled through the Italian countryside I was constantly astonished by the warm greetings and special invitations we had from local proprietors who shared with us exquisite homemade wines and dishes made with pride from the finest vegetables and livestock. We frequently stayed long past closing with the owners and into the night sampling rare port and grappa. At one restaurant in Orvieto the owner took us deep into the dank recesses of the wine cellar for a special sampling  of cheese and wine. Talk about knowing people? One afternoon while drinking our 5th bottle of wine, who walks by but Jan DAtri! Wow. (Thats another review.) And speaking of reviewers, I also ran into Phoenix Magazines Nikki Buchanan (also extremely nice). When Daniel first opened in this location with that little stone oven in the corner, it was a pizzeria and guests could belly up to long tables in a casual environment that was made easy by his banter with the heavy Italian accented waitress (name?) who made a comeback some years later. For quite some time the restaurant was Il Forno; that is until corporate giant Il Fornaio entered the fray and sued him to change the name. After much rigmarole he changed to aqua e sale -- and notice Il Fornaio has since closed its doors? LOL. Again after much hoopla, he made it Daniels. The current wood-paneled decor makes me think of a city club in San Fran or London. Very posh, yet understated. Selections of sculpture and art from his travels dot the restaurants three small dining rooms. The menu is a very difficult one. I say that because it has all of your favorites and it is difficult to make your final selection. Great for steak, ravioli, the best carpaccio in the city, best buffala mozzarella, mmm.... I could go on and on. So does the menu, page after page. Some might call the preparations simplistic. This is the Tuscan way. Simple ingredients and simple preparation. Let the ingredients make their own magic. Grilled rack of lamb is not drowned in some Smuckers lime jelly, but gently brushed with rosemary and garlic, tickled with salt and pepper and finished with a squeeze spray of lemon. Unfortunately the artful one-of-a-kind plates and bowls handmade in Vietri chipped at the edges over the years and the health department made him throw them away -- UGH!! -- they were a beautiful motivation to make you lick your plate clean to see the painted pictures beneath your scrumptious dinner. Not that you needed an excuse to dab every last bit of sauce with the wonderful mini loaves of bread cooked right there in the hearth that started it all. Daniel himself is a wonderful host. He loves to give his guests a wonderful experience. There are many choices for Italian food in Phoenix. Most of it is just American Italian. Daniels is a unique touch of the simple yet elegant. Enjoy. P.S. [post edit] OMG. How could I forget the Tiramisu? Its a generous portion, so you can share with your guest, but after your first bite you may not want to. Light and airy, yet fantastically flavorful, the quality of the coffee really makes this dish a reason to go back again and again. Im not going to tell you the secret ingredient. Youll have to ask Daniel."
5,"One of my fave places in Phoenix. Well stocked and friendly staff. I dont normally peruse the DVDs or CDs because they tend to be pricey,but one day I just decided to take a look. Thats when Borders became one of my fave places. I was able to find a fairly rare documentary DVD. I paid 40 bucks for it,but have never seen it offered for sale anywhere before. I very much appreciate a business who refuses to cowtow to the ridiculousness of political correctness. For that alone was well worth paying 40 bucks for. I was even more impressed by the staffer who rang up my purchase for not only being knowledgable about the DVD but letting me know they had a biography of the director of the film that had just come in. Even though the shipment had not been tagged and put on the floor for sale yet,the staffer called to have someone open the box,and bring a copy for me to look at. I bought that too! I will coninue to patronize Borders and any other book store that chooses not to censor!"
1,"I have never been treated so rudely in a retail establishment ever. I went to the shop with my daughter, her friend and my niece...all young adults. I showed a picture of the project we wanted make to the woman working there and she scoffed at me.  I noticed she was playing Solitaire on her iPad...apparently we interrupted her game. She then proceeded to tell us that she would have to open the door and turn on the air conditioner because her mother, the owner of the store, would be back soon and is extremely allergic to fragrance.  The girls and I had body lotion on, this is the desert for crying out loud, and not one of us had perfume on.  Then the mother arrived, there was a brief conversation behind the curtain and she walk out with a towel over her mouth and nose commenting on having to open the door. Seriously? Unfortunately we had picked out some stuff to buy and Im sorry that I spent the $68. I could have spent more but the experience was so distasteful that we hurried out. If I knew how to give less than 1 star, I would. It was unbelievable. I empathize with the woman and her allergies, but the situation could have been handled so much better."
2,"This place was a disappointment.   Im a big fan of a good Italian Beef sandwich.  I was introduced to it when I lived in the Chicago area in 2001.  Since Ive moved back to AZ, I am always in search of a good one.  Lately, on my way to Anaheim for a little family fun, I stop at Portillos in Buena Park or Moreno Valley.  This is a must.  Needless to say this is what I compare Italian Beef sandwiches to. The Italian Beef sandwich at Als just did not compare.  Not only was the beef dry even though I got it wet, but it just tasted different.  It was definitely an unexpected taste for me.  The rest of the family agreed too.  The hype was there but did not deliver or meet my expectations for me. To top it off, the service wasnt the best either.  It took a few times for the cashier to get the order right.  And even though the order was right they still managed to screw up one of the items we ordered.  Though they did rectify it.  And to top it off, we ordered a ""chopped"" salad.  The lettuce wasnt even chopped.  What?  Not chopped?  Its the little things. We ended up leaving disappointed.  It was a bust for us and definitely not worth the trek from Chandler."
2,"Over the last 5 years or so, Ive eaten lunch at Dillys Deli a couple dozen times. The location is excellent, as it is near my office, and the interior décor is clean, modest, and charming. The music seems to vary, but on todays trip, it appeared to be a mix of oldies and jazzy easy listening. While Ive never had to wait for a table to clear, seating can be limited during lunch hours. The service is friendly and quick and the menu offerings plentiful and interesting. Vegetarians will find a handful of options here, though it is likely you can request to omit meat from any sandwich or salad.  Carrying Boars Head ingredients is a plus, however the way their sandwiches are assembled and the ratio of ingredients used simply doesnt work for me. Oftentimes, I find my sandwich has a bulge of deli meat in the center and much less (and sometimes none at all) toward the outer parts nearing the crust. It has been my experience that the wraps are not treated this way, though the only wrap Ive tried (Mexi) lacked flavor and tasted processed.  Ive eaten one salad at Dillys - the Greek - and, while it is tasty, I discovered a dead fly in it halfway through and havent ordered a salad there since.  As other reviewers have reported, the soups arent as piping hot as Id like, though the variety and additional ""daily soup"" is appreciated.  The bread is deliciously soft, warm, flavorful, and large - ideal for accompanying a soup or salad. If youre accustomed to filling up on a sandwich made with normal-sized slices, I suggest ordering a half sandwich so you can sample a side of soup, salad, or dessert as well. All sandwiches are served with a pickle spear. The cookies and brownies get 4 stars on their own. Today I gave Dillys another shot and ordered a new menu item, the Red Bird, on wheat. Personally, Im not a fan. The Blazin Buffalo, Dilly Bird, and Smokey Mountain boast far better flavor combinations, IMO. Also, my pickle spear had a hair on it. Dillys is a bit pricier than its nearby competition (All whole sandwiches are $6.99), though a reasonable price if shared. Overall, this is a higher quality sandwich shop than Subway, Blimpie, and the like. Unfortunately, the fly and hair experiences combined with the bread/meat ratio issue guarantee I will not return."
1,"I have nothing more to add, but I dont want anyone to think only a few people had  complaints about this poorly planned ""festival.""  Oh, wait, I do.  I was there with my 4 year old grand-daughter (and my daughter), since there were going to be kids attractions as well as the food trucks. I thought it was nuts that 3 minutes of jumping around cost $3. But I guess it was consistent with the $4 water and $7 beers. And it would help if there was some roadway controls and/or temporary signage. By 11am, traffic backed up (down) Pima from the event to Indian Bend and over towards the 101. Cars were skipping ahead and cutting into line, further delaying entrance.  If success is measured by interest, the festival was a success. If by performance and customer satisfaction, not so much. And how can a vendor commit to showing and not have enough food to feed the presold ticket holders? Why risk your hard-fought reputation?"
1,"Living in this area I frequent Desert Ridge a lot, and have been to this Macaroni Grill several times... their food is actually pretty good which is why I let the horrible service slide a few times... My friend and I have had experiences such as standing at the host stand with no assistance for several minutes while several employees made eye contact. Of course, no one asked if we had been helped, until the hostess finally made her way back up to the stand and decided to ignore us for another couple of seconds before she even acknowledged us.  Another visit we were seated right away however it took over 15 minutes for our server to come to our table, and that was only after I had to get out of my seat and find one of the employees to ask for our server. I know several people saw us just sitting there, the least they could have done was asked if we had been helped or not.  This last experience, was about a year after the last. I thought maybe they would have changed. I most definitely thought wrong! We were seated promptly and the server was there right away this time. However, our food took FOREVER! Literally, it took over 30 minutes for a medium rare steak and a plate of pasta. I know for a fact they messed something up and ended up taking food out of a to go container and placing it on the plate that they then brought to me (you can see right into their kitchen from the dining room). The server never apologized nor did she come and tell us what the hold up was.  Overall, I will never go to that restaurant again."
3,"Firesky Resort is a marvelous place to unwind and enjoy the warm dry evening air and fire-lit torches.  Whenever I have the opportunity to stay in the Kimpton Hotel Groups locations, I always know Ive made the right choice.  The hotel was beautiful, hip and inviting.   I gave them three stars because the rooms were a nice, but not fabulous, the amenities of Loccitane products definitely helped.  The restaurant Taggio was fine, wasnt spectacular and definitely was the part of the hotel which was least memorable.   The staff was friendly and helpful.  Id stay here again, but with the expectation of enjoying the wonderful pool/cabana area and leaving the resort for dinner.  Scottsdale has so much to offer, what was I thinking...."
2,"Yelp has failed me...I went here based on the reviews I found on here, only to find a restaurant that has fallen off from what it used to be.  I guess this use to be a chef driven restaurant, he created a name for the place. But whatever it is now it has definitely fallen off and definitely not good.  The space is nice enough, I really did not enjoy sitting at the bar and have to look at there dirty kitchen the whole time...But the place does offer a pleasant enough atmosphere.  The food on the other hand was bad. I had the tasting of the appetizers in which everything was overcooked (mushy eggplant) or overcooked and Burnt (anything that had bread like potential) I kinda of wanted to leave after this but I had ordered my Salmon entree from the start...  And now on to the entree which consisted of overcooked salmon, burnt spices on the top, and RAW skin underneath, did not make any since to me. it came with a brick of polenta edible only by the pool of sauce on the plate.  The menu and idea of this restaurant is great, sharp contrasts and bold flavor, but the technique and care is definitely lack here, or maybe they just had a shitty cook that day, I dont know, I just know that I will never make my way back there."
4,"My daughter treated me to a facial here for my birthday. It was lovely and included a massage of my feet and hands. The student was very professional. It normally costs $33 for the signature facial, but was only $25 for my trip since they were running a back to school special for the month of August."
4,"I love that the food was freshly made and the place had a great ""down home"" feel.  The owners are also very welcoming, made us feel like family.  We ordered the Bean Enchiladas, Chicken Enchiladas & Chicken Gorditas.  All came with Rice & Beans.  We all enjoyed our meals.  Good prices also."
5,"Dim lighting. Fleet Foxes. Beautiful upstairs seating that almost seems secret. Band of Horses. Benches that are less cushy than you anticipate them to be. The Shins. Black board specials, just because they look cool. Beirut. $13 vegetable dishes.  Intimidated yet? Fight through the angst. Once you take your first bite of food, all the hullabaloo will be well worth it. Order the forbidden rice bowl. Tell them to make it vegan (the vegetables are usually cooked in a bit of butter)... after all, youre a pseudo-hipster for the evening, and its fantastic. If youre depressed by the idea of black rice as your main carbohydrate, the flat breads are taste-gasmic. That crust... the things Id do for unlimited amounts of that flat bread crust. Top it off with figs and ricotta, and theres no way Im passing up a square or two... or seven. If youre still not sold on the idea of carb-loading, the salmon ""superfood"" is delicious and nutritious, and whos not into a little super(food)iority now and then? But on to the main event... the chocolate stout cake + spiced ice cream + espresso ganache was the best chocolate cake Ive ever had. It was just so damn... moist. There, I said it. Moist. Moist. Moist. Ew. But really, yum. If caffeine, chocolate and alcohol dont suit your fancy (wimp), the cheesecake in a jar was equally delightful. Cookie crust + strawberry compote + cream + cheesecake. Layered. In a jar. Who thought of that? Someone with adorable thoughts, thats who.  And lets be honest, youve earned dessert. I mean... you ordered a healthy, vegan entree over the french onion cheeseburger, right? Right. Of course you did."
4,They are wonderful!
5,"This is a great place to shop, grab a bite, eat dessert, relax, or just hang around. Eat at one of the many excellent restaurants like Christophers, Seasons 52, Black Chili Mexican, and Capitol Grill. Swing by Royal for a cappuccino, iced latte, or your favorite coffee of the day. Savor frozen delight from Haagen Dazs or Mojo Yogurt -- ahhh my sweet Mojo, you and I have been in an on and off relationship for the past year now... by off I mean the 3 or 4 days a week Im NOT there :)  . Movies in the park nights are fun to go to; gasping, laughing, and crying with 200 of your closest (people you probably just met). Get there early for good seats, (about 30 min or more), otherwise youll be stuck behind a tree or some tall guy you cant see around. Be sure to bring a lawn chair along or a blanket to throw down if youll be attending one of these events. The shopping is top notch - but be sure to bring your wallet. Most shops here will cost you at least your first born child, or an equivalent value. Happy shopping to all my yelping buddies!"
4,"I  frequent this joint often to relax outside on the patio and drink wine and/or beer.  The service here is outstanding.  My vegan friend particularly likes this place because they make her vegan friendly pizza.  As a carnivour I love their italian sausage.  And for all you cheese lovers their mozerella is made fresh daily!  I am more of a beer fan than a wine person so it is worth mentioning they have an extensive beer list, including quite a few beers on tap. The sign above the patio says Patio and Wine Bar, so it can be easy to miss if you are looking for the full name on the sign."
5,"I Love Lolos Chicken and Waffles and you will too!  Recently my fiancé and I went to Lolos. I had heard about Lolos and Mrs. Whites for years, but never took the time to go to the Phoenix locations. When this south Scottsdale location opened, I made it a point to go and try the food.  The food is excellent or in my best Brooklyn accent ""Forget about it"". But dont forget about it, the MAC-N-CHEESE is a most try. The chicken is FANTABULOUS, the COLLARD GREENS are on point and they serve Kool Aid. Yes I said Kool Aid. I must have had a gallon of GRAPE KOOL AID. Before this, the last time I had Kool Aid was 1968.  This place is very popular, so you may have to wait for a table, but it is well worth it. This place is so popular that Sports, Music, Acting and Reality celebrities can be seen here regularly. When we were there we saw the rapper Biz Markie. He did the song ""Just a Friend"" back in 1990.   The only down side - although the service was generally good, it gets so busy that at times the server may get distracted and may not come back to you as timely or often as you may like.  BOTTOM LINE, I LEFT FULL, HAPPY AND WITH A KOOL AID SMILE. TRY IT YOU WILL LIKE IT"
5,"This place is still open, but the name has been changed to Juba, and it is under new ownership. Same spot though, and the food has pretty much stayed the same besides a few changes in the menu.  Anyway, I absolutely love coming here. My friend, Molly, is one of the servers, and I love her for introducing me to Ethiopian cuisine. Its definitely a very interesting blend of flavors, but now I come here about once or twice a week and stuff my face. I recommend trying both the vegan combo and the pita sandwich with chicken or falafel. The coffee drinks are delicious too and since theyre made with Ethiopian coffee, the taste is very unique.  If youve been hesitant about trying Ethiopian food, just get over it and go try the food at Juba. You wont be disappointed!"
2,"I was severely disappointed by my experience at Five Guys.  With all the hype that this chain has garnered, I found that little of it held up.  As soon as I walked in the door I was overwhelmed by the smell of smoke that the griddle was wafting through the restaurant.  There were plenty of people cooking and preparing the food, yet it all looked chaotic and unorganized. Just as other people have mentioned, you can choose a whole array of toppings to customize your burger.  That capability is great as long as the cashier rings up your order correctly (which mine was not).  Needless to say I was less than thrilled that I had to battle the smoke so that I could re-explain to the counter staff how my meal was supposed to be prepared.  Along with my burger, I also ordered the regular-sized Cajun fries.  These were definitely fully-seasoned, so if you are averse to spice dont order them.  The regular order of fries turned out to be a modest cup of fries stuffed in a brown bag full of more fries.  It is almost as if Five Guys strategy is to overwhelm you by their generosity with their fries, so that you forget that their burger is mediocre and their fries are sopping wet with grease.   The AYCE peanuts were good though; it is a shame that these were the highlight of the meal."
4,"I really enjoy this course but I am saving the 5 out of 5s for the Troons, Grayhawks and WeKoPas of the world.  Nonetheless, this is a great, very challenging course and you dont have to drive waaaay up north or east of Scottsdale to get there, which is always a great plus.  I remember Golf Digest did a list of Top 25 College Courses and this didnt make it, which I thought was nuts.  My only complaint is that the course isnt really as luxurious as the peak season rate would indicate.  Also, as the other guys who reviewed this mentioned, there is some fantastic ASU swag available in the shop if you are a fan, they probably have every variety you could ever imagine.  Havent eaten there but Teds Hot Dogs is close enough that youd be crazy not to go there after your round."
3,"The food was excellent ... the service not so much.  A colleague and I took one of my clients here for a business dinner. The atmosphere was great, the food was outstanding but the service was embarrassing.  It was a fun, Arizona type feeling restaurant and made quite the difference for my clients who are originally from Scotland.  I had the roasted shrimp and grits. The grits were the best I have ever had (sorry North Carolina!). The shrimp portion was amazing. The dessert was great. I was surprised to see the offering of huckleberries.  Sadly, the server forgot quite a bit of things. My clients wife ordered a second glass of wine to have for dinner, which was forgotten. We also asked for corn bread - the server forgot and brought it with our dessert. He tried to explain that it is made fresh to order and that is why it took so long."
5,"Nearly 3 years after a Waikiki vacation, my longing for a Puka dog has been satisfied. Maui Dog is not exactly the same, nor should it be, but it has the same awesome concept, plus more! Ive been here twice, once had a beef dog, the other a turkey dog. Both with mild garlic mayo & pineapple. These suckers are huge! And messy! And delicious! The dog has good flavor, mixed with the slightly sweet bun, spicy mayo and sweet pineapple...perfect! I think it would have been a better eating experience if my order was not to-go. The mess these things make all wrapped up is not pretty, but that absolutely does not deter from the taste. I cant wait till I have the time to eat-in and try the rest of their tasty-sounding menu!"
4,"I finally made it out to the Rokerijs infamous happy hour and it didnt disappoint. My girlfriend and I had a couple of the small plates, the mushroom toast and stuffed mushrooms (both amazing! but I REALLY loved the mushroom toast) and some wine. The inside is really unique to Arizona and completely relaxing. Our server Eric was super nice and chatted with us a lot about the restaurant and the menu.  We will definitely be back for half priced bottles of wine and happy hour very soon!"
5,"Like Sex or Tobacco? Hells yeah!!!! were not looking for vanilla yes here, this place pulls out all the stops If  Ichi Yakaguru the new york club promoter and 9yo Japanese pimp needed anything, it could be found here. The best selection of DVDs and printed material i have come by in awhile... lots of Toys so much stuff a lot of it is hung above the head, so look up. Lingerie, Tobacco, Human Fire Hydrants, Hobos with Soap Sud Beards"
4,"Had to go to Gila Bend for something and while we were there decided to stop and get something to eat.  Stopped at this restaurant and were glad we did.  We ordered the large meat lovers calzone and wings to split.  The pizza dough they use for the crust is very good.  Nice flavor, slight crispness and not doughy.  Im very particular about my wings and when I verified that they fried their wings we ordered some and we were pleased with them as well.  They made them as we requested, slightly crispy, because theres nothing worse than a soggy skinned wing thats like chewing on a piece of rubber.  Our server, cant recall her name, was very friendly and always checking back with us to see if we needed anything.   There was a group of men a couple of tables away that ordered pizza that looked awesome.  Another table ordered spaghetti with meat sauce and what I think was a very large looking burger with fries, which they had the same idea as us, split to share.  The serving of spaghetti with meat sauce was a nice size serving as well.  Another patron ordered dessert which, according to the server, was a spimoni cake.  It looked really good too.   If you are ever going thru or visiting Gila Bend for any reason, I would suggest that you stop here."
5,"I ordered my custom made door and it arrived recently for installation. The design was exactly to specifications, quality of construction and the finish are flawless. It took several months to get but it was worth it. This one improvement has increased the value of my home and makes my entire family feel safer."
3,"Minnie and I stopped by Papago Dog Park today on a whim...  It was a beautiful day and since she was such a good girl in the car with me and at my afternoon meeting, I wanted to reward her.  Rather than travel out of our way to go to Chaparral Dog Park (our usual dog park destination), I remembered seeing this place, specifically the fenced in / off-leash area, and we swung by. It was just after 4pm, and there were a handful of dogs there, and more were coming the longer we stayed.  Its a lot smaller than Chaparral, and the grass is not the healthiest Ive seen... Unfortunately, there were several areas that owners didnt clean up after their pooches too.  (Come on, owners, you give the rest of us a bad name!) Anyways, we had a nice 30 minute visit... Minnie sniffed out a few other dogs from behind and then they returned the favor to her.  Dont you love how they socialize with each other?!  Too cute. Anyways, will this become our dog park of choice? No. Is this a viable option if youre in the area? 100%."
5,Have eaten here several times.  Always amazing.
2,"Lost baggage and poor child wrangling. Its all about employee empowerment. I have the patience of the Madonna - all right maybe more like the Material Girl - but I am pretty laid back. After my humbling experience in the wine industry, Ive been much more appreciative of service industry related jobs. But when employees are not empowered to answer the most simple of questions, and were checking in on machines with nobody around to handle luggage, well...its a disaster waiting to happen. Its an unfortunate thing that is supposed to help in keeping costs down and help with efficiency - but theres been consistent problems with all of my US AIRWAYS flights. Lets throw JFK airport into the mix to help maximize the disaster...we ended up in Orlando. Waiting for our luggage. Luckily our toddler was entertained with the luggage roundabout...because we waited through two flight arrivals to retrieve one bag.  Family that met up with us for the 4th assured us US AIRWAYS used a really efficient delivery service...Apparently the lost luggage situation is pretty common. Good thing the baby bug is a trooper when it comes to traveling - because Orlando trips tend to be family-heavy and the on-board US AIRWAYS staff consistently doesnt seem too thrilled to be dealing with even the well-behaved ones."
5,We were shopping at the Bass Pro Shop in Tempe and decided to go for ice cream to kill some time before dropping my parents off at the airport. I pulled out my iPad and yelped ice cream. It brought up 4 options in the area and we chose Dairy Queen which was a few blocks away. As luck would have it there was no left turn onto Dobson and we ended up going East on the 202 the opposite direction of the Dairy Queen.  So I searched again and we came up with Yogurtland.  It wasnt luck after all but some ice cream higher power at work to bring us to our frozen yogurt oasis in Yogurtland.  Not only were the ingredients fresh and delicious but the price was reasonable as well. 5 of us each had a scrumptious & generously portioned sundae and our total bill was less than $20! We all enjoyed our selections.  One topping surprise was the Fruit Pebbles cereal my daughter put on her sundae.  The fruity crunch they added was delish!   Yogurtland was a home run!  Thanks For the Yelp!
5,"I recommend this to everyone.  I have never had a bad meal here.  Inexpensive, great service, off the beaten path. Love this place."
4,"Ive been meaning to Yelp for a looong time now, and after having brunch at Scramble today, I thought it only fitting that I give them my Yelp virginity. My boyfriend and I arrived around 1pm and it was pretty quiet. There was a young lady at the counter, taking orders, and another stocking juices nearby. Both were very friendly.  I requested a vegan menu (the vegan options didnt seem to be listed on the large menu near the door), which was quickly furnished to me. There were 2 tofu scrambles, a soy chorizo breakfast burrito and french toast as possible choices. I couldnt decide between the veggie scramble or the french toast, so... I ordered both! My boyfriend went with the bacon and mushroom omelet (off the regular menu). We were offered bread options of white, wheat, rye, or an english muffin. The side dishes were fruit or sweet potato hash... and I think a lot of the menu items come with rosemary potatoes, but we both opted for the hash. The cashier gave us our number. It was a beautiful day, so we found a table outside. In a matter of very few minutes, our food had arrived. I noticed that the vegan items were on red plates to differentiate them. My scramble was yummy, with a good enough amount of veggies in it, and a bit more wet than most other scrambles Ive had. I did find myself wishing the portion was a bit larger.  The order of french toast came with 3 good-sized pieces and was super duper good. The highlight for me, was the amazing sweet potato hash! Its served in a patty and is chock full of onions, zucchini, carrots (I think) and seasoned with rosemary. Ive never had anything like it. I highly recommend it. My boyfriend did seem to enjoy his omelet and definitely agreed with me on the hash. Scramble is a great place, especially considering their vegan breakfast options, which are far too few-and-far-between in the valley. We will absolutely be back!"
5,"This is the largest urban park. Moreover, that urban part is great because I am 10-30 minutes from three major trailhead areas.  For hiking I like many points of entry, one of my favorites is telegraph pass, this is on the south side of the mountain. A new recently remolded parking lot is found on desert foothills parkway. There is a paved path that is about 1/2 a mile and at its end Telegraph pass is to the left and Desert classic is to the right. Telegraph pass grows in steepness towards the top where there are some larger stairs. At the top, there is a bench and you can then continue on National trail. If you head west, you can reach a great Ramada. From the pima canyon entrance I take the fire road to national, after the initial ascent it is just some rolling hills, I then make left to hidden valley where there is a great natural tunnel, Follow this trail to reach fat mans pass, contrary to the name there is a narrow gap that fat men cannot pass luckily you can go around, this meets back up with national trail. Many unique rock formations on this hike.  For shorter easier hikes from this lot, you can do the east and west loops and Beverly canyon all small trails that loop, and have a few nice views. For Mountain biking my skills are not too advanced so I stick to the east end of desert classic, with mostly straight section and a few wash passes and slight hill inclines its great for a novice rider."
2,"After waiting for over a month for this place to open, constantly annoyed by the sign on the door stating, ""Training in Progress"" I was expecting something spectacular.  The name itself ""Revo Burrito, Revolutionary Mex"" set me up thinking I was walking into...a revolutionary burrito joint!  My husband and I were disappointed to say the least.  He had the Chicken Machaca Burrito, which the counter girl said was her favorite.  And it was, well, just a chicken burrito, at best.  There was so much liquid oozing out the bottom from the wet lettuce and wet pico that he had to move his chips to another plate because they were swimming.  I had the Black Bean Burrito.  The menu had stated the beans were slow simmered in garlic, onions & seasonings...sounded delish!  However it tasted like they walked next door to Safeway and bought a can of black beans, heated them up and rolled them into a tortilla.  It was also supposed to include their ""special cheese blend"" AND there was only a SLIGHT SPRINKLE of cheese...literally!  I actually opened up the tortilla to make sure they didnt forget it.  Call me crazy, but when I order a bean & CHEESE burrito, Id like to have at least a small amount of cheese.  I guess their idea of special cheese is magical, disappearing cheese. The rice with corn & a drizzle of cream was especially delicious & the fresh-squeezed lemonade was tart & perfectly sweetened. We also liked the decor & the windowed kitchen. For the price you pay for a very, simple burrito, that offers nothing revolutionary about it, their menu is over priced.  I would rather go to Baja Fresh or any other neighborhood Mexican restaurant."
2,"Good price for the location;however its definitely outdated and appliances are extremely old.. Maintenance people fix things quick but some fixes are sub par.. My neighbor and good friend continue to have water intrusion in there home when it rains hard. They have to have their carpet padding replaced multiple times because of water coming in from under the building. I work for a property management company myself and this half fixed issue is something that Im not impressed with.  Also, every year they increase rent, they dont work with you on price and dont seem to care about good paying tenants (Like myself). They are too corporate and only care about the money and not the longevity of good on time paying tenancy.. The only reasons I stay is because the location and price is good, but also because I hate moving around. I anticipate that rent will continue to go up and well over what other nearing apartments properties have to offer. This would mean that I probably have only another year or two left before rents over $1000 for a two bedroom...  One good thing is that the staff is nice and friendly but supposedly Equity Residential (managing/owning company) doesnt give their property managers enough power to work with their tenants. Its unfortunate really because I would imagine that companies would rather have long term on time paying tenants and negotiate on rental amounts and try to weed out the consistent late or non paying tenants.  Keep in mind that no utilities are included.. Hope to see some change in Equity Residential but because of how corporate they are, I highly dont think that this will happen.."
4,Had the super burger and fries tonight... excellent!  I like that while they do have some tvs on with sports on them... the house music takes front stage.  Might be different on big playoff nights. Also... the tequila thyme drink... delicious and actually had some  alchyhol in it!  Fantastic!
5,"I have been visiting Mrs. Whites going on 30 years, but after looking up the phone number this afternoon to verify if they were open and still had fried chicken, my wife started reading some of the reviews following a recent Food Network recommendation - I almost got cold feet. Good thing I didnt. The food is as awesome as ever. The service is much as it has always been. Be forewarned, trendy restaurant goers, who glom onto TV reviews, Mrs. Whites is not trendy; there are no bubbly fresh blonde girls waiting to seat you. The service is matter of fact, no goofing around, you must get to the business of ordering and pretend you know what you are doing - this is the way it has always been at Mrs. Whites. If you are looking for others to pamper you, this is not the place for that. Mrs. Whites is where you go to pamper your indulgence for perfect soul food. If you want Scottsdale ambiance, again, this joint wont work for you. When you go, be prepared that not all dishes may be on the menu during your visit. There are no corporate owned semi-trailers that deliver two tons of food every other day. This is a small and very cramped operation that makes homemade food for those who know how to appreciate it. In these days of flash frozen prepared dishes that are uniform from visit to visit at chain restaurants, this food is made in a tiny hot kitchen. If they run out of your favorite dish that has been cooking for hours prior to your arrival, there is no way they can whip up another pot of green beans and potatoes in 20 minutes.  I often call ahead to verify if they have what I want because years ago it was not uncommon that by 12:30 they would be out of half of everything on the menu, which was OK because if forced me to try new things Back then, Mrs. Whites was open Monday through Friday from 11:00 till 3:00, but Id swear youd be lucky to get anything after 1:00 - and that was perfectly fine as you knew they were doing all they could with their limited space to do their best for us customers. Id just come back on another day.  To say I have the utmost respect for the White family would be an understatement, today I was afraid I might have to lose that based on those poor reviews below. I do not believe those reviews are an accurate representation of The Golden Rule Cafe. They are the distortions and disappointments of people who have skewed expectations. Funky little hole-in-the-wall family-run operations that attract a loyal customer base may not be the place for everyone, but if you understand that wonderful stuff doesnt always come wrapped in a sterile designer package, then you might get along with Mrs. Whites. I love this place and hope I always will."
4,"Loved the location at atmosphere of this place!  Had a very nice business dinner here last night.  We were able to sit outside thanks to the gorgeous weather, and Id recommend this to anyone.  The houses inside have their charm, but al fresco dining is great!   We had a few drinks at the bar before we started dinner - they have a fairly nice wine by the glass list, as well as a nice stocked bar.  Something for everyone! The menu contained lots of delicious choices, and it was hard to choose.  Ended up going with Hapuku, which was a new-to-me fish from New Zealand, similar to grouper.  It was delicious - tender, flaky, and the earthy vegetables with it were a nice complement. We had very polite service, though not well-timed.  I like when plates are cleared all at once for people, instead of taking plates at the table away when others are eating.  OR, bringing the bill before weve finished dessert.  Both of these happened here."
5,"*** I gave this 5 stars based on the best Mexican food Ive had in AZ, not based on white linen and waiter service, just an fyi*** I wont write too much as it seems that everyone already has. Both locations are GREAT. Some of the best ""homestyle"" Mexican Ive ever had. I usually get the double wrapped enchilada combo that is pure saucy heaven! A great place to call ahead on a friday night when youre exhausted from work and not doing jack, pick up your food, pick up a six pack of Pacifico and head on home. Happiness is a sure bet!"
5,Every time I visit Arizona I love to eat here to food is vary good and I have my wife to thank for turning me on too this restaurant I wish they would have some in Georgia
5,"All I have to say is WOW! This place is EXCELLENT!   All the dishes we had were extremely fresh, authentic, and DELICIOUS!   My favorite pot stickers EVER.  The skin is super thin, tender, not greasy, mostly steamed encased around a very light, delicate dumpling that makes me want to order 2 next time. 6 is just not enough, they are tiny, but oh so delectable! The sauce is perfectly balanced of sweet, spicy, and tangy and does not overpower the pot sticker.  It also comes with a thin airy, crispy (rice chip?) underneath the pot stickers that give it an extra texture with scallions scattered about.  MMMMMMmmmmm. The green curry is more brothy than others than others that I have had, but no matter...It is delicious with bits of vegetable, and whatever meat you prefer..we got chicken.  I love sopping it up with rice and trying to eat it with chopsticks.  You may need a spoon :)  The eggplant and chicken stir fry is also fabulous.  The asian eggplants are cooked to perfection. Their sauces are spot on.   BEST Coconut ice cream!  It is light, fluffy, icy, dreamy, pea-nutty, coconut cloud confection that makes my mouth water!  It is not sickly sweet sticky artificial coconut tasting at all...Predominant coconut flavor is not my favorite and I LOVE THIS!  Even if you dont like curries, there is plenty of food here that will make you a fan!  This is a mom and pop kind of place, they are really nice.  Its a trek for us, but definitely worth the drive!"
4,"I have been to this restaurant a couple of times and I always leave happy and satisfied. I love coming here for the view as it reminds me of home.   We came here once again for a special occasion which was a farewell dinner for my mom who was visiting from South Africa. I had made a reservation using Opentable and asked for a nice view as a treat to my mom on her final night.   The hostess reserved us a table with a splendid an unrestricted view. We had a very attentive waiter - Luis - who treated us with colorful and informative descriptions of the menu. He also took care of us with an exquisite after dinner treat seeing as how mom was leaving.   The dinner was exceptional - as always, so was the atmosphere, the company and the wine. Do go here!   I suggest arriving a little before the dinner reservation to enjoy drinks on the patio while watching the sunset...always a treat! Call ahead of time to find out whether the patio will be open - it has happened to me twice that it was reserved for private functions. (Which was totally my bad - but maybe someone else can benefit from it.)"
4,"Their sandwiches are excellent! I like to get the slider trio with bbq chicken, brisket, and pulled pork. Their potato salad is pretty decent but not as good as grandmas ;). Also, their coleslaw is quite nice but just a touch of too much mayo. Now comes the bad part: the ribs. I absolutely love bbq ribs and unfortunately theirs were dry with very little meat on the bone. I would not recommend the ribs here to anyone. Stick with the sammys and youll be all good."
4,"I loved the crispy crust of the pizza thought it was super good.  I think if you havent been there and are at the San Tan Mall shopping that its worth a visit.  We went on a double date and it was a pretty good experience.  The only issue I had was that I thought they had a very small dining area, which was probably the reason for the 45min wait.  Also we went on a friday night and probably because of the small area it got very loud, which I know the management has no control over, but just an fyi of my experience.  Id say if you havent been and you love pizza its worth the visit.   I may try and stop in for lunch sometime but definitely not on a Friday night, it was just too busy."
3,"Ive been here for a couple of happy hours. I agree with Charles R - no need to pay full price (especially as the regular prices are a bit hight) and it is better than Ra. Definitely not the best sushi Ive had in town, but the drinks are good (cucumber mojito!) and the place is set up well for happy hour groups. The servers I have encountered are all VERY patient with people coming and going within the group and individual checks for everyone.  Knowing what a pain that is, I really appreciate how willingly they do it. For good sushi, I will stick with Yasu or Sakana.  For happy hour, this is a great place - and the Tempe Marketplace location is convenient to several friends."
1,"$8 for a tiny sandwich with one egg, two greasy strips of bacon, and a stale muffin. They say its pricy because they get it local? It has to have substance to be considered anything. So whack."
4,I was so excited to visit The new Postino in Gilbert!!! I love and frequent the original but this new location is much closer to my house. Bruschetta is amazing!!! Love the atmosphere and staff too. Wine selection rocks!!! Great Happy hour prices!!! Highly recommend a visit!
4,"Like the other reviewers have said the service is really not that great.  Luckily theyre saved the  really good food that they have.  We ordered so much food that our little two top table  couldnt possibly handle it all.  The mussels  might have been the best Ive ever had. We also shared a Frito misto, which is really good except theyre pretty chintzy with the shrimp they only gave us too.  The pastas were clearly handmade which appreciate and theyre quite good. The owner came over to check on us a couple times which I appreciated.  Im definitely coming back soon."
4,"#26, #1, #150 is my favorite. I go here every time I need something warm in my belly. They are open early too! I love this place and the dining area has gotten bigger :) Had the Bun bo hue. Was pretty good and cheap!"
5,"Do you like trendy shit-music and half dressed plastic surgery queens gyrating all around you, while you pay twelve dollars for your appletini? If your answer is yes, dont bother coming here.  Dive bars are plentiful in Phoenix, but the Bikini is in my hood. Its a dirty, unassuming place, with a couple of no-nonsense bartenders and a good jukebox.  There are a couple of rules to follow when visiting the Bikini:  1. Bring cash. Cards arent accepted, the atm machine is there for decoration only, as it hasnt worked in at least two years.  2. Dont make fun of the guy in the overalls and farmer hat. Hes my neighbor.  3. Dont piss off the bartenders. Tip them well, treat them nicely, and dont order more than three dirty martinis. If you are nice to them, they will be nice to you. This includes, but is not limited to: the strength of your drinks, the price of your drinks, and whether or not you get a drink at all. They take no shit.  If you cant handle it, stay away. The place gets crowded enough as it is."
2,"2 stars because I really did like the eye doctor I saw, she was awsome.   Thought I was off to a good start getting new glasses.  I picked out my frames while I waited to be taken care of.   Oh...wait...the eye glass gods had something else in store for me.   The person helping me couldnt get an authorization code from my insurance company because it was afterhours.  He actually told me I had to pay full price or come back tomorrow.  Now keep in mind that I have had this insurance forever, never had any problems before; after hours, weekends, etc.  So I used my cell and called the insurance company.  I get someone on the phone who is trying to help us.  I put eyemaster guy on the phone and he actually got into a fight with the woman on the phone, handed it back to me and said here you talk to her, Im done.   So the lady got me the authorization code and a explaination that this doesnt happen because most eye glass providers can take care of everything in spite of the insurance company being closed and she also asked me if I was sure I shouldnt switch eyemaster locations due to this guys behavior.   But I thought I was done.  I have my glasses picked out and I needed them to drive.  So while she was talking to me the guy at eyemasters was throwing out insults loud enough that the lady could hear.   So I lost 1/2 hour of my time and think the worst is over Well...those darn eye glass gods...I cant get them in an hour because it was too late in the day the guy tells me.  He has the right lens and it was only 6:00 pm,  come back tomorrow.   So I called today and was told 1/2 hour and they will be ready.  I drive over there on my lunch hour and guess what.  They arent even close to being ready.  So I walk around the mall, come back and guess what, only 1 pair is ready.  That would normally be ok but the attitude of the two guys working is arrogant and not very customer friendly.  I laugh it off and leave.   So what are the odds Ill get my glasses after work today???  One can only wonder.  Awful service, unprofessional and unpleasant to experience."
4,"How can I not show yelp love for the original fro yo shop that kept my addiction fulfilled in the early days of the fro yo phenomenon? Yes, that is what Golden Spoon is to me.  When I first moved to Phoenix from college, I was coming from an area that was overloaded with frozen yogurt shops for the college girls who shared my love of the frozen treat. Unfortunately, Phoenix hadnt quite yet jumped on the bandwagon and so the only choice was Golden Spoon. To make matters worse, the only locations were north on Shea or South in Awatukee. So, since I was living in Old Town, the Shea location was typically my choice.  I can say that I added several miles on my car very willingly to treat my taste buds to Golden Spoon. Yes, it was the closest shop to me but its also creamy and completely delicious. The frozen yogurt is served by staff and comes in different sizes. You can choose from multiple toppings and its just your ""old fashioned"" frozen yogurt shop. Im using old fashioned very loosely in this sense, since frozen yogurt is anything but old fashioned, but with the self-serf trend, Golden Spoon is ""old fashioned"" compared to that.  I dont visit Golden Spoon as often as Id like anymore because it is still a bit of a drive, but anytime Im in the area, I know just exactly where to stop for a sweet frozen treat!"
5,"Loves the recent Cezanne show. In fact Ive seen it twice in the last week. I need to find out more about who curated the exhibit as it is very fine. The Oriental collection is very nice and soothing.  The Downtown Chamber Group gave a wonderful concert in the great hall on Sunday. I wonderful and unusual program of saxophone and harp. I think it is great to have music in the galleries. I liked the musicians being on a platform. since the room isnt banked one can see the performers. A few things Im not so crazy about: The great room is this awesome space for large art. Sunday I sat and looked at it for several hours. You know, not such great art. I find the Terrill boring and the other pieces uninteresting. The cafe never quite lives up to its promise. My lunch companion barley touched her lunch and the waiter never asked why or offered a box. Enough grousing I love the place and go often."
5,A great restaurant staff! They go above and beyond for their customer. Try the buffet you will not be disappointed. Bacon is cooked to perfection. Fruit is fresh and the seating is perfect for large groups.
4,"Well it was St. Patricks day and I could not think of anywhere to go but here, that might be celebrating. Oh the were definately into it up in here! haha patrons and staff were both decked out for the day in green and with hats, tee-shirts, plastic jewlery and just about anything you can find related to the day.The crowd was happy and I talked to a lot more people than on the average stop in. The dining room and bar were both filled. The Irish music was filling the place, the green beer was flowing as one might expect at a discounted rate. There was a corn beef & cabbage plate special being offered up as well as the usual menu items and the Wed .40 cent wing deal they now have started. There was St Paddys day decoration and give aways from happy hour into the evening. A fun and lively pub it was. My only complaint was that drinks were all being served in limp little plastic cups; mixed drinks and the beer."
5,"I work next door, and I love her ! She has done an excellent job of slim fitting my baggy shirts !!  Well she did ask me if I was gay but then hey, given how animated I get about clothes I dont blame her for askin ! My SO found this rather amusing and laughed her head off... oh well getting back to my review.  I love nadya cuz she does a wonderful job, each time. She knows when the darts will give the slimming effect and when the sides are to be taken in. Its never too tight and never too lose, and she always always delivers on time.   I have been here atleast 10 times !! Trust me my metrosexuality wouldnt let me let me go back if it wasnt a five star service!!"
5,"Located in the space formerly occupied by LGOs short lived Radio Milano, the north side of Campbell has been reincarnated as the Arcadia Room, a private dining facility operated by the aforementioned restaurant group. I dined here recently for the hubbys work dinner. Unlike so many private facilites that feel like a corporate conference room, the Arcadia Room is a cool, casual, restaurant - all to your self. We had about 60 in our group, and had plenty of room to mingle at the sleek bar lining one side of the room, or gather by the open kitchen.The weather was blazing hot when we were there, but there is even a lovely little patio outdoors for guests. I think this would be an ideal location for any work or social occasion where you want an intimate atmosphere combined with reputable fare."
4,"A comfortable little wine shop situated just south of Old Town Scottsdale.  Every Thursday they bring in a distributor or vintner to showcase a set of wines at their bar and collection of tables set off to the side.  For $15 you usually taste five or six wines of decent quality, the best part to the price is that $10 of each tasting goes into purchasing a bottle of one of the wines tasted. The atmosphere is quite an eclectic mix of high-brow, with food and clientele from Atlas Bistro migrating in, and casual.  The people running the place couldnt be more nice or more knowledgable in the wines they sell either.  The prices may be a touch above somewhere like BevMo, but if youre looking for the perfect wine to go with gnocchi in a basil cream sauce, these are the guys to ask!"
2,"I went to Sutra to attend the mixer where Yelp was being featured. After soaking in the cool ""sceney"" vibe, I decided that I was hungry. I asked the waitress for a menu. When she came back she told me that the right hand side of the menu was half off and made a couple suggestions. I love the names of the rolls that Sutra has. There were selections like ""Cougar"" and ""30k millionaire"". I had one of each. As if the rolls were made to live up to their namesakes, they didnt impress me; they merely annoyed me. The lack of freshness and flavor were the biggest factors in Sutras failure. I ended up leaving plenty of sushi on my plate, but I was relieved that they were half off, otherwise I would have returned them upon first bite.  I would not eat at Sutra again if I had a choice. I would advise you to eat elsewhere and come to Sutra to see and be ""scene""!"
2,"I heard nothing but praise about the food and atmosphere of this chain restaurant.  I loved the look of this place inside and out. Great rustic barrels and old barber chairs in the bar area gave a unique look. Service was friendly and fast.  Food was less than desirable. Salad was nothing but iceberg lettuce (and I got a stump) with some shredded red cabbage. My pasta dish was spaghetti with a white clam sauce. It was too salty and there was a sprinkling of microscopic clam bits.  I always take leftovers home, this time I didnt. While the prices are good its not worth a less than average meal. Husband was equally disappointed with his chicken marsala. Chances of going back are slim to none."
4,"The burgers and fries here are pretty good, but the custard sundaes and concret mixers are amazing. The PBC & B i will go back for over and over again as well as try the other items. Great place."
4,"Good food, friendly people. We like the Gold Strike Burger -- we get it almost every time. Also try the shrimp appetizer and the bread pudding dessert. Appetizer and dessert, plus a Kiltlifter Beer or two, is sometimes all you need.  The only sad thing is, because they are a bit off the beaten track, they will have to close for the summer, until November. We will miss them until then."
2,"Walking in to Five Guys, I was rather excited, and was looking forward to my experience. I have never been to a Five Guys before, so this was something new. My first reaction upon opening the doors was the music was blaring. Too loud, at least. The music was classic rock, which I dont mind. After walking up and reviewing the easily understood menu and waiting in line for a few minutes, someone took our order. The order taker seemed like she was having a long day, not seeming very interested in the customer. While taking the order, one could clearly see the kitchen. It seemed kind of like In-N-Out, but everyone was moving much slower. It was as if everyone was moving in slow motion. Much to my dismay, they did not offer Dr. Pepper, my favorite soft drink. I was surprised that they offered other lesser known drinks, but not Dr. Pepper? Come on. After waiting about 6 or 7 minutes, my food arrived in a bag. A bag? Really? I was planning on eating inside, not take out. Even McDonalds does better than that. Digging through the bag I first took out the fries, which were in a cup, and I took a bite. My first impression of the fries was they were nothing special, and too salty. I like salt on my fries as it adds flavor, but there was simply too much salt. As a result, in addition to the fact that the serving was quite large, I finished only about half of my fries. Now onto the burger. I paid about $10 for my meal, so I was thinking to myself that this better be the best burger I have ever tasted in a long time. Unwrapping the product in its tin foil wrapping, I noticed that the presentation of the burger was sub par. The burger did not look appetizing, at all. Almost disgusting, as a matter of fact. The cheese was dripping over the bun, and I couldnt even see all the ingredients on the burger. Taking my first bite, it didnt taste bad. A pretty classic American burger taste, I must say. It did taste rather close to Wendys.  Upon finishing my meal, I was not impressed. My stomach felt greasy, and I felt the need to go hike a mountain a couple times, which I did, as Tempe Butte is close by. I felt my stomach almost on the point of rejecting it, it was that greasy. Seriously. Overall, Five Guys is way to expensive, unbelievably greasy, and makes your stomach cringe. The atmosphere is nice though, thus the two stars.  If you had to choose between Five Guys and In-N-Out, INO is the clear winner in every category."
3,"The restaurant has 6 tables which make it possible for you to eat-in, but this place is definitely more suited towards take out or delivery.  Just dont expect service if you eat-in.  You order at a counter and if you choose to eat-in, you will get your soup in a take out container, eat on paper plates and styrofoam cups, but get your entrees served on platters. The house special won ton soup was pretty tasty and was loaded with a variety of fresh veggies, as well as chicken, pork, and shrimp pieces.  However, one key ingredient was missing - won tons! General Tsos chicken was fried and served with broccoli and sufficient sauce.  The Mongolian beef was more Mongolian and less beef. Overall the food was OK, except for the disappointment of the missing wontons, and I would probably consider this place again for delivery."
2,"Best beer selection in Arizona but the good features end there.  Its the only reason I return and put up with the following.  Service is often horrible, even during the day when there are few patrons.  Often you have to go up to the bar to order even when there is a server in your section.  It makes no sense that a mug of beer should be empty for more than 10 minutes before it is noticed. Food is subpar and wouldnt get such a pass from most people if this place didnt have the beer.  Prices are reasonable.  Website is often inaccurate re: what is actually on tap."
5,"My boyfriend and I stopped by to grab a bite to eat before work and long story short -Greeted immediately  -Lots of variety -Meat lovers pizza is amazing -Ask for Tawnya shes really nice and a wonderful server  -Will be back, loved the excellent service!!"
4,"This is one of Scottsdales new hot spots. If you like the Scottsdale scene, this place is a must. Sunday the music goes off as Thomas James spins sic house beats and the bar serves up $2 tacos. On the weekends, it is still the hot new local spot so it is always busy. Fun place to go and usually there is great eye candy."
4,"Upon first glance this is appears to be a very usual strip mall type bar but behind the black glass lies a more unusual bar and grill. We went on a Sunday for the Jets-Ravens game and it was a fun time.. This is one of those places you likely have passed a hundred times on the way to work or going to Scottsdale using Indian School Rd. It is set back into the strip mall so you would not see it from the street. Why Teakwoods is special comes from its extremely quality food which you would not expect from a place that lets you throw peanut shells on the floor. Like most bars it has a bevy of TVs and a rowdy but pleasant crowd.  The food was really good though I would never call this ""fine dining"". An extremely great place to go when you want to be stuffed with semi-greasy food..I had their famous wings and I can honestly say they were outrageous. I especially liked the cheese balls which are hard to find as WineBurger stopped carrying them. No particular reason this place wasnt 5 stars..it just didnt have that 5 star feel..maybe in the future when I go back."
3,"If I could give this 2.5 stars, I would.  But thats because Ive been to Joes Real BBQ, and so I know how good BBQ can be. Famous Daves is fine.  There are two of them I know of, and Ive been to both.  Theyre both fine. We visited this one, near Chandler mall, for lunch.  We ordered off the lunch menu.  My wife and I both had the brisket sandwich.  I had the Wilbur beans, she had fries.  It was fine.  Not great, but OK. The brisket meat itself did not seem to be smoked.  At all.  Meat has a certain look and taste when it has been smoked, and this just didnt have it.  Frankly, the meat seemed sorta pale...as if it had been boiled instead of grilled or smoked.  And either the meat or the sauce was excessively salty.  It wasnt severe (or I would have returned it), but it was noticeable.  Salt should enhance flavor, not stand out as a major flavor. And a note about the sauce.  I examined one of their for sale bottles (you can buy their sauce to take home).  Did they use molasses or brown sugar, as most self-respecting BBQ chefs would?  No.  High fructose corn syrup.  Yuck.  Besides that stuff being poison to your pancreas, its just ""not right"".  Thats not how BBQ is done. Anyway, Famous Daves is really nothing special.  The BBQ is ""OK"", but not very authentic.  Given the choice I would take Joes, hands-down.  But if you want some BBQ, and are nowhere near Joes, this will do.  Beats the heck out of Toms BBQ, thats for sure (see my review of Toms...truly awful).  And the beans and fries are pretty good."
4,"My guy and i decided to try this new salon that just opened a couple months ago. The man and woman working there are so friendly! We were chatting the whole time. As soon as we sat down they offered l us water. The chairs are great and the water color changes as you sit there, kinda cool. The pedicure includes a hot lotion and rock message that is awesome!  Great place, we will be back!"
3,I love Defalcos.  I hate Defalcos.  The food is always fresh and Im never disappointed.  The big problem is that the service is so slow.  Its  great that they have a market for you to look around while you are waiting for your food.  I know I can get quality tasting food but I have to here when I know Im not in a rush to be somewhere.
5,"If you really care about your health and want a sincere doctor who honestly cares about his patients and believes in his practice, then this is the doctor for you. I am a 40-year-old woman who couldnt be happier with the care I have received and how I feel after seeing Dr. E for the past year. I recommend Dr. E to all my friends and family and the ones who actually listen have been very happy with their care as well.  In response to Lisa N., it is possible that you are one of the few people who is immune to Botox and similar products, which is to no fault of the doctor. I too was extremely unhappy with subsequent treatments given by another doctor only to find out that no amount of the toxin would ever be effective for me because my immune system works too well. Ironic, isnt it?  You should always do your homework when looking for a new doctor, especially when you know exactly what type of treatment you are seeking. For example, if you are simply interested in the HCG diet program instead of overall health and you had been elsewhere for less money then likely that place is a better match for you.  We dont live forever, but we can live better while we are here. Take control of your medical care, its your body and therefore your decision. Dr. E at Carefree Health Path is a great place to start your empowering journey to health."
5,"After eating chocolate covered bacon for desert (yeah, thats really one of the options for desert), I say that I was completely stratified with Becketts Table. From the moment I called to make a reservation I knew that this restaurant was going to have great staff and service. The staff greeted us at the entrance and give us options for seating. I was VERY pleased with the pricing on the menu especially the wine bottle prices! Its just a matter of time, and I will be back for an evening meal! Speaking from living in the Arcadia area, this is just the restaurant we need in the area--a nice community restaurant with pleasing food! If you are looking for a nice dining experience, this is the place for you!"
4,"Had a great time staying here for a few days.  Golf course was amazing (payed twilight for $75 on the desert course starting at 1pm).   Was able to do a nice long 3 hour hike Camelback mountain. Service is excellent here and accomodations are lovely.  24 hour pools and hot tubs are nice. As are the fire pits... But nothing is cheap here for sure! $22-27 scotches by the firepits.   $10 bagel sandwiches at the ice cream parlor by the lobby.   Dont come here if you dont like to spend money!  Also, i would avoid eating the meals here. Food is not the best and it costs an arm and a leg.   Would love to come back for some more golf and hiking.  You def. get more perks staying at Canyon Suites (free wifi, free access to business center, nicer and more private pool and hot tub area, better free wine tasting, and nice amenities like free cider, arnold palmer, fruit, and cookies throughout the day."
3,"Lavelles just opened the end of April. So far Ive been twice once for lunch and once for ice cream. Both times I waited about 15 minutes. Understandable considering their new. I wanted to make my own type of sandwich and the older women said they dont do that. Okay. So I wanted to get the arizona sandwich with a different bread, she says the bread change is 1.00. Really?! Sandwich also had no mayo/mustard. All in all its good to have new restaurants out here, but this one is just okay. **Update: I have went in on 2 different dates to get ice cream. Only to find out the 2 flavors I want are gone. Should get back-ups of their items."
5,"I moved from Philly this past summer and Ive searched all over the Valley for a ""GOOD"" Pizza. After eating lots of tasteless and cardboard pizza, I found Momma Mia when I moved into Arcadia! I love the hole in the wall vibe! Just like home :) The sauce is great and super tasty! The dough tastes slightly sweet and is fluffy..Its what makes the pizza so great and there is a brickoven!! I love it! My husband and I order the pizza/wing special .The wings are so hot and spicy ( we order the hot, but it comes in buffalo and mild) They have an extensive menu of pasta, sandwiches and salads. I want to try their Philly Steak next, but for the time being I still make mine at home.  Every pizza place likes to say its ""New York Style"", but this place really does a NYC pizza. Well the best nyc pizza youre gonna get in AZ, Something about the water."
4,"Im a gelato purist, so Chill is right up my alley. You dont have a million flavor choices, but the ones they have are classics done right, so there is no need. The same lady is always working when I go, and she is very friendly and upbeat. They havent yet perfected the multi-flavor ratio in one cup, but Im sure that will improve, and Im a huge fan of anything with a punch card. So far my favorite gelato spot in the Valley :)"
4,"I went here for dinner since my friend said the the location in Cave Creek was one of her favorite Mexican restaurants in the Valley. However, living in Phoenix and Scottsdale, we decided to go to the Fountain Hills location. Plus, another friend lives there so it was a more central location for all of us.  We arrived around 7 and it wasnt crowded at all, we got a table right away. We got chips and salsa to start which was perfect since I was really hungry with it being way past my dinner time. One of the girls got a pomegranate margarita and she said that it was really sweet but good. I got the fish tacos and they were delicious. Probably the best fish taco Ive had. I was expecting some sort of fried fish, probably cod. I was pleasantly surprised that it was grilled and the two tacos came wrapped up in the foil pouch they were cooked in. It also had this really good sauce. The hard shell tacos that my friends got also looked really good. The shell looks homemade, fried, and super crispy. My friend asked for extra cheese which they brought out in a small dipping bowl. She was also charged extra for this. The tacos didnt come with that much cheese to begin with, so thats kind of a rip-off. The price isnt that cheap either, I would definitely say its on the pricey side.   The atmosphere was just okay. I was reading how its the most romantic location, etc. but maybe theyre just referring to the Cave Creek location. All of the employees were nice and even took a group photo of us at the end since my friends were visiting from all over. I definitely want to go to the Cave Creek location in the future to see what all the fuss is about, but itll definitely be more of a special occasion thing since its definitely a hike from Scottsdale. In the mean time, Ill stick to my other local favorites for tacos."
5,"I took a friend from Europe here this past week. I cannot express how much the attention to detail is welcomed and so wonderfully presented. By this I mean, the service, the presentation, the food, the atmosphere. The staff knows that when you walk in, you will be spending good money and they expect to take care of your whim and cater to your palette.  The steaks are buttery, delicious and worth every bite. The sommelier made a wonderful suggestion to go with our order and he was spot on in his selection. This may not be the place to dine on a regular basis for some, but if you plan to make a special night of an occasion, I recommend highly Ruths Chris. I have not been to the one in Phoenix, only the Scottsdale location, but I would be hard pressed to say that it would be any less tasty.  My buddy was treated so kindly and his comment (paraphrased) was as follows: Its too bad that so much of the world hates Americans. They think that Americans are so loud and bossy. They can be so kind and so willing to to be helpful when they want. In Europe, no one cares if you are from France or Italy or Dernmark because we are like states next to each other. In America, everyone wants to know about where you are from and want to hear you talk about it and the places you have been. Thank you to the staff for being a part of my friends visit."
3,I will say that the weakest link in this restaurant is the maturity of the staff.  We went for lunch and asked to sit on the patio.  Most of the people were eating but then they sat a large group right next to us that only wanted to drink and smoke.  I know smoking it allowed on the patio but since it wasnt the only table available AND the rest of us were eating food I think they should have sat them a little farther away from us. Our order wasnt right but couldnt get the server to come back so we just let it go.  The food was great!  Had a few items from the small plates and then we had the bacon grilled cheese and the chicken sandwich.  Both very good.   My biggest complaint is that we were ignored unless we were actively looking around for someone and then snagged someone as they walked by.  I will try again as this place is still trying to find its way but service needs to be stepped up for sure.
5,"I was skeptical when I kept hearing how amazing Jimmy Johns is.  So I went in, and found my new favorite sandwich spot!  The inside was very noisey, but I liked the atmosphere.  The bread had an awesome fresh taste, and when I inquired about the difference between 2 sandwiches, the cashier was very helpful."
4,"Hipster hangout you can drag the kids along and not feel bad about it. The place is setup like a house and the first time you go it is for sure confusing.  Do I sit down or go to the counter or bar or what.. Its kind of a free for all.  I have been a few times and still feel a little awkward when I walk in.  The hot chocolate is great and the egg sandwich tasty.  The mac and cheese for evening is also really good.   The service is ok, but not overly helpful or friendly. The place is dripping with kids too cool for school, businessmen, and families... so a great spot to hit up if you are in downtown phx"
1,"I dined at this restaurant on a Saturday morning and was actually the very first guest.  I got greeted by the hostess and was promptly seated.  The service was phenomenal from when I walked over the door step and the ambiance is the restaurant was amazing .  I ordered the smoked salmon as an appetizer and the daily scallop special as the entree. When my salmon dish came out I said to my self ""WHAT in the hell?"" Two extremely thin slices of salmon, little salad, and a piece of bread with some aioli on the side.  Salmons cheap and they charged me $15 for this crap?  I work in the food industry and the food was crap. Next, the entree.  The waiter described the the scallop dish like it was heaven on earth.  Explaining to me how delicious this special was.  So I took his advice and ordered.  When the dish came out I said to my self again ""What in the HELL?""  Four small scallops, 2 baby carrots, broccoli rabe, and cilantro sauce.  The scallops werent seared enough, the broccoli rabe was brown and mush, and the baby carrots were still raw.  The funny thing was.  The sauce didnt even resemble any cilantro flavor at all.  I could of made this dish 1000x better and the entree took a big hit in my wallet, $32 for crap. The meal came out to roughly $60 and I left that restaurant to never try it again.  I could of gotten some pho for $8 would of been a hundred times happier than spending money that wasnt even mediocre."
4,"As best as I can figure out, there are 3 German restaurants in the Phx metro area.  Two of them are in the same parking lot in Mesa.  How does that happen? So anyway, what about Zur Kate.  Good food but an oddly small menu with no appetizers listed.   As for the restaurant itself its a pretty small place.  Not sure how the busy they get, but if they ever do you could be in for a wait. Back to the food for a moment.  While it was good, and somewhat German in composition Im just not sure of German food it was.  That being said, I could say the same for the other German restaurants here in Phx.  So, not so much of a knock as an observation."
5,Love the pita jungle!!!  My fave is the chicken and hummus appetizer.  Definitely enough for a meal and super cheap too.  Also love the chicken swarma sandwich and the chicken pizza.  You cant go wrong here.
5,"My wife and i just dined at this restaurant. I am a chef and must say that Chef Chriss concept is one I have not experienced.The food was outstanding, service excellent and the decore was creative,down to the flower pot wine bucket and old wooden crate that it sat on.  Our entrees were served on either a bed of sundried ploenta or baby spincach and blackrice.  What really intrigued me was the slaw made of shredded green papaya that was part of the appetizer course. Being a chef I had to share a neat appetizer, that i recently found, using a baby corn shoot!  Chef keep up the suberb Cafe Monarch Bravo."
1,"Your reviews are hilarious!!   (shoot--who was this referring to??) I try to avoid WM.  Im always warned about the possibility of TB or now, pig flu.  I think the hub just doesnt want to go shopping--not that I LIKE shopping. I know someone who worked WM in WA and she says the conditions are just horrible for employees.  Ive spoken to at least one cashier that is actually FRIENDLY and LOVES his job benefits and bonuses.  Hes a minority I guess bc as you all said, YOU CANT FIND ANYTHING and CANT GET HELP without attitude, usually.   Im standing there staring at 2 mgrs, and they just ignore me for a few minutes?  I didnt want to interrupt the conversation, so I waited.  FINALLY, one asks if I need help???  NAAAAAH, I was just admiring your huge body and wondered how long it might take me to look that way.  FOOLS!   On my last visit, a customer said ""excuse me"" to the 3 employees behind me in the aisle.  I glanced at her and she sighed, rolled her eyes and shook her head as they all ignored her.  I chuckled and acknowledged her frustration.  Then one employee pipes up with ""OH, Im sorry maam, can we help you?""  She asks to find an item, the customer thanks them, they say ""Youre welcome"", the customer leaves and they sarcastically continue to each other: ""THATS WHAT WERE HERE FOR.  NO, THATS NOT WHY WERE HERE.  Were not here to find stuff for stupid people, we have better things to do.""    Thats why, when I walk by an employee working, if they lay eyes on me, they immediately look away and pretend to be engrossed in their job, to avoid stopping to help.  WT?  Whats wrong w/this management???   I agree, you can find some deals and save some money, but the attitude is over the top.  There are a FEW employees that actually smile and appear friendly, at least when I see them, and I can point them out.  If not for the more often than not occurences as mentioned above, I stay OUT of WM as much as possible, which is a lot.  Ive drastically reduced my trips there, but more importantly, Ive cut out a huge chunk of purchasing from WM."
5,Yum yum yum. Husband and I first went there early on a First Friday night and were pleasantly surprised to be seated right away. We didnt want anything too heavy since we were planning on doing some walking so we split the Spanish cheese plate which was delightful. The fig cake is delicious!! Splitting the plate made the bill pretty affordable and it was just enough to fill us up without overdoing it. The server was very helpful in suggesting a champagne for me and red wine for husband. Dont remember what we had but my champagne had a strawberry in it and was perfectly bubbly.  Ambiance and decor is nice and mellow. Weve since been back with friends and it has been enjoyable for both a date night and chatting it up with people. Enjoy!
5,"What started out as a simple attempt to find a perfect birthday present turned into a life-long relationship with a fantastic jeweler.  I wanted to get my fiancé (girlfriend at that time) a simple diamond pendant necklace for her birthday and could not find anything that even came close to matching her style. I searched the internet for days and reluctantly went into a few jewelry stores hoping for the best, but expecting the worst. I, like most people [guys] out there, had a bad feeling in a few stores I went to. Pushy sales people looking for the upsale, and sky high prices. I was getting very discouraged about the process, but that all changed when I came to Hyde Park.  The super friendly staff made everything easy for me. There was no pushy sales process or anyone trying to upsell me something I didnt want. They immediately offered me a bottle of water and started to talk to me like a real person. After a few minutes of speaking with a very lovely woman in the store she suggested we think about something custom. At first  I was thinking ""here we go; this is where I am going to get stuck!"", but I was all wrong!!! We looked a few loose stones and I got a great education about diamonds. I went home later that night and did some research on the internet and found that the prices we as good, or better than any of the big online retailers. I could never get my head wrapped around buying a diamond online, sight unseen, and I am so glad that I found Hyde Park.  In the end I have used Hyde Park to create a custom pendant diamond necklace that my fiancé absolutely loves (it is perfect on her), and I also used Hyde Park to get the diamond for the engagement ring, as well as everything else to follow.  Want to know what service is all about in the jewelry business, check out what Hyde Park did for me. I picked out an amazing diamond for the engagement ring (chose the loose stone again) but had no idea what kind of a ring my fiancé would want. So Hyde Park said ""how about we just put it in a classic Tiffany solitaire setting as a temporary setting and then after you give it to her, you can come back in together and pick out the perfect setting and wedding band set"". I was like, seriously?!! You can just do that??? In the end Hyde Park will be my jeweler for life. They helped me create the perfect simple birthday present, and took that service all the way through doing a custom engagement ring and matching wedding band set. This is the jewelry store for any guy who wants great service, great prices, and like me, doesnt have the first clue about how to make the perfect decision. Just let Hyde Park take the stress out of it like they did for me!"
5,Excellent service and great quality.  I will always bring my alterations here.  Had an emergency and needed a hem done in a couple of hours and they had it sone sooner than expected!
4,"Seriously good curry. Serious. Im not joking. Im serious, the curry is very good. Usually when a restaurant has pictures of the food on the menu I become suspicious (think of Dennys and Village Inn), but here the photographs are not indicative of anything bad. In fact, the food looks good. Did I mention the curry is really good."
4,"Monday... BIG screen football, volume up, dont come here Mon night if you dont want to be immersed in football. $5 burgers that are reg $10, combined that with happy hour deals 4-7 pm every day of delicious GOOD drafts for just a bit over $3 & all flatbreads & apps 1/2 price. At normal prices I would feel more 3-star. But if you know what you are getting into & come for deals, it is great for what it is. Waiter was VERY knowledgeable of menu, helpful with suggestions.   Atmosphere really is great with the dark wood ceilings to floors, big place but broken up with all sorts of nooks, interesting apothecary stuff Apollo over in cabinets, with Seattle Seahawks stuff thrown in."
4,"Eaten here a few times. Just finished lunch and had a great salad & sandwich. The salad I had was the spinach with poached egg, it was awesome. My taste is for savory, ""umami"", this was perfect with the egg bacon and light dressing. The chicken sandwich was good with basil and brie. Then the creme brulee with tahitian vanilla was great. Just a nice quaint place to sit outside and have a good lunch. One problem I have with Zinc Bistro is that they have Stella on tap, great right? But for $7! Thats one for $7. Come on, maybe $4. I just bought 12 for $10 at Total Wine."
5,"Mister Softee is an all-star, he showed up on time, provided great service, and has great tasting ice cream... Give him a call !!"
4,"Yolis has recently been popping up on Yelps Best Of front page. Many people are mouthing out and as the food whore that I am, I needed to go out and try it for myself. My previous research told me that there were many 5 stars and 3 stars reviews regarding the ambiance, service and food. It seemed that the place had be 5-stars for a while but trending analysis showed a decline in the late 2011- early 2012. Alright enough nerd talk-  it was a Saturday morning, I was starving and I needed a place to have brunch with my lady friend in town. When it comes to brunch at Yolis, you really need to leave all your expectations at the door. The neighborhood its in is a little sub-par, the parking situation isnt grand and the interior and patio decor resembles a home that stopped paying for landscaping services a long time ago. The tables outside are all basic basic plastic, they are not squeaky clean (or perfectly leveled) and the seating is pretty limited. If you are coming to Yolis, you are coming here for the food and nothing else, this aint no brunch at the Four Seasons. Their menus are strictly breakfast/brunch related but at a 2-sided page list, their breakfast choices do have a large variety of flavors and prices. The food is on the stealthier side with skillet dishes, omelets and diner-style potato sides. My friend and I ordered their most popular dish, the El Monte- Hawaiian french toast sandwich filled with egg whites, turkey, bacon and cheese with a spicy orange marmalade. At about $7, the sandwich was pretty large and filled me up easily after just half of it. The french toast itself was soft and spongy and the bacon had some crisp, but the turkey was very thinly-sliced deli meat so it didnt have a lot of flavor and the spicy marmalade was tasty but not spicy at all. The service was a tad slow but the lady was very very courteous and nice to us, she just didnt stop by very often so we had to wait around for our drinks and our check for quite a while. Overall I wasnt blown away with Yolis but I would recommend as a place with decent portions and good prices. As of now, a 3.75 stars on my book. I am a big supporter of local restaurants and I love seeing a family-owned business thrive. With a little bit more decor, faster service and a cleaner environment this place can return to be the GEM that people used to talk about. Yoli, if you are reading this- I hope you take this advice, we all want to see you succeed so we hope you can get back on that horse and impress the hell out of us. Good Luck!!"
2,"Not bad, but not great.  Service was really friendly, and prompt.  Food was ""meh"", maybe I just ordered the wrong thing."
4,"Economical discount theater!  For the price of what other theaters charge just for admission, you can get your popcorn and drink too!  Seats are a little small, but there are usually plenty of them.  It is of course not the newest releases, but I am never up to date on my movie watching anyway.  Must have cash, ATM available in the lobby area."
5,"The Valley Beer Drinkers Meetup Group has been coming here for months - since before the name change - on occasional Wednesdays for $3 craft pints & the fantastic wings special. Weve always had a good experience, and the extensive, rotating brew selection keeps the venue fresh. Ive been urging the owner to add at least ONE Pilsner to the IPA-heavy menu, and last night he delivered with a quintessential model: Munchener Spaten Pils! It was great. Adding to the experience was the excellent food. Portions were generous and satisfying!. One member ordered the Fish & Onion Rings, and when it arrived, two others immediately ordered their own! I cant remember better fish (pollack here) or more perfect onion rings! Homemade potato chips were remarkable, and the fry cook definitely knows the craft! Diners have many options for sides w/ entrees, which is a generous touch. Only the cole slaw was a bit bland.  Service was friendly & generally good, but not attentive enough later in the meal. Thanks for separate checks, too. I really look forward to returning for brews and to further explore the enticing menu!"
5,"Dude...a happy hour that is TRULY happy!!!   This joint is relatively swank for all the deals it has.  Nice decor, good bar, FRESH seafood (seriously...this is some good quality).  Starting at 4:00 p.m., they have $5 martinis AND $0.75 oysters.  YUM! On top of that, they offer discounts on other appetizers such as the bread and cheese plate, a GIANT crab cake, a salads, and shrimp dishes.  All are tasty. For all the Zoners out there (yeah, I said it), you have to check out this place.  You will have a great time!  NOTE - beware of dirty old men.  Theyll hit on your friends!"
5,"I loved this casual dining experience at the gorgeous Phoenician.  I stopped in for happy hour with some friends, and we had a great time.  We sat in front of the fireplace and sipped beers over appetizers.  The location alone is worth going for, but the food was good and service was even better."
4,"I have not been to the Outback in years as past visits have, well, sucked. I am not one to complain, I just never go back if I have a bad experience or two. Seriously, there are too many good places to go out to eat to return to business who dont focus on their food.  So my boss loves this place and she wanted to go and of course as she is the boss I agreed to return to the Outback with her.  I have to admit this place has changed. Our server, Bree, was excellent! A server can make or break your meal and Bree was on her game.  The food was really good, OK, I am super picky and was ready to hate it as I have in the past but tonight was different. I ordered the teriaki marinated sirloin. It came perfectly cooked at medium with sweet potato, salad and bread all for $12.95.  Maybe I got lucky and came here on a good night but I am glad I did and will definitely return."
5,"Bison Witches is a bit religious for me.  The hearth is in Tucson, but they did a good job of transplanting the same food experience to Tempe. Their filling sandwiches offer a sort of primitive bliss with the roughly-cut thick slices of bread - best tip is to go with the half sandwich/half soup (their half is really a whole) - Their chili is the best thing going..."
5,"I am always comfortable in Michelinas, the service is excellent and they are not rushing you to ""turn the table"".  Michelinas cooking is fantastic!  Her daily specials are so inviting that I rarely order from the menu.  The drinks are excellent, bread just right, and the after dinner complimentary cordial is a nice finish.  One of the best kept secrets in Phoenix!"
4,"I was out shopping with my 16 year old son, and we decided to stop in and try Americas. The delightful young lady behind the counter highly suggested that we try at least one thing with the pastor filling so we ordered the meal for two for $20. That comes with chips and salsa, two burritos, two tacos and two drinks The carne asada was very good...but OMG...the pastor was amazing! We just wished we had ordered the burrito with the pastor and the taco with the carne asada instead of the other way around. The sweet young thing kept checking in on us...we were there at 3 in the afternoon so it was quiet...but gosh, the young girls had just been fawning over us all day! On the way home, I looked at my kiddo and realized hes pretty darn good looking...so maybe that explains all the delightful customer service that day! Anyway, I can understand some of the complaints about it being a little pricey, but I think you are really getting a quality product and that is worth it to me. Plus, I thought the burrito was especially meaty. And as a carnivore I totally appreciate getting my meat on! Cute place, yummy food, fun day out with the teenager. Really, you cant ask for more than that."
5,Of course it gets hot in the summer. Youre going to be watching bands in a basement with a bunch of people and depending on when / whats going on there might be some idiots mawshing.  Sound quality is great for the size. Glad they reopened one of my favorite venues. and YES everybody has gotten lost the first time they tried to find the Nile. The main & front room have shows as well.
5,"Just went for my first time last night with ""the ""girls"". Two of us heard about it and after I read the reviews and checked out the menu it was slated for our next night out. Anyway we had a memorable evening with wine, the make-your-own cheeseboard and the to-die-for pear and gorganzola flatbread pizza. It was topped with fried sage leaves -- different and delicious. Afterward we were able to fit dessert and shared a huge slice of fresh layer cake filled and frosted with dark chocolate. Sublime! Cant wait to go back and try other dishes - definitely made it to my Restaurants to Frequent list :)"
2,This place is so so.  Ok food.  Ok atmosphere.  Just a decent restaurant in Buckeye.
5,"Best and most helpful hardware store I have visited. Thank God I live almost across the street! After many, many home projects and recently rebuilding my kitchen, I have frequented this Ace almost more times than I should. But I am always pleased at how quickly and smoothly my searches at this Ace are. Try it, youll like it!"
4,"Picazzos pizza is excellente!  My wife and I were told about this little pizza place by a friend who swore by it, so we decided to try it out. We are sooooo glad that we did because the food quality & taste was amazing. My wife loves it so much that when I asked her where she wanted to go for her birthday...Dr. Weils restaurant in Scottsdale or Picazzos....guess which one she chose? Picazzos FTW! The prices are a little on the high side, but I am a firm believer in the saying, ""you get what you pay for"" & this pizza place was worth every penny."
5,"Im currently staying at Camelback Inn for 3 days. A pleasant treat after a molar extraction last Friday afternoon. Although Ive sworn not to be seen in public with a swollen face, I am truly enjoying this trip. Theres a trail just behind this resort and a completely awesome view of the hills. Awesome and I mean it. My hubby is out on his meetings and Im juggling my work (the luxury of running your own biz, take it anywhere you want do it anytime you want, well not most of the time.. ).  Just had lunch at Hoppins Jack. Excellent service, friendly staff (especially the  handsome young german ;)). Anyway, ordered chicken sandwich with cashews and mandarin orange, delish. My lil girl was pacified with a vanilla sundae with fruity swirl (raspberry or is it strawberries?) with peaches and berries.. I had a few spoonful, yummy. Kids menu was dirt cheap, fries and 3 pieces of chicken strips or rather crispy chunks  was actully tasty. I still have until tomorrow. Maybe if I have time, Ill head down to the spa for a desert rain loofah. Oh, as for the room, great decor, quite spacious and an outdoor porch with umbrella and seat to lounge around in the sun. Simply love the view. It takes me away from everything. Im in heavenly desert.Highly recommended."
4,"I order the same thing at every Vietnamese restaurant. Rice Vermicelli Bun with Grilled Pork and Egg Roll, and spring rolls. This order does not change. Ever. They do the pork here more like a pork patty, or meatloaf if you will. In Vietnamese cuisine, there are two different ways to do it, the other being grilled slices of pork. I dont know which I prefer as they are very very different. You get a large amount of noodles, very fresh vegetables, and a generous portion of meat. The sauce is tasty, and everything seems very high quality. Spring rolls are good, as is the peanut sauce they serve them with. The service could be worse, but not much. Its pretty horrendous. Atmosphere is typical of a Vietnamese restaurant, total dive."
4,"My daughter and I sort of stumbled on this place a couple of weeks ago.  We were at the Ulta just around the corner and she said she was hungry and she LOVES pizza.  We have been here twice as of this writing.  The second time around was ""Kids Eat Free"" night.  That is Wednesay for those of you with kids and its a good deal.  I will eventually put together a list of Kids Eat Free places in the area.  For now let me tell you about NYPD..... The pizza is a winner!  Nice crust, great topppings!  They use paper thin slices of sausage instead of hunks of sausage.  The flavore is great too.  My daughter had a slice of black olive pizza and they were very generous with the olives....she loved it!  I have had the ceaser and the house salads and both were good and fresh.   So for the Kids Eat Free night adults need to order an entree (I think this includes a whole pizza too, not sure though) There were several things to choose from including cheese ravioli, baked ziti, and  lasagne.  I chose the lasagne and it was delish!  Piping hot with melted mozeralla over the top, I could not stop eating it!!  The flavors melded together nicely and it reminded me of my Moms lasagne.  And did I mention the bread......OMG!!  The little ibites of heaven are sooooo good!!  I could have eaten ten of them!!  They are homemade, the real deal, yeasty goodness!!  Warm and just a little chewy, the flavor was amazing!!   Oh and the Desert Flower Ice Tea.....so refreshing!!!  I keep thinking about it, thats how good it is!! Try the canollis.....you wont be disappointned.  Kids get an ice cream sundae with their meal.  On our first visit Lori, our server, was a real sweetheart.  She gave me some coupons and signed me up for the email list.  And on our next visit , Jessica was awesome and attentive too! This is a small place but they also have an outdoor patio with misters.  The bar is tiny, probably seats 10.  Flat screen for watching the Dbacks and some good beers on tap, along with Happy Hour specials makes this a great place!!  This will be somewhere we will frequent!!  Thanks NYPD!!!"
5,"5 stars for bein the only bar in Phoenix where I was first scared to order a drink. but- thats why I love this place. That, and its near the Trunk Space."
3,"I have been wanting to eat here since it opened and finally got the opportunity.  The ambiance and service is excellent, however that was not the reason why I was there.  I was there for the food that a lot of people have been raving about. I read somewhere that the hanger steak was their specialty and I dont disagree.  I had a taste and it was indeed very tasty.  And if I go back I will definitely get it.  And at under $20 it is a steal.  However, I ordered the 8oz filet for myself.  It was cooked properly and tasted good but not memorable.  The individual sauces that you can order on the side were also nothing special.  And yes, the fries were just as everyone on Yelp said they were; good but just like In-n-Outs, but cooked a bit longer.  The sides dishes were ok at best and were a bit on the smaller side.  However, the potato gratin was amazing and better than I have had at any steak place thus far. While it is less expensive than Mastros/City Hall, I think that for a few extra dollars it is worth going to a better place.  In my opinion, Mastros/City Hall have much better steaks and better/bigger side dishes.  However, J & G does have a better ambiance."
5,"This is one of my favorite theaters. With that said, I suggest you prepare yourself for having to wade through an onslaught of pre-teen cliques if you plan on making your way to the ticket counter on a Friday or Saturday evening. If youre like me, safety is a concern.  Not to worry here.  Ive always seen an officer on premises during the main drop-the-kids-off / pick-the-kids-up window. This location still has a new feeling to it, and it is clean and cool.  Nice cushy seats with cup holders, and I have yet to hear the soles of my shoes stick to the floor as I walk down an aisle. My favorite seats are the ones with the railing in front.  A place to perch my feet. -Swoop"
4,"Arrived at 4:30 and staked out our place in line for the 5pm opening.  There were quite a few people ahead of us so it was clear we would be in the second round of people.  Placed our name on the list and went next door for wine and apps.  The goat cheese crostini was excellent.  The wait staff was pleasant and kept us updated on the wait.  After an hour fifteen we were seat. Waiter was extremely pleasant. We started with the antipasto (wood roasted vegetables, Sopressata, Bite of Cheese) and then ordered 4 pizzas Margherita - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Basil topped with cremini mushrooms,  ROSA - Red Onion, Parmigiano Reggiano, Rosemary, AZ Pistachios WISEGUY - Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage and salami BIANCOVERDE - Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula and added Prosciutto di Parma (favorite) Service was great and the pizza well worth the wait"
3,"first time here and i wasnt all that impressed. lets just say i was afraid to ask my waitress when she was due.. but thats beside that point. bunch of tvs tho i had to squint to see whats going on. my eyes arent that great but whatever. it was a wednesday so they had margaritas and mexi beers on daily special, which varies. had 3 margaritas fairly fast. felt nearly nothing. weak as hell. i expected to half stumble out of the place but really i was fine. decent selection of wing flavors. which i might start seeing as a bad sign. tried the El Heffe wings. dry and dusty but a decent taste, with no real kick like it says, except maybe in the stomach itself. and the extra dollar for them? shouldve been a dollar less. cant screw up peanuts. the peanut shells on the floor novelty was probably the best part of the place, because you cant be that messy anywhere else but a baseball game. thats an extra star in itself.  the rest of the menu looked good so i may be back on a day with better drink specials and try something new to eat. ill update this shit if i do so......"
5,Thank you so much for the good reviews. I went here for a business meeting 8-13-2010. I ate soo much I hurt myself. Everything was great I especially loved the lamb and chicken curry. The staff was excellent and very kind. I will recommend my new favorite Indian food restaurant to everyone. ;)
5,"Ive been to this Dicks location a bunch of times and Ive got to say that Ive gotten more help from the employees in this one that Ive ever gotten from any other location. Ive spent some major time with the guys in the gun dept and theyre always more that helpful regardless of how busy and how many people they have waiting for them.  Major props to those guys for good knowledge and patience. Another time I was there I wanted some new shorts for softball and they didnt have and Ls left but jokingly I checked the Under Armour manikin as he was wearing the same shorts, and what do ya know... L.  It was near closing time and the associates were getting their stuff done so they could go home (Ive worked retail and I know at closing time you just want everybody to bail so you can clean and go home).  I asked a girl around the corner I was able to rob the manikin of his clothes and she laughed and had no problem taking him apart and yankin the shorts right off!  I was so happy as I had a game the next day and didnt want to be running around looking for these shorts. Think Im joking? lol - http://www.flickr.com/photos/ryno/4113416766/ Anyways - good store, always clean and everybody seems very nice and knowledgable in their area.  Never had an issue there."
3,Let me first say that this is a nice place. The Chips and Salsa were some of the best I have ever had.  My Wife and I both ordered Soft Shell ground beef tacos. The ingredients were great and everything tasted very good. However I would like to note that the tacos were swimming in grease. Overall It was one of the better places we ate in the phoenix area.
2,"Standard Burger King fare served at a snails pace.  One cook, one sandwich maker, one cashier, plus 30 people in the queue. Please help the economy and the waiting customers by hiring some staff!"
4,"The food is good quality. The atmosphere is nice. The owner and his wife work hard to make you feel welcome. Skip the chorizo gravy, everything else is a solid B."
3,Fancy  shop with great kitchen items that I would use for our kitchen.  It seems whenever I go in there their products dont work.  Avoid ordering any of their coffee pots because we had to return them twice in a row. It seems like whenever we walk in there the employees dont seem to be knowledgeable about the products there.  I give this store three stars for having a variety of kitchen items and an enchanting place to visit.
5,"I love the Tempe Library. The Culture Pass is a great program, the audiobook selection is good, and the seemingly unlimited resources are wonderful."
5,"Ive been a patient of Dr Lienaus since I was six years old!  I usually dont care who my primary care physician is, but when it comes to my dentist, theres no way in heck I would switch.  I even referred a co-worker to him recently!   Hes very honest, upfront, and has such a great support staff.  Colleen is the NICEST receptionist!  One of the hygienists has been there for years (I forgot her name!!) and is also a very friendly woman. I definitely recommend Dr Lienau!"
2,"My friends and I got a 10-person karaoke room and ordered food while we sang. The room is SMALL --in other K places Ive been to, that would have been a room for 5 people. With 10 people in there, we turned into a sweaty airless mess very quickly. Secondly, their song choices are not good. Theyre behind about 2 years. Had we known, we would not have gone there. The food was mediocre; Ive had better sushi. A room rental comes with a complimentary sushi platter, which was one roll (no idea what it was, even though i ate a piece); some edamame; two ribs. I ate the edamame; they werent cooked through because they were hard and had that slightly spicy raw taste.  We went on a Friday and it was packed to the gills with Scottsdale d-bags. At least the servers were very sweet, even though they messed up drink orders once and the bill once."
3,"Being the B, L, and D (breakfast, lunch and dinner) restaurant of a major valley resort takes allot of versatility. From scrambling eggs to grilling a piece of meat the new Ricos American Grill at the Point Hilton Squaw Peak Resort shows that all this can be done and more on a daily basis.  With two massive patios, a large bar and lounge area coupled with a fantastic selection of locally made beers on tap, just beckons you to try them all out. This is easily done by ordering up a Beer Flight ($7) which gets you 4 5oz glasses of their best brews, though this will be tough to chose, theyre all good. Then you can order a capped 64oz growler ($20) to go! A growler is simply a large glass jug filled with your favorite beer, your choice. These are all the rage in other cities so I was excited to see Ricos making this offer. Id fill it with my latest favorite, Left Hand Milk Stout Sweet Stout. Think rich flavors of chocolate and coffee blended with milk sugars to give a sweet and creamy taste.  In the large dining room youll notice a wood fired oven. Unfortunately Ricos doesnt take full advantage of this, only offering a handful of menu items cooked in it including the BBQ Chicken Flatbread ($12). Covered with pulled chicken, red onions, Ricos BBQ sauce and mozzarella, this paired well with our beers though could have used a bit more salt, easily remedied. Another glimmer of what could be was the Wood Oven Baked Penne ($13). Several large meatballs, roasted tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella and pesto ricotta cheese and al dente pasta made for a hearty satisfying meal.  A bit lighter but bold with flavor, the Chopped Salad ($10, add grilled chicken $3) made with grilled corn, black beans, bacon, tomatoes, cucumber, avocado, and BBQ-ranch dressing was shaken, not stirred, literally. The salad is brought out in a large martini shaker, dressing added on the spot then shaken well. Kind of a neat twist on table-side salad service, whats old is new again.  The Wicked Meatloaf ($15) could have used some of Ricos BBQ sauce for a sweet contrast instead of the semi-boring-more-like-brown-gravy cracked pepper demi. The meaty slabs were paired up with roasted garlic mashed potatoes that were well seasoned and comforting.    Perfectly cooked and perfectly tender, the New York Strip Steak ($21) had a warm poblano and bacon relish that I could have eaten by the spoonful. The smoky sweet relish made the need for any sort of steak sauce not necessary. Along side was a heaping helping of green chile mac n cheese, so creamy and so gone, delish.  Apple Skillet For 2 ($7) takes apple slices simmered in a brown sugar and cinnamon, thanks to the wood-burning oven, then topped with cake crumbles and served with cinnamon vanilla gelato. If the skillet werent so hot I would have licked it clean.  While Ricos may not have yet achieved culinary greatness, what you do get is solid Southwestern influenced American grub."
4,"This is a great place for grilled cheese and tomato soup.  They also have a great selection of beers on tap.  Parking is hit or miss, but you cant miss a cute house that has been converted to a great gastropub.  Always a friendly face and you will always run into good folks."
5,Agree with the previous review. Something nice about this super target.  Leaving a review to back up the other!! My only gripe is I spend to much at Targer. Or my wife does anyway!!!
1,"Had some time to kill before the Ultimate pleY Date Yelp event, and Id wanted to share my love of Nobuos Dark chocolate mousse with green tea ice cream and sugared orange peels with my happy-go-lucky cousin, who has never been here before, so we stopped by at 5:17p to find that Nobuo wouldnt open till 5:30p, so we waited outside in the comfortable patio. After watching a couple of employees add lanterns to their outdoor umbrellaed tables, I noticed the ""OPEN"" sign on the front door, so we entered the resto, whereupon we were greeted warmly by a male host and shown to a two-top.  I didnt like the energy in that room, so I asked if we could sit elsewhere, and he said to choose wherever we wanted to sit.  We were the first customers, so we chose a four-top, knowing we wouldnt be taking up space for very long, anyway.  Glasses of water were delivered, and soon we met our female server (whose name on the receipt reflected ""Butai"").  When she laid down the menus, I told her we would only be having dessert and could we see the dessert menu?  I wished we had a video of the look she gave us, a look of pure distaste, as she gathered up the dinner and beverage menus and said ""We dont have dessert menus, as we only have two..."" and proceeded to tell us of the mousse and the almond-orange fritters.  She walked away, and as we loudly discussed about our losing our interest in dining there, she came back with napkins and utensils and asked if we decided what we were going to have.  I decided to forgo our servers very cold treatment and asked for the mousse.  After all, Id already finished a glass of ice-cold water and cousins phone needed recharging...   When Butai placed our chocolate mousse http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg#rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg on the table, I wanted to send it back.  Where was the lovely bowl and presentation of the last dessert I had here?  Was she serious in presenting us with this stale-looking mousse, with cracked edges and whose green tea ice cream had ice crystals on it?  I dont know about you, but the only times Ive seen crystals on ice cream is when it has slightly melted and placed back in the freezer to re-freeze.  For me, seeing crystals on ice cream is a sign that it is old...  I brought the receptacle and showed it to the male host, who assured me that all of the mousse is made daily at 4:00a and seeing cracks and bubbles in the mousse is normal, so I decided we would go ahead and try it, if for nothing else but to have something to report here.  The dessert was definitely not up to par with the pretty bowl http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ#o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ I had during our October OYE in taste and presentation, but it was OK.  The mousse was still cold and stiff, and it had a mouth-feel more of like thick chocolate ganache filling/icing on a cake- certainly not the silky-smooth chocolate decadence I knew it could be.  My cousin had to warm up to the dish, as the sound of chocolate and green tea together didnt seem like a great combo to her (I told her to trust me).  She also never enjoyed orange and chocolate together, but she liked it in this dessert.   I understand that the knowledge of having to serve only dessert instead of dinner AND dessert, which translates to a higher table bill, can be a bit of a disappointment, but why must you show your displeasure to your guests?  Butai, you were lucky that my cousin even left you the change for a tip- she didnt want to give you anything, and you certainly didnt deserve it!  When I told other Yelp friends about the sub-par service and dessert we just had, one replied she didnt enjoy the last time we had apps here (I think it was around Halloween and First Friday?) either.  Cousin and I thought it very poor taste that our server gave us that awful, condescending look after finding out we were just going to have dessert; We didnt deserve that!  I am never going to recommend Nobuo to anyone, anymore.  I even promised my Japanese friend (who lives and works overseas) Id treat her to a dining experience here when she comes to visit.  Guess Ill have to find another place to take her...  I dont want to risk getting the same treatment from Butai, or from another server should we come back here.   Sorry, Nobuo, but I wont be returning."
1,"After repeat visits it just gets worse - the service, that is.  It was as if we were held hostage and could not leave for a full 25 minutes because thats how long it took to receive hour check after several requests to several different employees.  Female servers might be somewhat cute but know absolutely nothing about beer and this is a brewpub.  I asked if they have an seasonal beers and the reply was no, that they only sell their own beers!  Even more amusing is their ""industrial pale ale"" is an IPA but it is not bitter.  So, they say its an IPA but its not bitter, its not a true-to-style IPA.  Then people say ""Oh I dont like IPAs"" and want something else.  Their attempt to rename a beer/style is actually hurting them.  Amazing. The menu was not the regular menu, just a small list of about 4-5 choices.  To make it worse, the actual menu on every table was wrong, yet the kept the menus on the tables anyway.  I heard 3 separate tables order the fried raviolis but they did not have them.   This place is *only* in business because of the location, location, location."
2,"I wasnt that impressed.  The machines look old and rusted, there didnt seem to be any air-conditioning and it had to be in the 90s inside since it was about 110 outside.  They did have overhead fans.  The price was cheap--45 cents per load to wash in a top loader but we only found one top-loader available that actually worked.  Half of them were Out Of Order.  Instead we dumped everything into two front loaders that claimed to do double loads and were out of there in pretty short order.  We took the clothes back to my daughters apartment building to dry in the laundry room there so she didnt have to stay with them."
5,"I loved this place! A bit pricey, but excellent quality. Been here twice and havent had anything we didnt like. The meat is great quality and theyll cook it how you desire as opposed to places that wont cook something below medium well. Great toppings for burgers, fries and shakes. Although everything is so big and filling I certainly cant have all that in one trip! Definitely a decadent tasty treat."
3,"This place is a hoot! A friend wanted to go to a movie that had been out for a while and it turned out that it was only still playing at this theater and one other.  This is typically a $3 theater, we happened to go on a Tuesday and it turns out they have $2 Tuesday so it was even cheaper. You definitely get what you pay for...this theater has been around for a while but its a great deal compared to the average movie gong cost. The concessions are also reasonable cost. Not the most comfortable seats in the world but you get what you pay for. The reason this place is a hoot? There are crazy decorations, life size figurines, games, etc, everywhere. I am sure I only really saw about a third of the decorations because it is just sensory overload. I hear they really deck it out at Christmas. So if you are looking for an affordable movie night and dont mind the seats from 20+ years ago this is a good option."
4,"I love F&E. Been shopping at the 12th street location since it opened there doors. This store works best for me since I live a very busy lifestyle. The pre-packaged foods, fruits and veggies make life easier for me. For a small store they have a great variety of things to choose from. This is not a one stop shop to find everything, however they seem to always have the items that work best for me. They dont have as many Safeway or Frys grocery deals, but they have discounted items regulary to choose from. There prices are slightly higher then Trader Joes for the amount of food. The store is always neat and clean. There is tons of help incase you have guestions. You can bag your own or there is someone there to help you."
3,"The best place to skip work and goofy golf in the spring and summer. Sure, its a little musty, old, run-down... but its a slice of my childhood and at least its still here.  I cant gather the courage to ride the roller coaster anymore and bumper cars just arent as appealing as they once were but the two story arcade still makes me squeal a little. The golf is great too! I would suggest playing courses one through three. The last two times Ive been we played course four and three and four has the least amount of attractions. Courses one and two are busiest, so its a choice between being stuck behind a bunch of kids or some really un-fun holes. Oh, and they do have a black and white photo booth."
5,"You know the story about the cobbler who created all those adorable shoes for the elves in the village? Ok, so maybe that story doesnt go exactly like that. Regardless, I found Old Town Scottsdales version of the magical cobbler who can do wonders with shoes and I found it at Tonys Shoe Repair! Here, Tony keeps shoes in spic and span condition and if you bring them in looking anything but shiny and new, you can be sure they will be returned as good as new. Tonys Shoe Repair also handles purses and belts. They do everything for a shoe including simple repairs such as widening and adding those little tricky bottom parts of heels that never seem to last, to giving your worn our shoes an entire face lift. The prices here are reasonable and he does the work for you in a speedy time frame. I dropped off my sad looking boots off and he freshened them up and added new heel bottoms to them in a days time. The fairytales can keep their magical cobblers, here in the real world weve got something even better -- Tonys Shoe Repair!"
4,I really enjoy the food here. Great breakfast fare. Great prices. Great service. The pancakes are really good. I still wonder why people go to Dennys.  This is wayyyyyy better.
5,"When I was recovering from surgery, I received of one of their arrangements. It was marvelous. The quality was unbeatable, with gorgeous blooms and fantastic presentation. They lasted for weeks. I am really pleased with this company and wouldnt hesitate to use them again!"
5,Anyone who tells you this place isnt amazing is cu cu for coco puffs. The owners are equally amazing. They will remember you and tell you amazing stories and the cocktails are always amazing. My favorite is the lychejito made from lychee infused vodka made in house. The spring roll bar is amazing and they always change it up for me if I ask for substitutions. There really isnt anything on the menu that isnt good they offer everything from Vietnamese sammies to amazing clay pots. I always go for the soup but that hasnt stopped me from trying everything else. Everything is always fresh and delicious. Their happy hour is awesome as well.
3,"Read all the reviews on Yelp and thought I give Changs Chinese Buffet a try. With a 4 star rating, I was expecting 4 star quality food. Well, some of it was good, but some of it could be better. First of all the atmosphere was pretty nice. It almost felt like Cheers, where everyone knew your name. Even though we didnt know anyone there, everyone talked to one another. The T.V. in the corner drew most everyones attention. You could tell who the regulars were. They were up front and closest to the T.V.  Most of the food was fresh. The Shrimp was very fresh and tasty. The rice was also seasoned probably and tasted almost as good as back East Chinese food, it just wasnt brown. Orange chicken was good, but a little hard. Not as moist and juicing like I wanted. The chicken was dry. It was flavors well, but was dry inside. Seems like it was under the heating lamp too long. The sweet & sour soup was good, but Ive tasted much better. The egg drop soup wasnt too good though. Spare ribs werent bad. Also a little dry, but not as bad as the chicken. The Egg-foo-yung was not good. Hockey puck shaped or not, it was too watery and didnt taste like real Egg-foo-yung. Everything else was pretty average. For the price, it wasnt bad. I would go back and eat there just so I could have the rice and shrimp. So pretty much 2 stars for the food and 1 for the atmosphere, service and cleanliness. Place was very clean and service was decent. Not a 4 star restaurant. Barely a 3 star. I think my wife gave it 2 stars. If you go there and find certain foods you like, its probably worth the $5-$6 to go back and eat as much as you want of those particular foods. Skip the bad stuff and eat all of the good tasting foods. Other buffets will run you $10-$15, so this place could be a gem if the food gets better."
3,"Just returned from the Phoenix area and so my friend insisted we check this place out.  Well basically the place serves an alcoholic versions of ""Slurpees"" in a variety of flavors.  If youve been to Las Vegas its the same as those slushy alcoholic drinks but made in a small Arizona-sized portions. I was ok hanging out on the patio but I dont think I would trek here as my destination.  The prices were ok as well as the scene.  In fact we saw a table of 8 people apparently just walk out without paying their bill so we watched half of the staff burst out the door running in different directions trying to apprehend the suspects.  Weird huh?"
4,"Back to Joes.... been several years as we are Westside dewelers and on Mothers Day we had Mom & Dad with us and suggested Joes after the hot experience out at Schenpfs farm.  Glad we went, Joes really is quite tasty, is it the best? - Probably not but that is all relative!  For the SE Valley, its our go to spot for BBQ.  We had the ribs, pulled pork, the Jumbo tater with Pork, coleslaw, mac & Chz, lemon cake, sweet patato pie.  All were really quite tasty.  The ""HOT"" sauce isnt THAT hot... but good lil kick.  One time we will be there when its not as hot out and get to try that nice large outdoor seating!  - I gotta say the Lemon Cake kicks ass!"
4,"Always good pizza, close to home and they serve beer and wine.  Plus my kids can play video games and husband can watch the game."
1,"Surprised this place isnt closed by now. Went here once when I first started going to ASU and never came back. Their ingredients are not fresh, gyro meat tastes old and decrepit. They really need to hire better pita makers who dont resemble drug addicts and derelicts. My pita was falling apart before it was even handed to me. Literally, by the time I got it to the table it was soggy and not even worth eating!"
4,"Had the Korean Beef over white rice. What a great dish.  Thin sliced beef in a garlic brown sauce with onions and great taste, served with a side of white rice. NOTHING over the top nothing trying to be something it is not. Just good food."
5,"The first couple of times I ate here I wasnt sure why people were always so crazy for this place. Its been about two years since my last visit and in the past couple of months Ive already been here like three times and wanted to go back more. Ive decided that its all about what you order; for example the first time I went I probably felt overwhelmed with all the choices and decided to go for something really plain like turkey with hardly any toppings, have fun! Their menu has a wide variety of yummy sandwiches and lots of new tastes to try. Also, dont be afraid to speak up. I was a little disappointed by the lack of lettuce and veggies on one of my veggie sandwiches but I also didnt pay attention. Now I ask for lots of lettuce and theyre happy to make it the way I like. They make their breads fresh and they have garlic-herb bread that has lots of flavor. I wont order a sandwich from there without a side of ranch dressing. I am a picky ranch eater...I hate mayonnaise so I am always super careful that ranch doesnt taste or resemble mayo. I usually like restaurant mayo that is a little more runny in consistency with lots of flavor. They have the best home made ranch dressing here! Pair it with the garlic-herb bread and your sandwich is going to be booming in flavor. OMG! Wipe...sorry I just started to drool a bit. Service is good...everyone runs at the same chill pace which seems to go well with the theme of this restaurant. My current favorite is the Humboldt sandwich...I get the Pinner (8"") but I swear some days I am so hungry I think Im going to order the Blunt (12"")...maybe someday soon. All sandwiches get toasted. Okay so toppings: Guacamole, sprouts, lettuce/spring mix, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, black olives (I get mine w/o), cucumbers, pickles, your choice of cheese (I get Swiss), with their house goodies (EVOO, vinegar, herb mixture on top). Now that I found my sandwich, I crave it all the time and cant wait for my next visit. Oh, be sure to check their daily specials too! If youre lucky enough to be in their delivery area...well, darn you then! :-)"
3,"Probably more worthy of 3.5 stars.  Damn the Yelp constraints!  Marketplace was pretty busy tonight now that you can actually go out in the evening without a gentle breeze feeling more like a blow torch in your face.  In spite of that, our wait to be seated was fairly quick.  But where was our server?  Outside listening to the band?  We need liquid refreshment! Finally our server arrived and apologized for the wait at the same time the manager arrived and also apologized and comped us an appetizer.  Wow!  We hadnt even complained.  We had the hummus which was very tasty but a little thin and a mango tandoori chicken pizza.  Nice combination of sweet mango, spicy curry sauce, and the grilled chicken.  Service was excellent once we got over the initial bump. While I usually dont plan to go to CPK, its nice to know this one is there."
2,"I just cannot understand why this place is so highly rated. Could it be that people have never experienced barbeque outside of Arizona, so they have no basis of comparison? But even that cannot be true. We have Joes in Gilbert, and even Famous Daves is pretty darn good.  I work a block from this location, so I have been there at least a dozen times. While not great, it is something different once in awhile, so I put in an appearance now and then. The food is not bad, per se, it is just not that good. The prices, on the other hand, are far too high for what you get. $11 gets you a ""large sandwich"" which is not very large, an order of fries, and a soda--RC brands. For a couple of bucks more I could get a combo platter at Famous Daves.  Service is all business. I dont think I have ever seen a smile in the place. But it is fast. The place is usually dirty, but I am usually there right around lunch, so it might be better other times.  Just not impressed at all. But...it beats the Burger King down the street which is the worst BK in Christendom. But that is another review."
3,"Cave Creek is a well-manicured muni, featuring a straight-forward layout, nice practice area and large putting green.  There are some elevation changes and some bunkering that add some challenge, but overall its a pretty easy course. Some of the better holes are #5, a dogleg right with no room to drive it left (slopes into a hazard), and large green with some tricky pin positions if the flag is in the back.  #8 is a long par four with a narrow driving area and a challenging approach featuring a narrow chute to the green that will most likely need to be hit with a mid-to-long iron (#1 handicap).  #11 is a par 5 that forces you consider fairway metal off the tee, as a driver hit over 260 yds and to the right could likely find a water hazard, and anything left is completely dead.  My personal favorite hole is #18, a short four par with a carry over a ravine from the tee to an uphill, dogleg left fairway with a slope on the left side and a reachable fairway bunker.   Most of the greens here are fairly large, so lag putting will come into play.  There arent any tricks here - it can suit fairway-green style and the bomb-and-gouge crowd.  The driving range desperately needs new balls, but the course is a solid three stars."
4,Best Thai food Ive eaten in the Phoenix area.
5,"Hands down the best spa I have visited in the state and perhaps the nation.  Massages were amazing. Drinks and brunch were amazing. Staff went out of their way to take care of our every need. Went at 11 am to relax for the day and stayed until 5pm which is unheard of for me at a spa once the initial massage has taken place, but this place kept me going all afternoon with the plunge pool, sauna and steam. Also, the pool and spa hot tube outside were amazing. I honestly cannot say enough about AJi and its wonderful staff. I will return"
5,"Yes, the place is busy every time I go there, and it takes 20 minutes or so to get your order Yes, the inside is cheesy and cheap with folding tables and could definitely use a makeover Yes, the location is...ummm...well lets just say its a ""working class neighborhood"" BUT theyve got the best fish tacos Ive ever had, and everything on their Mexico City street food style menu is outstanding. The $1 tacos are ""mini-tacos"" so get 3 or 4 of them, a couple of fish tacos, maybe a side of rice and/or beans and you will be all set. Go there. Just leave yourself plenty of time, its well worth the wait."
1,"This is a sad excuse for a gay resort.  Sort of like a worn out version of Palm Springs.  We found the Zen Yard up on Maryland Avenue a much more agreeable experience in a better neighborhood as well.  Zen Yard is a far better value, with full breakfasts included and warm, helpful hosts as well, not to mention particularly reasonable off-season rates and hosts who are actually there for their guests."
4,"Im just glad that they brought back the Strawberry ""fields"" salad.  Yummo!  Fresh greens, goat cheese, fresh strawberries, bell peppers, onions, glazed pecans, chicken and this amazing viniagrette dressing! Wowwy Mowwy!  Oh, and it comes with a crusty buttery cheesy bread.  I have had a few run ins with bad waiter service, but the manager was always quick to come by our table to ask if anything else was needed.  As long as I get what I ordered and I dont have to poke around their tables to make ""eye contact"" with my server Im ok.  They know they will get a mideocre tip if their service is so-so.  Its on them.  My mother got a red velvet cupcake on the house for her birthday! That was nice."
5,"I never write these things. But I have to say that you will not be disappointed with Paletas Betty. Especially with the weather right now, it is a delicious and healthy treat, made with seasonal ingredients. I highly recommend the limón amarillo when in season. Delicious frozen lemondade/lemon drop on a stick, tossed in a sugar rub. It is for certain served in heaven. That is all. P.S. check out the hours, yo. You know whats up."
5,"Quick, friendly, awesome."
5,"Amazing. Fogo de chao is nothing short of out of this world. It is expensive, but as soon as you start, youll know exactly where that money went. Seriously. Try it."
5,"Ever eat at a Steak n Shake?  Thats what Freddys is: a Steak N Shake kind of burger and its delicious!  I liked the fries too: very thin, perfectly hot, not too much salt. Nice people, the manager made it a point to get me my meal hot-off-the-grill, even though I came ahead of the ""call"" and again he met me while he was cleaning tables.  {See my review of ""The Habit"": their manager never greets customers, cant solve problems from behind a door, always hiding in his office.}  Freddys Manager was OUTFRONT, ALL THE TIME, WORKING HARD!   Great burger.  Next time Ill get the frozen custard.  I was too full from my triple cheese, CALIFORNIA STYLE-BABY!"
5,"had a ""cap steak"" for the first time. Best steak i have ever had.  Would recommend to anyone."
2,"Im always searching for quality food at a fair price for lunch.  There are tons of sit down expensive lunch places and lots of fast food (junk food) places too.  When I read the reviews on Chestnut Lane I hustled right on over.  The concept is right on but the execution leaves a LOT to be desired.   First challenge is getting a parking place and I was lucky.  The line to order didnt look too bad when I arrived so i was feeling lucky.  However, the line took forever to move forward causing the people waiting to shuffle back and forth in a very confined space as there was lots of foot traffic trying to enter and exit.  The woman at the register took each order, processed the payment, and then proceeded to prepare the drinks  and sides for each order.  The drinks are somewhat specialty items and are kind of labor intensive, especially considering that the order line is at a total standstill.  SLOW!  After way too long a wait, I finally was able to order...then the real wait began!  It was a good 25 minutes before my order came up and it was just a TURKEY SANDWICH!  I felt lucky, though, as the woman ahead of me in line was still waiting for her SANDWICH after I had finished mine and was driving away! Sometimes a long wait is mitigated by the awesomeness of the food.  Well, at Chestnut Lane this is unfortunately not the case.  I mean it was a decent turkey sandwich, but when I saw the almost $16 charge for a TURKEY SANDWICH and ICED TEA I was expecting something fabulous.  It wasnt all that.   If you decide to go to Chestnut Lane, maybe you could park in the spacious Jack-in-the Box lot just to the east.  And grab a Breakfast Jack to hold you over during your long wait!"
3,"After checking into our lovely suite at the Montelucia my hubby said he was in the mood for some chips, guac and a margarita. I think he had mistaken Scottsdale for Mexico and unfortunately the restaurant at The Montelucia (Prado) had none of the above. Instead we enjoyed a glass of wine (Riesling for me), a bowl of gazpacho and shared the snapper ceviche.  Service was a bit on the slow side, but the tasty food made up for it... We ended up back at Prado the next morning for breakfast- we were quite starving after hiking Camelback (or part of Camelback).  I was a bit disappointed with their breakfast menu. They had very few things to choose from besides the $25 breakfast buffet. I wasnt in a buffet kind of mood, but it didnt seem like we had a choice. However, I seemed to get the most out of my $25 after stuffing my face with an omlette, mini breakfast burrito, fruit, yogurt parfait, etc.  Our waiter did a bit of a disappearing act, but fortunately we didnt need him much for the buffet. They do have some good food, but they could use some more options...and better service."
4,"Ive been to corporate events, concerts and Spring Training games here, and Ive been consistently surprised at how well they do what they do.   First the field.  At Spring training games you are so close you feel like youre watching a little league game.  The grass is go green it almost looks fake (its not).  And the backdrop of office and apartment buildings is decidedly suburban.  I finally get the big draw.   Next - the vendors. Taco in a bag (must experience to believe).  Strawberries and banana dipped in chocolate on a stick.  Great pizza.  Amazing choices of beer.  Oh, if only they had a selection of soda the way they had a selection of beer.   Parking is plentiful and the grounds are always kept neat.  Folks who work there have all been helpful and friendly.  It may feel like its forever away from our Phoenix core, but its not to far for an experience that BOB or Chase Field could never provide."
5,This place is so good! I have eaten almost everything on the menu. It is not the fanciest of places but it is great to go with friends and buy a ton of delicious food for very little money. I would recommend this place I go often.
4,"Always packed on wing night, which can sometimes make for slow service, but that is to be expected. I love their wings, even if they are kind of small, but who can complain for $0.39? Pizza is good too. And the pizza cookie dessert, omg, druelz."
3,"Wow, it must be a first-time mall experience for the reviewer before me.  Five stars for Arrowhead?  Are you kidding? I find this mall to be average and boring with many middle of the road stores (Dillards, Sears, Gap, Tillys, Forever 21) you can find elsewhere at other Westcor malls in the Valley.    Nothing really strikes me as distinctive at this mall - other than the fact that its the nicer of two indoor shopping malls on the Westside.  So for 500,000 people this is the only game in town unless theyre willing to drive east. The store mix and food court are pretty typical.  In fact, I rarely go here unless I am in the area, need socks or undershirts and/or Im trying to avoid the lines of the other Arrowhead Paradise Bakery."
5,"Mmm!  Delicious Indian food and a great selection of vegetarian dishes. I LOVE the fact that each dish is mildly spiced, and left up to the individual to customize the flavor depending on which sauces they choose.  Im a spicy lightweight so it was great that I didnt have to worry about getting something too hot to enjoy. I had a bowl of brown rice, cumin potatoes and tofu masala with a cool yogurt-cucumber-mint sauce on the side.  It was fantastic!  I cant wait to go back. ...also, I thought it was adorable that we were given a golden dollar coin with our check for ""making the drive to their location and to compensate for high-gas prices"".  A memorable gesture!"
4,"I always have good time at this place.  I could write a page about Geisha, but the previous reviews pretty much sum this place up.       *   Self servicing bathrooms (Ladies only)      *   Fantastic Happy Hour pricing- The veggie pot stickers are the bomb!     *   Hot waitresses ... barely of age to serve you alcohol =)     *   Private karaoke rooms that allow you to humiliate yourself in front of your friends only The only thing I would steer clear of is the specialty drinks they are overly sweet and are not made with fresh fruit... even when they say they are. The waitress cleared that up for me last weekend =)."
3,"A group of us were there for drinks late Saturday night, the bar is really cool, well thought out and decorated. Drink menu, cocktails and draft beers are all exceptional. Only challenge was it was almost impossible to get the attention of the bar staff, I am not sure that since we were a large group and had a tab running that only one batman could serve us but it was really frustrating having bar staff just ignore us! Other wise the place is great........"
3,"tip: if ordering in the drive thru - either there is no speaker system or its out of order - when the person wearing an apron walks up to the side of the menu and stares into your car that means ""Hi, can I take your order"" There was a few seconds of awkward silence and wondering WTH this person was looking in the car for before we figured out she was there to take our order :) Since moving to the west valley from southern CA weve been itchin to find a replacement for Albertos or Taco San Pedro. Humbertos reminds me of awesome hole in the wall type Mexican food, but unfortunately still leaves something to be desired. With that said heres info on what we had: If youre from So Cal and have had Northgates shrimp ceviche Humbertos comes awfully close.  Verdict - Ceviche - good. Cheese quesadilla - cheesy - did the job Nachos - good If youve been out late partying it up and need to satisfy the munchies monster Humbertos should do."
3,"Its an upscale casual restaurant with nice decor- 4 star, a quick meal before or after shopping. A quick meal means only if you get good sever plus quick service. We went to have brunch on Sunday and it was pretty packed in there. After looked at their simple brunch menu, we decided to get Grilled Hanger Steak with Scrambled Eggs, and Cinnamon French Toast with Fruit Compote & Syrup($8.50).  It wasnt too impressive, the food was just ok- 3 Star. I think you pay more for the ambiance than the dishes. The service was alright- 3 Star. It felt like you are in the market with chit chat and bargain noise, which i thought it was kinda annoying."
4,"I eat lunch here sometimes.  The chips are always a little on the burned side and need tons of salt.  Ive learned from experience that this just goes better with the salsa there.  Besides, these chips are real.  Not some gigantic bag of factory chips laying on some heating tray in the back.  They killed those tortillas this morning, in boiling oil.  Seriously, the first bite not capture your imagination but youll slowly find yourself wondering why you cant stop eating them. They have daily specials, my favorite of which is the chicken mole which is Thursdays I believe.  Im also a sucker for Fridays chille relleno.  If Im there on some other less glorious day, Ill opt for the cheese enchilada plate or the Clare burro.  Try the ice tea.  Its got cinnamon in it and it doesnt taste a thing like Liptons."
5,"I love the story time program here! I started coming this summer after having a baby and wanting to get my toddler out of the house while beating the heat. The staff here is amazing! It is a 30 minute session of singing, dancing, stories and bubbles. We look forward to this every week now. My daughter loves the take home cut out and coloring sheet. The first thing she does is come home and color it. I am so thankful for this free program."
1,"I havent yelped in about 2 months, and I was waiting for a place to either wow me or disgust me.  Well, this place was that bad.  First impressions were all right -- the outside bar was neat w/ good views of downtown, and the fire pits were nice.  No beers on tap though; and seriously, whats with the hip-hop club DJ at 7:00 pm?  Come on guys, way too early for that. It wasnt too long before three of us were seated; and after about 10 minutes, our waitress came up and asked us whether we were ready to ... oh wait, thats right, no menus yet, good job.  O.k., so I ordered the Thai Spring rolls, which had a filling of lettuce, a single strip of carrot, and noodles.  Seriously?!  Main course, I ordered the curry, which turned out to be the worst curry in the world -- I dont even know if it was curry; it was more like a bowl of thick, yellow soup, with a few pieces of chicken and a couple of vegetables tossed in.  Yuck.  And then they only gave me a tiny bowl of rice.  Im sorry, isnt it supposed to be the other way around?  My friends completely agreed with how bad the place was (I think they had some sort of stir fry, which they said was bland and pointless). So yeah, I dont recommend this place.  Instead, head a block over to The Roosevelt for some good beer on tap and some pretty good food."
4,"I usually try to stay away from the Arizona Mills mall. The mall itself has gotten crappier by the minute. Now, since I work close by, I was forced to go back to venture to Paradise Bakery. I honestly did not get my hopes up. Since it was lunch time, it was not busy at all. Nothing is worse that being on your work lunch, starving, and standing in line. I opted for the Chicken Walnut Sandwich, with a cup of Tomato Soup.  The sandwich was delicious and fresh. The bread was perfect as was the chicken walnut salad. You know...sometimes chicken salad can get really gross..slimey..salty...yucky. This one was perfect and the walnuts added a delicious crunch. On to the soup. First off, I L-O-V-E tomato soup. It is my favorite. Would almost consider taking a bath in it. Hehehe...well, ok maybe not. BUT this soup rocked my socks off. Perfectly creamy, with a hint of smoky flavor, a small drizzle of sour cream and a few crunchy tortilla strips. YUM. So, venture there to try the soup but scurry fast and take the food with you. Dont eat there. Take it somewhere, where you can have a moment alone with the soup.  Finito."
5,"Best cajun food in town, not just from a truck.  Phoenix doesnt have the greatest selection of cajun offerings so I was amazed at Food Truck Friday to find Jamburrito.  They have a pretty stellar selection of meats & meals considering its from a truck. The spices were perfect - just spicy enough to enjoy but nothing thats going to harm.  I had the catfish once and the jamburrito twice... not in one sitting because the portions are VERY filling."
5,"first time my friend and I went there... it was delicious!  The food, garlic knots our favorite and of course the wine!  We will be going back ALOT!"
5,"First off, I am not a Cubs fan.  But I came here to watch them play the As during spring training and thought this park rocked.  Its cozy enough get within heckling distance of the players, but it has a lot of the amenities of Wrigley Field...including Old Style beer and florescent green hot dog relish.  All this and sunshine too!  Whats not to like?"
4,"This should be called a speakeasy coffee shop. Why? Because you really have to be told about it to really know its there! The shop has minimal signage on the exterior and its housed within a urban multi-use warehouse on Roosevelt with different vendors and an art space. I can only imagine how cool this building must be to visit during First Fridays! Once inside, I was pretty surprised that the coffee shop is more spacious than I would have figured. Its pretty sparse inside, but there were plenty of seats to do some work or have a meeting.  The coffee here is strong and delicious. After drinking my non-fat iced latte, I had to refrain myself from bouncing off the walls! Its definitely coffee with a kick if you need a wake-up call.  This coffee shop definitely exudes the epitome of cool and I will definitely keep it on my list for a caffeinated visit in the future."
4,"My boyfriend and I came here this past Friday night for dinner as we had both drive by the place quite often and have been wanting to try it out.  The service was great and I liked the wide open space. We tried two different beer samples for a $1 each and settled on splitting a pitcher of Levitation which we both enjoyed. We ordered the green chile dip appetizer. I ordered the shrimp tacos and my boyfriend ordered the brisket. He LOVED the brisket and after taking a bite of it, I could see why. It was quite good. My shrimp tacos however, were so bland that I barely ate half of my meal. And it was a ""small plate."" I wasnt the biggest fan of our appetizer but after tasting my dinner, I decided I liked the dip a lot more and finished it off. Definitely do not recommend the shrimp tacos. One annoying thing was our meals came out right after our appetizer. A little time in between would have been good - but Ill take that over slow service any day.  Im giving this place four stars because of how great the brisket was and despite not liking my dish, I had a great time and think this place has lots of potential. Ill be back to try something else!"
4,"Aww, too bad these guys went out of business.  I actually only went there one time, I live in Chandler, so its just a little out of the way.  But I stopped through the drive-thru and thought if I lived near-by this would be my coffee place.  Whoever took my order that day was very friendly."
3,"I think the Living Room is fine! Like another reviewer said, its nothing particularly exciting or mind blowing, but it is a nice neighborhood restaurant that has solid food. I like some of their bruschetta options more than Postinos.  I do agree that the music is too loud! The atmosphere is more ambient and I wish the music was commensurate with that. I always forget my servers name but he is very nice and helpful - no complaints there!"
4,"I give Rivas 4 stars because of the secret top burrito in town which is the California burrito and have them put a chilli relleno in the burrito which is the best of all worlds.  So basically this burrito consists of carne asada, potatoes, pico de gallo, cheese and a chilli relleno all wrapped up in a delicious tortilla.  Once you add some hot sauce to that it equals one of the best burritos in town.  I learned of this only because of one of the employees telling me to get it this way because all the people that work there eat it this way.  You have to try it!"
4,"We got passes for the preview of Mission Impossible (Ghost Protocol).  We enjoyed the movie a lot.  The theater itself is fine.  The chairs dont move, and you cant raise the arm rests.  No rocking, no reclining (granted most theater seats dont move a lot, but these dont move at all).  Otherwise the seats were reasonably comfortable.  The screen is IMAX (i.e. huge), and the sound was reasonably good.   They could have put a little more slope into the auditorium seating.  In other IMAX theaters Ive been in it seemed the heads of people in front of you NEVER block any portion of the screen.  But I found a few were just slightly into the bottom of the screen.  It wasnt bad, but given my other IMAX experiences I did notice it."
5,"Having spent lots of time in Sonora, Mexico over the years visiting family, I have always sought a place here in Arizona that provides an honest and quality duplication of the food I have had south of the border. At Sonora Mesquite Grill, I have found such a place that makes food on the spot, using only fresh ingredients, and genuine care for your experience. You can always go elsewhere and maybe get your food faster, maybe have a plasma TV in your face, but Im willing to bet that your food started out frozen and going through a thawing process in a microwave.  Celina, the kind and welcoming owner, wants people to receive the absolute best food possible. This painstaking process means long hours for her every day preparing the beef and chicken over a mesquite fire. No, there are no large corporate chain gimmicks or cut corners. Sonora Mesquite Grill simply provides good food at a good price without the use of preservatives and loads of fat. Is Sonora Mesquite Grill for everyone? Perhaps not, but it is a great choice for someone looking for genuinely authentic, modest, great tasting and healthy food with the taste of Sonora.  If going for the first time, make sure to order the silky and flavorful guacamole and salsas. Finish your meal with a fresh and homemade razpado to truly cap off a great meal at Sonora Mesquite Grill. Simple and great flavors at their very best."
4,"If its cold, creamy ,sweet, and I can put many a topping of choice on it and its fat free and low calories, Im all in. Golden spoon is this and more. Simply delicious flavors and all around good. Need I say more?"
2,"Been to this place only once.  Coming from Chicago the experience at this place was ok, but Ive had much better.  Would not go again since I think there are better places out here."
4,"Great food and atmosphere. Had lunch there on a Friday afternoon. Parking is a bit of a challenge. Had the pork pita which had onions, bell peppers, and pepper jack cheese...awesome... The burgers are good too! The service was excellent."
5,"Mouth watering. Thats all I have to say. The food at this place is seriously amazing. Everything we tasted was better than the dish before it, and we had a fabulous bottle of white wine to accompany our meal. The scallops were a highlight, as was the potato pie dish (thats not a very technical name for what it was, but thats my best effort). It was all very, very good, and the only thing keeping us from returning is the cost! We genuinely enjoyed our evening here, and we will absolutely go back, but it is pricey, especially for the size of the dishes. The atmosphere and ambiance are so fun, and this place is a little dressier and trendier than some other places weve been in Scottsdale. I highly recommend this for a night out with friends, or a cool date night. It seemed as though reservations would be a good idea, although we didnt have them and were okay (it was busy, though)."
5,"Yeah it was good. My wife & I went with 2 other foodie couples, who are good friends, for our monthly ""side dish"" function.  The food was all fantastic.  All 5 of the other people in our group were drinking martinis, which they all said were very tasty as well, but at $12-$16 per, Im a little put off.  Im more of a beer guy anyway, so I had a couple of craft-brews that are not available everywhere, and then settled on a Firestone DBA -- a very very tasty beer -- and had several of those.  Great food, great booze, club music atmosphere is pretty cool. Outdoor area is excellent. Felt like an idiot when I had to ask where the mens room was only to turn around and find that the huge wall of a door was right behind me and said ""he"" in huge letters on the bottom of the door.  Oh and then (6 or 7 strong beers into the evening) I found that the mirror next to the (only) urinal in the mens room misled me into believing there was a second urinal, which I tried unsuccessfully to walk to.  Why is that guy walking directly toward me?  Oh, its me.  In the mirror. Dumbass.  So then (after relieving myself in the actual urinal) I go back out to the table to tell the story about trying to use the urinal in the mens room that doenst exist, and somebody else says ""yeah the same fucking thing happened to me too!"" so I dont feel like such a dumbass anymore.  Fun night."
3,"I was craving something last night and couldnt figure out what I wanted. I happened to stumble across this place and decided to give it a try. I ordered the house fried rice and some crab rangoon. Now the crab rangoon were pretty good and I was actually bummed that you only got four but it was only about $2.50 so I cannot complain too much. The fried rice was just ok. For it to be house friend rice, which comes with beef, chicken, pork and shrimp, I can understand not having alot of the shrimp but it didnt have much of anything. I mean it tasted ok, but I was hoping for a little bit more meat than there was. It was a quick meal considering I didnt really know what I wanted to eat anyway. I may give it another try and hope that its a little better next time."
5,"I couldnt wait to get home and yelp this place. Five stars, too!  After a (raw chicken) bad experience some 13 years ago, I hadnt been to Bandera until tonight. WOW! It was a GREAT experience!!!  We started off with a grilled artichoke which was fabulous!  Both of us had the Texas Hill Country Ribs which came with cole slaw (not your ordinary cole slaw) and the most delish matchstick fries.  Unfortunately, I dont eat seeds and nuts (peanuts in the cole slaw...my husband loved it) but the very polite and wonderful server, Sarah, offered some other sides and I picked the braised red cabbage, which came with a little goat cheese on the top which was to die-for delish!! Home made wonderful braised red cabbage!  The entire meal was SUPERB! The service was phenomenal, and we were lucky enough to sit by the kitchen and see all of the dishes come out...they all looked YUMMY!  I am so happy that my neighbor suggested Banderas ribs, and will go back frequently as you can tell this place is run as a tight ship. Everyone is polished, polite and efficient! The food is an experience in perfection, and the service tip top! Next time, Ill take some pictures (if Im not too hungry)...  I dont think its a shorts and jeans type of place but a dressy/casual type of place, if you know what I mean... REALLY EXCELLENT FOOD!"
5,"Holy frijoles- this place lived up to the hype. Im surprised how how good the pizza is here in Arizona. Very tasty, and definitely some of the best pizza Ive had in the valley. The only downside is that there is usually a long wait to be seated, and then once your seated, it takes a longer wait for your pizza. The prices are average, the service was so-so, but the food was excellent! Nice location too, right in Old Town so you can have a drink at a nearby bar while you wait for your table. Cool place for date-night, or to have dinner with family. Its fairly casual, but charming at the same time."
4,Very nice views of Phoenix.  Not a very challenging hike but very enjoyable. Gets steep at the very top but a couple of hard steps will get you to a nice view
3,"The people who are either stocking the shelves, cleaning the floors, or behind the counter have all been polite so far. I have nothing really bad to say, but nothing really great either. Keep perservering...maybe Ill write another review when something outrageous happens :)"
5,"Woohoo is right. My hubby and I have gone a few times for happy hour and always enjoyed ourselves. Last night was the best so far. We were enjoying a few Left Hands and ordered the Tuesday night pizza special. It was 2 for 1 basically so we each ordered our fave. Apparently the GM thought my pizza was too done so he brought out the "" burnt"" one and already had another one cooking. I actually like my pizza that way but hey, I could understand where he was coming from. The second pizza was beautiful, a work of art. My husbands pie was great, all he kept saying was how great the crust was. I wil definitely bring all my friends and clients here. Special service too!  thanks again to Dan the general manager and our delicious server Reina ( sorry there isnt a better word,is there?)            Linda and Ron"
2,"My bf and I drove in from ""the city"" lol and met some friends here for brunch.  We didnt have to wait long to get seated which was great.  The waitress came and took our drink order and right away she didnt seem too thrilled.  So I ordered an omelet and asked for turkey sausage instead of the toast or pancakes it came with, she looked at me like I was asking for a cure to cancer and proceeded to tell me that I would have to be charged full-price.  Well duh, I kinda figured and since I asked it was probably ok.  Needless to say, we waited 30 mins to get our food, which we had to ask her for.  My omelet was cold, I didnt get the turkey sausage I had ordered but she did add it to the check.  Thank god we had a groupon or else it would have been a total loss.  The Breakfast Club in Old Town is better!"
4,absolutely love this place. It is a fru-fru hang out joint that isnt pretentious.  The cucumber lemonade has become my favorite non-alcoholic drink and their bruschetta is always the best!
5,"I live in LA where these shops are on every corner.  I can say without a doubt, this is the best FroYo Ive had! On top of that, the store staff is super-friendly and the place is immaculately clean.  They are also serving gelato, pastries and fresh coffee/espresso.  Check it out!"
1,Not a company to do business with ... From my experience !
3,"The food is good, but I think the prices are too high for what you get.  Considering there are plenty of other places to go for good subs, salads and fruit platters that would be much cheaper, its hard to choose Duck and Decanter over them. However, I will go here when I dont have to pay.  Why not, right?"
3,"So I went here twice and I hated it the first time.  I dont know if I got a bad cut of meat or what, but my burrito was a bit too fatty.  I think it was the red chile burrito, or something. Having said that, I recently gave it another shot and and went for the carne asada burrito.  Very, very good.  The cut of the beef is a little thicker than the usual Salazars or Filibertos burrito, but it was really good regardless.  Oh, and the beans in there were awesome, too.  It didnt have guacamole and I didnt notice till it was too late, but Ill be sure to get some in there next time. Overall, I give it 3 stars because i really hated my first visit, but their carne asada is completely legit."
4,"I continue to give Golden Egg Roll 4 stars.  I love the house chicken and schezwan chicken (Im sure I misspelled that).  I did not like the Hunan chicken; however, I despise bell peppers and didnt realize they were in this meal until after I got it.  Golden Egg Roll became a regular place for me to go to because it was cheap and better than decent.  Now that Ive moved, Im going to miss this place."
3,"This is a great place to have a casual meal.  Its obviously a pub atmosphere but its large enough to accommodate a lot of people without it getting crowded.  They also have many well placed flat screen tvs. (I just wish they would turn on the closed captioning!  Its one thing if youre watching a sporting event but when they have on an analysis show I want to hear the analysis!)   My husband had the beer sampler and enjoyed most of the varieties, the Raj IPA was his favorite (the 8th Street Ale and Kiltlifter are the more popular ones).  We had the soft pretzel appetizer which was ok, but Im spoiled when it comes to pretzels having lived in Philly and lived on them for my entire college career.   I wish it came with a honey mustard to dip in and not just regular spicy mustard.  I had the French Dip which was solid - not the best Ive had but still pretty good.  My husband had the Tap Room Tenderloin sandwich that he enjoyed - the onion straws and bleu cheese were a nice touch. Now this is just stupid.  (Saturday, 4/13)   Ring ring ring. . . ""Hello, Four Peaks"" ""Hi, will you be showing the Red Sox/Yankees game?"" ""Yes, definitely."" ""Even though its being blacked out?"" ""Blacked out?"" ""Yeah, Fox wont be showing the game because the Diamondbacks game is on at the same time.  Youre getting an east coast feed?  From NY or Boston?"" ""Feed?"" ""Yeah, you know, youre getting the broadcast from the Fox affiliate in NY or Boston?"" "". . .Um. . .well definitely be showing the game. . ."" ""Ok. . .""   Drive to Four Peaks ""Hello! Welcome to Four Peaks!  Table for 2?"" ""Yeah, somewhere we can see the Sox/Yankees game."" ""Oh sorry, its being blacked out"" ""What?!  But I called 15 minutes ago and you said you were showing it!"" ""No sorry, that Diamondbacks game is on at the same time so were not getting the Sox/Yankees game"" ""THATS WHAT I SAID ON THE PHONE AND YOU SAID YOU WERE SHOWING IT!"" ""Oh, well do you know who you talked to?"" ""It wasnt you?!  I dont know!  Some moron who said youd be showing the game!""   Youre not getting my business if you blatantly lie to me just to get me in the door."
5,"My fiancé took his pediatric boards yesterday and that calls for a no-more-studying-at-coffee-shops-during-dinner celebration! We are brand new to Phoenix and these last few months have been eating lots of Mexican and some more Mexican, which we are not complaining about in the least, but it was time for something different. Our neighbor recommended Richardsons/Rokerij as his favorite so I made a reservation for Monday night. We sat in their downstairs dining room tucked in a generous booth in the back corner. My fiancé ordered a Dark and Stormy and we split a bottle of Pinot Noir as our server informed us of their 1/2 price bottles of wine deal. Hurrah! We ordered 2 appetizers: the bacon-wrapped scallops and the crab-stuffed mushrooms. One bite of the scallops and we were in heaven. They were GIANT, perfectly cooked, and beautifully placed in a pool of amazingly different dipping sauces. You can never go wrong with wrapping bacon on a piece of, well, anything, but this appetizer was magical. My fiancé ordered the Rokerij Steak with roasted corn and mashed sweet potatoes in a chili pepper. Im not a steak lover, but took one bite of his dish and it melted in my mouth. Fantastic. I ordered the Swordfish special with roasted eggplant and mashed sweet potatoes in the chili pepper as well, and I devoured every bite!  What did it for me, however, was the dessert. We shared the truffle with vanilla gelato topped with berries. The truffles were like buttery brownies in a hard shell and perfectly portioned to satisfy. Very memorable. We will be back, even if its just for the truffles!"
4,"A short an sweet report about lunch.... This was a quick lunch with my best friend Melissa and was well worth it!!   We were greeted by the counter person with a warm welcome and when I advised I had never been here before, she took me through a quick tour of the menu and suggested what to order.  Following her suggestions was a great choice!   We both had the same thing, The Hawaiian BBQ Mix.  This comes with BBQ Chicken, BBQ Beef and Kalbi Short Ribs.  I also added Teriyaki sauce to the Chicken.  The meals came with 2 scoops of rice, a single scoop of macaroni salad and veg.   The flavors were wonderful, the beat tender and juicy.  The ribs were a thin slide and you had to navigate around the bones but it was delicious! For months I have been threatening to stop by but never have,  Now I am sad for all I have missed!!  Definitely going back!!   Overall:  This place is a keeper!  Good service, great food, served fairly quickly....We are already making plans for your next visit!  Enjoy!"
4,Best basic $12 in/exterior wash i got in a while. Didnt even have to tell them to wipe down anything.
2,"What more can I say except it is over priced, greasy Mexican food! I have had better in Texas, the only thing that saved them from being a one star is their great salsa!"
1,"I will never make another purchase from this company ever again! The company tried to deliver damaged furniture to my home and then gave me the run around about processing a refund when I refused to accept the items. After 5 phone conversations, they agreed to refund me for refusing damaged items. I cannot recommend this to anyone."
1,"I usually do not write reviews, but was so horrified by my experience I had to. Went for a late night bite and drink with a friend, they were fairly busy so we had a seat at the bar. As I frequent The Moon often, I was happy to see the bar was busy as well. The bartender quickly came over and was noticably intoxicated, as she could not even tell me the flavors of vodka they had. We ordered our drinks, and watched as she broke glass into the ice, knocked over glassware and broke a beer bottle. As we looked around most of the guests had the same look of horror on their face. We decided to order some food, as she spilled my drink on us (refilled it with something completely different) and she could barely even talk at this point. We saw management watch her behavior and do nothing, as she preceded to grab dirty glassware and refill it with beer. I was so appauled by this we left befpre finishing our drinks or food. Im not sure what she was on but if its visible to paying customers it should be visible to management. Being beyond embarassed for the establishment, I would doubt I will come back, sad as we would frequent the Moon 2-3 times a week. Horrible."
4,"A definite four stars, the focus on fresh food and a great breakfast has build a strong following at this destination location in Scottsdale Civic Center. now that i think about it how can i not give this place a 5 stars theirs way to much creativity and freshnewssness in the fruit, veg and the nectar of the gods, Coffee, all packed into one nice bright orange place.   Old Town has a few breakfast spots but this is one you have to find.  can i say I hope to see this as a Scottsdale yelp ""hidden gem."" As for my last meal I had the prosciutto melt and it went past expectations, the fresh basil really added the extra taste.   Service was ok, a typical cafe style, the restaurant does not seek to be over pertinacious, the look is clean and the cafe is a really nice touch with options to order and go.    So many Little restaurants like this keeps me looking for the next one.  Dont forget for later in the night AZ 88 is just down a few steps.   Happy breakfast, Kevin PS there seems to be some kind of yelp trend, does a hand full of yelps make a difference in a restaurant, does that have a yelp definition when this happens."
4,"Totally fantastic.  I love to stop by here whenever I am in Phoenix for their pork sandwich -- which is great. I especially like the barbecue sauce that they use.  I hear on good authority that many other menu items are good, but I cant tear myself away from the the pulled pork sandwich. They also do a really tasty potato salad, sweet potato pie, and cobbler."
4,"Midday parking at this place is seriously a joke, but such is the case with a lot of swank midtown lunch spots.  Pizza was great, my East Coast hailing girlfriend gave it a thumbs up, which for an AZ pizza place is a huge kudos. We came to check out both this and the adjoining Pink Spot Coffee and Ice cream. We ate on the ice cream side, so I cant comment much on the decor of the Z Pizza side.  Good ingredients, not the usual suspects, so that is a change. I will pay for good quality pizza, so the price was in line for the quality of the food. It did a ton of lunch business but was efficient and the staff was smiling and not hating their life, which is always pleasant ."
5,I really like this place... they have great wine... try the tasting... it is 10 bucks and you get 5 tastes... they make almost all of the wine in house (i know the almond champagne is not made there)... i have not found any wine that i dont like... my favorite is their porto and chocolate port. the other thing you can do is have a bottling party.  i recently purchased 30 bottles (at a great price!!!  cheaper then the wine stores).  they make the batch for you and then you have a party to bottle and label it.  this is a great and fun different party for you are your friends.   despite it location it is a great place for a date...
4,"Really great finds. Helped me stock a vintage 60s bar.  Ron is very helpful and knows where everything is in the store.  Great at finding knick nacks such as distressed wood, door knobs, irons, kitchen wares, etc.  Something for everyone."
5,"ive never had a problem getting assistance here, except when its busy, usually on a sat/sun. its not that far from the house, maybe a mile, so i if im in a real bind, i come on by here to pick up some stuff.  theyve offered groupons here and with those, ive bought some power tools and hardware. ace brand is cheaper price but the quality seems to be just as good!"
1,This location is now closed.
2,"Being the only gay bar in Scottsdale aside from BS West, Ive found myself at Forbidden a few times.  Forbidden is an ambitious concept--a gay club with two rooms and two deejays in a city not known for its gay nightlife. Sadly Forbidden does not deliver.   The club is usually pretty busy on a Saturday night, but the crowd leaves a bit to be desired.  The patrons are mostly unattractive, kind of trashy in fact, and not very friendly.   I believe deejay in the main room does not change on the weekends, where he spins top 40 dance/pop to a drunk college-aged crowd.  In the OZ room (the smaller room) they have different local deejays, who, from what Ive seen, spin a variety of different types of music--sometimes its circuity music, sometimes its eighties music, it all depends on the deejay for that night.  The OZ room has been pretty empty the few times Ive been there.  The sound system in both rooms leaves quite a bit to be desired from a place that calls itself a club.   The drinks are reasonably priced for a bar in Scottsdale.   The décor is okay, but not very interesting.  Forbidden isnt terrible.  It is, however, just plain boring (bad music on a bad sound system, uninteresting décor, and an unimpressive and unfriendly crowd)!"
3,Ok.  Not great for what is supposedly a good steak joint.  Not much ambiance and food was good not great.
2,"When I was younger and first moved to Arizona, Serranos on Rural Road became a family tradition to get mexican food. It was basically all I knew till adulthood. If I would have reviewed this place 10 years ago, it would have been 5 stars but now the blinders are off and I have money to try better places. One by one they all seem to dwarf Serranos in most every way. I feel kinda guilty writing this and hope my family does not read this :) But it has to be said. I would still eat at Serranos but it doesnt have the same feeling anymore. The Chimichangas are good and their bean dip is awesome. Nothing I have had is gross or anything but its just   basic greasy mexican food. There are better places out there. Once again to any family reading this....Im sorry :)"
3,"Threw a friends baby shower here and it went pretty smoothly. We made reservations well in advance, and it was a small party. Im not a huge fan of their food but its always busy so clearly other people dont have my same opinion. The three stars is for the service, they were super attentive and everything was taken care of for our party. I just dont think the cheesecake is that great, Im sorry! But the apps arent too bad."
2,"If Im rating strictly on getting what I wanted out of the visit, this doctor is fine.  He checked my eyes, did all of the tests and I walked out with my prescription. Here is why I cant give him a good review (and this is solely based on my personality and preferences while dealing with the service industry- others may think hes wonderful...) 1)  I purposely chose an early morning (7:30 a.m.) appointment so that I would get to work by 9.  My office is less than a mile from his office and I was still running into work at 9:05 a.m.  This is due to the very long-winded soap-box like speech that Dr. Greene gave me.  I am a get-in, get-out type of person who hates small talk and hates self-promotion even more and if I heard him tell me how often he visits the gym or works out one more time, I probably would have gauged my eyes out right there to never need an optometrist again.  I also learned all about his wife, friends boat...you name it...he told me about it (completely unsolicited). 2)  I am an educated individual who does not need an hour-long explanation- filled with graphical references and cutesy anecdotes- about why I now need progressive lenses. 3)  The fear-inducing sales pitch by the staff and the doctor was a bit much.  I realize that all optometrists and dentists are going this route now- ""buy this test (not covered by insurance) and be free from worry that youll instantly go blind""; however, if I want something, Ill ask for it...just like any other retailer.   Like I said...I got what I needed, a solid eye exam and prescription.  However, I purposely did not buy glasses there due to the doctors cheesy personality and the ""hard-sell"" environment.  Again, there are obviously (based on the other posters) people who are attracted to this type of personality...I am not one of them.   Hence, why I do most of my shopping online."
4,"One of my favorite restaurants in the valley. I usually go for the turkey wrap or one of their pizzas. On this day we went for happy hour, which is daily after 9pm and tried several tapas and a 4 peaks beer. Everything was really good."
4,"I was a little hesitant of Zipps when we pulled in - didnt look from the outside like it would offer an awesome time.  Walking in around 7 on a Friday night revealed a place that was almost full.  We chose to sit on the chilly patio, which did have a couple of heaters.  The heaters were a little high up and less effective, but it was also one of the coldest nights this year.  Service was fast and friendly, we never ran out of beer.  I got the BLT on Sourdough, and so did my friend, her husband got the Black and Blue Burger.  The fries were good, but not as crispy as I like.  The flavor was great and I ended up eating all of them.  The BLT was awesome! Tons of crispy bacon, and they cut it so that you were able to eat the sandwich without bacon attacking you.  The sourdough bread was thick cut and lightly toasted. The burger was a little less than we expected - 2 nice size patties, but the blue cheese could have been done a little better, and it was very messy.  The onion rings were nice sized and with great, fluffy breading on them. The on tap beer list was a little heavy on the cheap domestics for my taste, but they did have an Alaskan Amber that went great with the food. We were able to sit and talk for several hours, and the server made sure that we always had what we needed."
5,I had a great dinner there.  One of my best in a long time.  It was sucha treat.  Once in a while you have to take care of yourself and just enjoy what life has to offer.   Chef Juan was great to talk to.  Seems this guy has been there sinsr they broke ground.   If you truely like yourself take a walk around the grounds after dinner and smoke a cigar at the big Fire Pit or over by the dock. Life is good.
4,"Surprisingly authentic Sichuan cuisine in Phoenix. The staff were very friendly and accommodated our infant without any problem. The mapo doufu had great spice to it. The garlic eggplant (yuxiang qiezi) had excellent flavor and we also highly recommend the twice cooked pork (hui guo rou) and fried green beans (ganbian sijidou). The prices are certainly reasonable for the size and quality of the food. The open kitchen is also a nice touch as it gives kids something fun to stare at (flames shoot up from the dishes being cooked every few minutes). Admittedly, we only went because out POS airline put us up at the residence inn across the street after we missed a connecting flight, however, if we go back to Phoenix or if we lived in Phoenix, wed definitely go to Szechwan Palace again."
3,"When we lived in AZ, my biggest regret was not coming here. Ive always wanted to try it. Doing our road tripping this week, I was able to.  Parking was easy for a weekday...we went in - through the wrong door. Oops. The server who was stocking things seemed surprised, but rolled with it. She said we could sit anywhere we wanted (we were a party of three). We chose a table for 6 so we could spread out a little and not be so squished. She immediately snapped, ""Not that - its for 6 people."" I almost said, ""Then dont tell us we can sit wherever we want..."" I refrained. That surly girl nearly spoiled it, but luckily our server saved the day. I saw the hot dog...you know, the 22 inch insane monster on the menu. I split it with my friend. We didnt even finish it. It was delicious, if a bit salty. I knew it was a salt overload because in under an hour my fingers were swollen. :( Oh salt, why must I love you yet be so affected by you? We didnt finish it, but definitely enjoyed it. If I get this again when in town, Ill get it plain and still split it with a friend."
4,"Bianco is a great place to go for a reasonably priced dinner with good ambiance and solid rendition of Mexican food.   Yup, there are holes-in-the-wall tacquerias with tastier food.  But Bianco is spot-on in terms of  overall concept with good service and modern furnishing. Puts this on a repeat list."
1,"Love the idea - vegan Mexican. Have tried to eat there twice. Both times checked their FB page for hours, both times they were closed. Called their phone number, no one answered. No sign, no explanation on FB. Pathetic."
5,"Introduced to Dlish today by a friend. Id already had breakfast (although the menu looks great, lots of delicious sounding, healthy options) but he suggested a Chai coffee. I dont usually like Chai Tea, but I thought Id give the Chai coffee a chance based on his recommendation. When I ordered, the server suggested a ""Sexy Dirty Chai"", which as lurid as it sounds means adding vanilla. The Sexy Dirty Chai Coffee over ice is hands down now my favorite coffee drink. The place is tiny, has a really cool, funky interior and also has a drive thru- a true local gem. The service is friendly and energetic and I plan to start my day here again soon :)"
2,"We just stopped here as Slices no longer exits at TMP :( For JUST cold meat sandwiches...they are over priced. Short variety and more than $3 for some salame, cheese in average white bread.....no thank you."
3,"I really wasnt impressed. Came here with some friends to grab some takeout, and nothing really made me smile. The al pastor was meh, at best. The carne asada wasnt particularly noteworthy, and though the vampiro was tasty, there wasnt anything hugely redeeming about it. Nothing to write home about. Sucks, because my friends in Arizona swear by this place. Im giving it three stars more out of courtesy to them, but my own personal experience here wasnt anything over two. The people who worked here were very friendly...  Ive heard that the ceviche is the bomb diggity... I wish I could come back here and give it a better review, because Im sure that next time would be better, but as it stands right now, Im just not a huge fan. Sorry guys!"
3,"Everything was nice. The ice cream was delicious, no overwhelming alcohol taste & an interesting variety of flavors. Service was fine, place was clean. Ill go back, but only because I have a killer sweet tooth and theyre in the neighborhood."
4,"Food? Awesome. Service? Sufficient. Layout? Not the best. We stopped into Chompies this past Friday morning on our way out of town for the long weekend. My husband and I have this obsession with breakfast bagels - in particular, breakfast bagels from one amazing joint that makes the absolute best breakfast bagel EVER in our colleges hometown. We are always searching for a place as good as Bodos...well, even 3/4 as good as Bodos would do...and we never find it. Bodos is about the most efficient bagel store on Earth (literally the line of 40-50 people is serviced in 10 minutes) and cheap, too! So, we decided to give Chompies a whirl. I dont love the location - like everything else in Arizona, it is tucked into a strip mall. However, there was enough parking and we found it just fine. When you walk in, youre a bit confused as to where to go. Then you realize if you want to eat a full service sit down meal, head to the left - we didnt want to do this, but the food that I was eyeing from afar looked good. To the right is their bakery, which has some pretty appetizing cakes, cookies and desserts. Then there is this counter where you deduce that you order ""to go"" meals. We were overwhelmed by the menu but managed to pull ourselves together in time to order. We both had that initial panic attack of ""oh crap, I have never been here and the menu is longer than a 5 year olds Christmas list and I dont even know where to start because suddenly I feel like I cant even read English."" Deep breath. Its not actually that overwhelming, just a tad unorganized. After ordering, we were instructed to walk all the way across the bakery to a random counter to pay. It was so random the way they had it set up, but we did as we were told and then we waited. My husbands sandwich took a while to make....again, I dont know how Bodos does it, but Chompies is probably 4 times slower. Or is it more appropriate to say that Bodos is 4 times as fast? Whatever. Either way, Bodos has the breakfast bagel process down perfectly. Waiting was fine, though...we werent in a rush. When my husbands warm sandwich was finally ready, we got our stuff and then headed outside (there is nowhere to eat inside if you dont want to have a full service meal, which is one complaint I would make about this place). Who wants to eat their bagel outside when its pushing 110 degrees? Not me. Even if I am under a strip mall canopy that provides some shade. Anyway, his sandwich was actually really tasty - warm and fresh and really yummy. My bagel was not toasted, which I had requested, which was slightly annoying. However, the bagel itself was very good. We will definitely be back for the food, and I totally recommend this place for grabbing some freshly baked bagels or desserts or whatever. They do have a deli counter as well (meats, cheese, etc). Our breakfast was less than $8 without drinks - fair enough. I just wish that the layout were a little better and that it was more efficient. I also wish I could have eaten inside. Next time we will likely just do the full service thing. In the end, it seems that nothing will ever compare to our beloved Bodos in Charlottesville, Virginia."
5,"Simply the best Ethiopian Ive ever had.  Grew up in VA with DC as my stompin grounds (home of a large Ethiopian population) and even had a good amount of Ethiopian home-cooked meals by friends and none was as good as this place.   I go to AZ once a year for work and each time I am sure to stop in.  I usually get the veggie or meat-lovers meals since they tend to be such a good bargain, but have also ordered separate items as well.   The vibe is casual and the service is excellent.  The staff have always been very friendly --- another reason I keep going back."
3,"I always feel a sense of guilt having to write a less than stellar review after meeting the owner of a restaurant.  Lucia was Beautiful and sweet, and a pleasure to meet, my lunch, however, was not fit to eat.  I ordered the THE HUMM-DINGER VEGAN WRAP: Roasted artichoke, zucchini, red bell pepper, onion, fresh spinach and hummus with a balsamic reduction drizzle, with a side of fruit and the sun dried tomato wrap.  Notice it says ""Roasted"", the cashier told me the Veggies were ""Grilled"". Unfortunately, to my dismay, they were neither.  Everything inside was heated up, by either stove or microwave, Id guess the latter, and the ""Sun Dried Tomato Wrap"" was thin, doughy and utterly flavorless, not to mention a shocking pink color, which Im sure was due to being naturally colored with beet juice, but did not help make things anymore appetizing. The fruit was a soggy pile of your typical pre-cut cantaloupe, honey dew mix.  It was not what I was expecting AT ALL, when I think of a grilled veggie wrap, I imagine tasting all those veggies bursting with flavor after caramelizing on the grill, they had no flavor though. I also did not expect the temperature to be Hot, chilled would have been better in my opinion if the veggies had actually bee grilled that is.  This lunch to me was less than average and as I sat there will my full plate in front of me I was asked how my meal was, I clearly stated my concerns as I have here and was simply told that it was a ""Best Seller"".  Lucia did send over a piece of chocolate cake, which was appreciated, but unfortunately missed the mark since Im Vegan and the desserts arent.  Honestly, in my opinion, aside from the market, most of the menu items are anything but healthy.  The 3 stars is for the market, my food would have been 1. And that folks is why I am the Lunch Snob!"
4,"Ive been a Chars patron since before we were legal to be in there (many years ago, previous owners). It has always been a lively place with a diverse crowd of aging black hep-cats, college students, bikers, tweakers, college students, heavy middle aged white women who love black men, the ocassional tranny and Hispanic couples on dates with a sprinkling of occasional stippers/hookers. In other words - everything you would want to make a blues bar entertaining and just seedy enough to be interesting.  They are one of the only places in Central Phoenix with live music almost every night of the week and the cover, if any, is typically only a couple of bucks. The place is small and dark and crowded, like a blues bar in an old converted house should be. Talent varies by night but anytime you go its passable. Personal favorites are lady J and Bam Bam and any combination thereof, which is what you usually get any way. Wander in on a random Monday night and 11:30 and you will find music, cruising, and drinks waiting. There is a small enclosed patio up front for smoking, about 16 spaces in their lot and street parking available on the residential street, but watch the signs and dont block driveways. You can also cross 7th Ave, but be careful dodging cars. The neighborhood looks scarier than it is so dont be alarmed by a transient or two wandering down the street but they dont bite unless you pay extra. Close to lite rail as well in case sneaker pimps want to try to cross over from Central, but hopefully they wont."
3,"Bacon madness! Huge french toast! Cute little piggies decorating the orange walls! Oink is a friendly, peppy place to go for breakfast. The food is pretty good, the place is happy, all-in-all I would say this is the perfect place to wake up in the morning! The only irksome quality was our server, who seemed very nervous, checked on us at weird times, and said ""youre welcome"" too often (I didnt know that was possible, but it was).  I enjoyed the jalapeno (!) bacon and the oink french toast. The cinnamon rolls were also tasty, but my group was disappointed by the eggs benedict. I would say the food could be better, but its just awesome to have a local breakfast place somewhere in my neighborhood now!"
2,"US Airways used to be right up there w/Continental.. now theyre down there I didnt even mind the fact that they started charging for their food..  But now theyre going overboard..  I didnt want to bring a heavy jacket w/me to Cabo, so I wore a light jacket and I figured the standard blanket they give you during the flight would suffice.  I noticed there werent any blankets on board and when I asked a flight attendant for one he said "".......yea.. for $7"" I almost started laughing cause I thought he was trying to crack a joke.   He wasnt.   Introducing US Airways ""nap pack"" comes w/crappy blanket, ear plugs, inflatable neck rest , for only $7!  Use the money you were previously going to use to purchase your online crappy meal for your standard necessities!   So I decline.. and they must crank the A/C up ridiculously to tempt you to purchase their stupid nappy pack.. cause the tip of my nose was cold and I just couldnt sleep at all during my flight w hile I was trying cover every surface of my body w/my stretched out light jacket. And you also suck cause you run out of your purchased meals...who doesnt pack enough for the flight?  You suck at even saving money for yourselves.."
4,"I am a shoe addict.  I also appreciate a good bargain.  Whenever I am bored and have a little time on my hands, I like to take a walk through DSW.  I think it is kind of like playing ""dress up"".  You can try on anything and everything.  Such fun!  This location is one of the better ones I have visited.  It is well-organized, and the stock turns over regularly.  It is one of those hit or miss places - I will either leave with nothing or with an obnoxious amount of new footwear.  You just never know.  It has a fairly large clearance section as well - if you have the patience to look, bargains can often be found.  Definitely sign up for their rewards program - you will receive coupons regularly - yay!  Happy hunting!"
5,I had Thai coffee and thai fresh rolls. It was good. The vegetables were fresh and delicious. Plans to visit again.
4,"Inexpensive, tasty, fast. The gentle peanut dressing on the pre-meal salad gets you started on a simple, no-frills meal with exactly one option from all of the classic dishes you expect at a Thai restaurant in America: massaman, red, green, yellow, or panang curry; pad thai or chowmein; meat or vegetable rice plates. Theres nothing extravagant in spices or food choices, but you can order the spiciness level to you liking."
3,"Wanted some mexican that wasnt taco bell. The hotel recommend this place. The restaurant smelled like the inside of a tomato sauce can. I was turned off almost immediately. I decided to sit on the patio and try it out anyway. I ordered the Chipotle BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad with a light cilantro lime dressing. It was okay. The chips and salsa were okay too, nothing to brag about. The salsa tasted like it came from a can. Im happy I ordered a salad. The redeeming factors were the Arizona Sunset Margarita and the good service. I think once restaurants turn into chains, they seem to lose their original character."
5,"4.5 stars! Ive eaten at Liberty Market a few times already, but this morning marked my first breakfast- and what a fantastic meal it was!- of pancakes (3 in a stack; $6.5) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=Xg8U6Fz2E8hu0xQ3Hf7CZg#Xg8U6Fz2E8hu0xQ3Hf7CZg w/ added topping of ""market-made granola"" ($1), a side of Grilled Flattened Meatballs ($3.5) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=MMwKpMltbKCWNNlraI-tGw#MMwKpMltbKCWNNlraI-tGw, and a double-shot of espresso ($2) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=M1WrCuX3oouHHrynL8KJQg#M1WrCuX3oouHHrynL8KJQg.  Service was in fine form-- I couldnt have the market-made maple syrup blend, nor any of the house-whipped cream, blueberry compote, raspberry and apricot jams, or any of the flavored syrups used at the coffee counter (my server patiently checked for those items we were unsure about), and when I asked for chocolate chips, I was, instead, offered a chocolate syrup made from scratch composed of chocolate, sugar, and coco oil... good stuff!  This syrup would be excellent on ice cream sundaes, too.  (FYI, I didnt really need anything extra to add to the pancakes and meatballs... the two paired well!) Ive mentioned this once before, but I think its such a great thing to yelp about again-- buy an espresso (or any of their specialty coffees), and you can have unlimited cups of regular coffee during your meal!  Not like I needed more caffeine after the double-shot, but I did have some of the house-blend coffee.  After 1.5 pancakes, the meatballs (watch out, theyre very greasy!), and caffeine, Ill be good to go for a few hours, despite only having four hours of sleep!  (Im hoping, anyway!) p.s.  Despite tipping more than 20% at the cashier upon ordering, I thought Bruce, the server who took care of me at my table, deserved a couple more bananas for not displaying annoyance at my staying here so long.  One more reason why I love Liberty Market so much!   Addendum:  After getting directions from Bruce as to the quickest way to 101 N, he asked me if I wanted a cup of coffee to go, gratis!  Have I told you how much I love Liberty Market?? Helpful hint:  Free wifi can be accessed by entering the code printed at the bottom of your receipt."
1,We ordered.  I had to return my chicken tenders.  Undr cooked and rubbery.  My wife ordered a hamburger and is now home throwing it up.  what a horrible experience.  We have been huge fans and now this?  I called and spoke with someone who barely has a grasp on our language and they said they would get right back to me.  Still waiting My wife is in bed looking so sick.  We will never return!!
4,My dog is very difficult and they do a very good job handling her.  It did take a few times before she got comfortable with them.  I am glad I found The Doggie Door.
4,Met my friend Jackie to grab a cup of coffee and ended up staying for hours!  It is a great place to relax with comfy seats and a great vibe.  We plan to go there one night after a movie to sit and relax while listening to the live music.  Very cool.  They have delicious sandwiches and their baked goods looked amazing!   The baristas are so nice and helpful and very friendly.  The place is modern and inviting. They offer so many organic healthy choices.  It is located in Norterra close to the Harkins Theater. Glad she suggested this place ~ we will definitely be back.
5,"My home airport and one of the nicest terminals in the USA! Great food, cool things to see and do, you just cant get bored here!"
4,"Theres different kinds of Mexican places around.   Type A:  Pseudo-Mexican fast food (Taco Bell, El Pollo Loco, Del Taco, etc.) Type B: REAL Mexican fast food (whateveri-bertos, Baja Fresh, Rubios etc.) Type C: Various traditional taquerias (Los Favoritos, Rivas Mexican Food, etc.) Type D: ""Mexican Dennys"" or chain-type sit down Mexican Restaurants--traditional-style or not (Chevys, El Torito, Macayos, etc.)  Type E: REAL formal or semi-formal Mexican restaurants (I dont know any in the Valley yet, but in the Bay Area there is the now closed La Michoacana in San Mateo, CA, etc.) Valle Luna is a Type D, and a pretty good one as well.  Delicious traditional-style Mexican food.  The interior looks like what you usually see in a Chevys or Macayos.  Its visually pleasing, and service is friendly and helpful.  They have all the beers, margaritas, and tequila that you usually find at places like this (you know what I mean).  Its the kind of Mexican place you take someone for their birthday--exactly. Do you check in to places on Yelp using your iPhone?   Come to Valle Luna!  Show them the check-in on your phone and you get $5 off of a meal costing $20 or more.  Perfect for lunch with your co-worker. Valle Luna means good Mexifood.  If youre in the mood for a Type D, bypass the ""Fresh Mex"" and come here."
4,"I have gone here several times and have tried the pizza, subs and the calzones.  I have not had anything there that I did not like and the only reason I dont give this five stars is because everytime I am in there it seems a large group with lots of young kids has just sat down (or come to run around me while I try to eat) at the same time as my date and I.  I admit, I wish restaurants had sections for families so that those who do not like watching kids run around or spitting food out of their mouths on to the table could eat in peace, but that is just me and that is why I have dogs and not children. Anyway, this place has awesome food, good service and if you can handle large groups of families then I highly recommend you take the drive out here to give it a try."
1,"Nice looking place with average food and horrible service.  Everything took forever and no one came by to see how we were doing.  We literally watched our server going around setting tables and taking napkins off of empty tables rather than making himself available to us.  He wandered around from table to table in a completely unoccupied area of the restaurant the majority of the time we were there.  The food was luke-warm and nothing special.  I was only here once so I hate to be so down on the place, but based on the other reviews my experience sounds pretty typical.  Dont waste your money."
4,"Copper Star is a great example of adaptive use in the heart of the Melrose curve. Who would have thought that a building initially designed to provide fuel to cars would so work so well serving fuel to humans? Their coffee is locally roasted and, while not my favorite, is well above average in Phoenix. Their drive-thru is a great feature for those mornings when Im running late. For the coffee adverse, Copper Star serves chai, tea, smoothies, Italian sodas, and some unique drinks including a black cherry limeade. Foodwise, there is a wide selection of baked goods,including some of the best bagels. They also have decent lunch offerings, such as sandwiches and a tasty hummus platter. But where they shine is their home baked cupcakes. (Ive seen Mayor Gordon here on several occasions getting his cupcake fix!)  Despite being in a converted gas station/garage, the atmosphere is quite a bit more cozy than most of the other coffee shops in central Phoenix. While the sandblasted block walls and exposed ceiling let that buildings industrial past peak through, this is offset by rotating art work and selection of comfortable (if a bit dingy) couches and easy chairs as well as small bistro tables and long work tables to choose from. The staff is friendly and helpful, and the owner, Bill, is a great neighborhood resource. He can tell you anything and everything going on along 7th Ave. All in all a good place to grab a coffee and cupcake,  meet a friend or get some old fashioned reading done. I cant recommend it for serious work requiring internet access, however, as the wifi access remains intermittent at best."
5,"What can I say ?  This is awesome.  I am a donut fan and would give Dunkin 4 stars, just like this place.  Great variety, great coffee, fresh donuts.  The extra 1 star comes for the fluffiness of their dough.  Its very fluffy and its done just right.   Dunkin is good but its donuts will taste a little hard and ""old"" when they have been sitting for a while.  For some reason, the Bosa donuts dun get too hard, even after U buy and drive for like 1/2 hour home.  I know its not located in the best part of town, but they are open 24 hrs and there is a drive thru.  They accept credit cards and discover :)"
5,One word: PISTACHIO... in all its glory... no need to say more.
4,"The rumors are true, this place was an awesome continental breakfast. Its not the usual Costco Danish +  some small cereal boxes.  They had 4 hot buffet trays with eggs, sausages, potatoes, several coffee flavors and a waffle maker with all the condiments and more! The service was quite good and the rooms were clean and not cheap looking.  My family booked it the night before and we got a surprisingly fair price.   Its right next to the Glendale Stadium stores, so be wary when the Cardinals are playing at home.  The location is ideal for Glendale and downtown trips.   Stop by for an superb breakfast on a budget to start a fun day in Phoenix."
5,"We happened upon this place on Sunday. We had our 2 1/2 year old with us and she was yelling about being hungry. We quickly ducked into Zinburger. All three of us had burgers. The kids burger was huge and it came with fries. We also ordered the sweet potato fries. The people around us had milkshakes and they looked delicious. I also noticed fried zucchini and figure next time Ill order those instead of fries.  We were in a rush and had something at 6 pm. We told the waiter we were in a hurry. He was great, friendly and accommodating. We were seated next to the hostess stand and my daughter kept trying to engage the folks standing there. Everyone was so nice.  My constructive feedback would be that I ordered my burger medium well and I received it medium rare. It still tasted yummy and I ate it. Had it been served that way to my hubby - he would not have been able to stomach the red juice flowing from the burger."
3,A very  good sandwhich shop!  My boy and I stopped in here after a movie at the AMC.  They have a neat concept with the bags on the wall where you mark your items. My only wish is that they had cold sandwhiches as well as the toasted variety.  I am not always (rarely in fact) in the mood for a toasted sandwhich. The italian sandwhich I got though was delicious. NOM NOM NOM
4,Another lovely mom and pop with fabulous authentic thai.  The prices are very reasonable and Ive never had a problem with the service.
2,I was not happy with the service department.  Service writer had a poor attitude towards helping me.  Repair work was done well and on budget but it is sad how a greeter can sour you on the whole place.
5,Dr. Lee does excellent work and he and the staff are very friendly and professional.  The best dental care I have ever received and I have lived all over the country and grew up at the dentist with my bad teeth.  They work very well with children also.
4,"Very casual.    Great white alfredo pizza.  We get it with mushrooms, onions and ricotta.  So yum!  Very pleasant staff.  Delivery - quick!  Salads are just okay.  Standard - w/ iceburge lettuce  Its really for the pizza that we go."
4,"I know my 2 girlfriends that absolutely LOVE this place will balk at my 4 stars instead of 5. But honestly, I think this place is slightly overrated. Dont get me wrong, I like this place, and I oblige them every time they want to go, but I think 4 stars is just right for the rating.  We went there this weekend, and the typical scenario went down. Parking was cramped (lucked out to get a ""valet"" spot which I parked into myself as it was right out front by the entrance - no Im not waiting for you Mr. Valet Dude to get into my car and pull it forward into the spot right in front of my face, thank you very much), and there was a short wait (maybe 10-15 minutes). We sat outside, which wasnt ideal since it was cold and drizzly, but we had patio heaters on both sides of our table so it was OK.  Sadly we didnt make their $5 wine special, which ends at 5pm, so we were paying full price for the glasses of wine - ranging from $8 to about $12-13. I dont know about you, but I really am not a fan of paying $10 for a glass of wine when I can pay that for an entire bottle. But alas, I had 2 different wines through the course of the night, both on recommendation from the servers, and both decent.  We ordered the infamous bruschetta, with the 4 choices being: smoked salmon (YUM!), warm artichoke (tasty), roasted red pepper (still good), and white bean with tomato (OK, but nothing to write home about).  For dinner, I had the half & half combo (where you get to choose 2 different items), and I chose the mixed green salad (REALLY delicious, with an awesome combination of greens, pears, grapes, gorgonzola cheese, pecans, & poppyseed dressing) and half of a turkey/pesto pannini. The pannini was QUITE boring. Didnt have much flavor at all. I think it was lacking on the pesto.  And honestly, this is what I come to expect at Postino. Some things are just unbelievable and you want to lick your plate clean, and other things are simply boring and tasteless (like the white bean/tomato bruschetta and the turkey/pesto pannini).  And hence my rating of 4 stars rather than 5. If the parking was easier, the wines were always $5 a glass, and the food was consistent, I would give it 5 stars. Fair enough?  :)"
3,"I have been to this location several times because again, right around the corner from my salon. I so want to be able to give it a higher rating but every time I go the service is really not that great. Last week I went for wing and Wii night, 30 cent wings cant be beat. I have had better wings, but hey this is a Mexican joint and our bill was not even $4! But our waitress looked like she could care less about being there, never asked if we wanted a refill on our chips and salsa and never stopped by the table to see if we like our food. Now being in the service industry and having spent many years as a server I get that you think since the bill is so low your tip is going to suck. That simply doesnt have to be the case, we left our server a $6 tip and we werent even there long. You get 4 tables like that an hour you are set, so perk up and smile, you never know how far that can go.  I went there last night for Taco Tuesdays, $1 to $2 tacos cant be beat and the tacos are so tasty I always order 3, the mahi, crunchy fish and steak. The mahi was flaky and sweet, the crunchy taco had a sweet taste to it with the sauce and red onion. Not greasy at all. The steak was tender and flavorful. Again though our service was sub par. We had already finished our chips and salsa before we even got our water, took way to long, same with the food and it wasnt even that busy. We were sitting inside and there were only 20 people in the bar area and there was only one other table eating. Now our server wrote our order on her had, she seemed tired and frazzled, and we had to bring our bill to her at the end to check out, we waited a while before doing that. It seemed like she might have been the only server in the place, but she did have the help of a gentleman by the name of Frenchy. I liked Frenchy, big dude but with dry wit and he seemed like the jack of all trades for the place. Doorman, food runner, busser, you name it he was doing it.  I will continue to come to Loco because the tacos are so damn good but I just hope they figure out the staff issues. I gave it 4 times and every time my complaint is the same, the service needs to step it up."
5,Best breakfast in west Chandler!  I love their crepe eggs and calorie/nutritional info printed on the menu.
2,"Phoenix is lacking in good Indian restaurants, and that is compounded if youre in the mood for South Indian food. Cafe Krishna is a perfect example. I would come here again on occasion only because I often crave South Indian and there are no superior alternatives.  I ordered the sambar-vada. The vada was not as hearty or flavorful as I would ordinarily expect. It was also served somewhat lukewarm. The chutneys were mediocre. The vada was a bit too soft for my liking. Dosa is harder to screw up, so I enjoyed that a bit more, but still nothing out of this world.  The service was poor, unprofessional and a bit chaotic. The environment and atmosphere were good. I was not impressed by the cleanliness of the bathrooms, which for me is always a bad sign for what must be the cleanliness level of the kitchen."
5,"This is the second time Ive eaten here and it was as good if not better than the first.  The first time I had the meat lasagna and the second time I had the cheesesteak. Lemme tell you this is one of the best Italian places Ive been to in Phx. Its very Back East feel to it and I love all of the authentic Italian foods they have there, especially the meat, cheese and pasta counters. Check em out you wont be disappointed!"
4,"M-Troniks repaired a 1970s Fender Bassman 10 for me.  They re-coned the speaker, letting the stock speakers remain.  They also replaced the tubes and adjusted them.  New longer cord as well.  They fixed this old thing up!   Crazy guitars for sale and other odds and ends."
5,I almost wish I hadnt discovered this place because its so good! Tons of flavors and every kind of topping you could want (even cake frosting)  So much better than MoJo and to top it off the staff couldnt have been nicer.
4,"i cannot give this place 5 stars because i went there today at 3:30 and IT WAS CLOSED.  what business closes at 3?  REALLY?  oh phoenix, youre killing me. BUT the food (creative, delicious sandwiches and desserts), speedy service, and reasonable prices really do deserve 5 stars.  The chicken/asparagus/havarti sandwich almost killed my taste buds with its deliciousness.  i went for carry-out at a peak time (about 12:30) and TOTAL, from joining the 6-person line to walking out the door, I probably spent about 15 minutes there.  very fast service=very happy jenny. i didnt get dessert, but i will be back on a day when im feeling either very fit or very depressed.  maybe tomorrow, due to my 3 PM CLOSE TIME funk.  crimeny.  :)"
4,"Its been awhile since this place was reviewed... and probably just as long since my last visit.  In the last few months (or possibly more), this restaurant changed names (it was previously The Counter) and cleared out the retail boutique area to make room for more seating. Future yelper Nancie S suggested we meet for lunch here today, and I was impressed with the changes.  By no means is Chloes Corner a high end restaurant... its more like a retro diner with a modern feel.  Its the kind of place you order at the counter and pay for it, and then they bring your food to your table when its ready.  Its also great for those who want to pick up something quick on the go... We both ordered the chopped salad and a side of toasted cranberry walnut bread.  It was really tasty!  You can tell they use high quality ingredients... the salad is a unique combination of field greens, turkey, bleu cheese, walnuts, and grapes with poppyseed dressing.  I would for sure order it again although the tuna melt looked pretty amazing too!  There are several other classic items on the menu such as grilled cheese, tomato soup, milkshakes, etc... Even more impressive than the lunch was the fact that I found a parking spot right away at Kierland and I left without going into one single store.  Im so proud of myself for that... any fellow shop-a-holics know how hard that can be! Although I did like this place when it was ""The Counter,"" it looks to me like the change that Fox Restaurant Concepts made to this restaurant was a good one!"
5,"Stingray Sushi is where we go for sushi . Sleek ,beautiful interior and very ,very clean ! This dining house has large 13 or so foot doors that when open ,seamlessly link the patio potion with the interior dining area ,a very good design flow,indeed. The patio itself is very comfortable as it has great seating . The service has always been wonderful ,the sushi very fresh with beautiful presentation .We like to get the sushi boat , edamame ,and beef yakitori.The fire dragon rolls( though on the small side) are also yummy. Drinks are very good here ..the sinful orchid (yum)a very pretty drink .And their HH is really good as well ."
2,"Weve eaten at Arriba a few times now.  I really dont care for their food, and service is slow more often than not.  The first time we went we were there it took a good two hours!  And thats not because were slow eaters.  We did stop in for happy hour last week though, and although their margaritas arent the greatest, theyre decent enough!  They ofter a 12 oz. house margarita for .99 or a 24 oz. grande for 4.99.  Why people would pay five times as much for a marg twice the size, I dont know.  We each had three .99 margs, ate the chips, salsa and bean dip and our bill came to 5.94.  $6 and I left with a full stomach and a buzz.  Nice!"
3,"Sometimes I really wish I could live in Scottsdale. I met up with two girlfriends there and we had a great time! This visit was a solid 3-4. We went in to take advantage of their happy hour (if you dont the prices seem wayyyy to steep for me). Anyway, if you take advantage of their happy hour you must sit either in the outside patio or the lounge. Now the outdoor patio was beautiful! Prettiest outdoor seating I have seen ever. But not when it is 104 out. (and there are no misters). Why did we sit outside do you ask? Because the bar area (which is tiny) filled up super fast (duh. its yummy!) The indoor ambiance is beautiful. (a little dark) The most awesome lights ever are in there. The service was good and the location is nice (right next to the free parking too!) I tried the featured white wine, and whatever it was (sorry I forgot) was good! My friend tried the sangria, but I was not a fan. Weird flavor compared to most sangrias that I cant describe.  Now onto the food. People who raved about the flatbread pizzas...I have no idea what you are talking about.  I had the margharita and it was just not good. Soggy and flavorless. The hummus was very yummy. Needed more pita with it. Now onto the star of the show: the bruschetta. The vine ripe tomato is yummy. The apple caponata is just as yummier, and the prosciutto and fig was also excellent! Ohhhh so yummy! This is the place to get bruscetta and wine after a long day."
5,"Of course, they are no La Madeliene, but if you are looking for some good croissants, this is the place to be. I love, love, love their croissants. But which bakerys croissants do I not love? hmm... But I do love theirs. I have had the almond croissant, the almond and chocolate croissant and finally today when we went there, I had the chocolate croissant. It was just freaking amazing. Thats all I can say. (They run out of the chocolate almond croissants pretty quickly so go early if you want some) I have also had lunch here before, some Mediterranean sandwich stuff. The portion is very small compared to the price. Their macaroons look crazy and funky. Have not tried them yet but plan on doing so next time. I almost gave them 4 stars because their hours they are open are very weird. But its okay, I will compromise Essence Bakery.  They only use butter imported from Normandy in their Croissants. Wow."
4,"Yumm!  Thai tea, spicy Thai beef salad, number 23a and a 32, all of it was delicious! I recommend this place. Just dont go in a hurry because you will be there a while"
4,"RnR strikes me as a casual, urban place to meet up for drinks and a bite to eat. Its not what comes to mind when I think old town Scottsdale, but places like this popping up are helping to change my mind about the area. Unfortunately after I was finished I was reminded that its still old town when I walked by a pan flute band on Main St. The old town parking corral is directly behind RnR, you can get to it from the alley next to RnR or off of 2nd Street. The space has a refreshing, industrial feel. I was impressed by the thought put into the seating options. Inside mostly features traditional high top tables for four, but I noticed they had a table near the bar that could seat at least 12. The downstairs patio features another bar, and both table and lounge chair seating. The upstairs patio has the best date seating, lots of tables for two. There was a lot of staff working during my visit. The host was friendly, and my waiter was attentive. My water was never empty and I got my sandwich in under 10 minutes. If anything they were a little too eager to please. I was both impressed and bemused when my waiter refilled my water glass, apparently noticed my ice had mostly melted, then returned with a scoop of ice to add to my cup. I just got a grilled cheese (which includes tomato and bacon) on my visit, I had dinner plans later but I was interested in feeling this place out. I really enjoyed it. The bread is cut pretty thick, which made me a little nervous. But it had a wonderful texture, and after a few bites I decided it worked for me and didnt overpower the delicious sharp cheddar and bacon like I expected. I look forward to returning to try other meals, and to sample what the bar has to offer. I understand RnR will have both late night hours and breakfast service. This is a great place to visit any time of day, but Im excited about having a new, good place I can frequent after (or during) a night out."
5,"Dont usually give 5 stars, but this is good sushi. At first, I was a little skeptic of all the macadamia nuts on their sushi, but it is a great compliment. The rolls are original and all very good. The Climax(s) and the Elliot are my favorite."
4,"As the mom of  2 kids (a 3 year old and a 8 month old) it seems to be very difficult to find a nice place to eat that is very comfortable and casual- and somewhere that people dont give you evil looks and comments  for bringing kids (Carrabas). We have been here a few times for lunch and the food has always been good. Not great, but pretty good and inexpensive. I will say though that their french fries are some of the best Ive had! I would much rather come here than IHOP"
2,"Cheap. Cheap. Cheap. Everything here is disposable, from the furniture to the linens to silverware. (Silverware rusted after one cycle in the dishwasher!).  So if you like to redecorate often and have a minimal budget this place is for you.  As far as their food, Ive only had a cinnamon roll here and it was stale. Bummer. My biggest annoyance here are the people who seem to be beached out on all the couches/beds/chairs. Dont you have homes?"
3,"The cajun seasoning on my salad was terrible, but everything else was just fine. But food aside, Id come here again for the atmosphere. Its not my scene, but I enjoyed how friendly the waitress was. I was surprised that she didnt know what an old fashioned was (my barometer of how good a bar is), but the bartender did and gave me a drink that was well balanced, but needed way more alcohol. Old fashioneds are not orange and look and taste like juice! It was fun watching the girl buck around on the mechanical bull. I have a feeling that the operator liked jiggling her around for a reason though...All in all an enjoyable dinner with friends."
4,I go to GB for the balcony and the hefeweisen.  One a warm sunny day there arent many places I would rather relax.  Watching the people on Mill Ave as well as the planes flying into Phx can kill a few hours if you are bored.  The food is ok.  The hummus appetizer is usually a safe choice as is the pizza.
2,"Ill agree that this is a great meet up place in the city. Nice neighborhood, adequate parking in the structure behind, and a greta atmosphere with great service. The menu is interesting and Id come back to try more but heres what our first visit was like. As a Starter we had the Spinach Quesadilla made with Lavosh and it was great. I mean really great and enough as a meal for two. For that alone Id go back. My better half had the Falafel Pita and thought it was OK.  I had the Gyros Pita and got luncheon meat. Im talking precisely sliced, straight from the fridge but thrown on the grill to warm-up luncheon meat. If you go online to see the menu, its one of the items you can click for a nutrition chart. Heres what it reads for the ""meat"" Gyro Beef [Beef, Lamb, Water, Bread Crumbs (Bleached Wheat Flour, Water, Dextrose,Salt and Yeast may contain soy bean oil, Calcium Propionate), Soy Protein Concentrate, Less thean 2% Salt, Garlic and Onion Powder, Monosodium Glutamate, ]; So, the takeaway here is stay away from the Gyro.  But, Hey!  Gyro IS a pita. I expected a reasonable execution. Heck, make a Gyro meatloaf and slice it up at least.  Yes, Im bitter."
4,"I have stopped in here for lunch and drinks a few times now. The teriyaki beef/chicken and bulgolgi have great flavor (I prefer the spicy versions). Their bowl meals come with plenty of meat and rice, while the bento meals also come with macaroni and slaw. These are affordable dishes and excellent for a lunch of easy take-out dinner. In addition, the meals are big enough that two people could split one. The other item that I really like here is the boba. The milk tea and Thai iced tea both have a nice tea flavor and are not overly sweet like some places. Hence, its also a nice place to pass by for a drink."
3,"Arrived around 5pm one Wednesday evening. The place is not in a nice area of Phoenix, and it looked deserted, and I was going to leave, when I saw a Mercedes and Lexus pull up.  So I thought Id give it a chance. The prices were somewhat reasonable, I got the Lo-Los for $11 (2 waffles, and 3 pieces of fried chicken). The food was tasty for what it was, but I only give it 3 *s because its just so unhealthy.. kool-aid, waffles, syrup, and fried chicken! This is the kinda a place I may go once a year, but I just feel so guilty!  Not sure what the syrup was, but it certainly wasnt real maple syrup (Id imagine it is some sugar based creation), and the waffles were dry. The chicken wasnt very moist, it was also a bit on the dry side."
4,"If youre looking for a good meal with solid service youll find it here.  The menu has something for everyone, too.  If you like to go out for lunch or brunch, this is a great place to go.  Friendly, fast staff helps make the experience that much better."
4,"Lams Seafood Market is a rare Asian gem in the Westside.. sort of like me ;-) haha just kidding.  I love this place! Great prices, fresh seafood :-) They also have a wide assortment of Filipino products which is a MUST for my kitchen.  The parking lot is a lil shady and could use some covering for the potholes."
5,"I have no idea why I havent dined or noshed during happy hour at this place more often, Ive always had great service, great wine, and great food. There is no adequate excuse , but anyway, my third adventure here made me update my review to 5 stars because 5th and Wine has earned it. The wines by the glass range from $8 - $11 unless you come in before 6pm then they are only $5! Those prices alone should make you want to come here for drinks with friends. The servers have always been cool with offering samples if you cant make up your own mind between two wines despite the recommendation from the server and your friend saying ""just pick one!"". Due to this fact, Ive always had a glass that I have enjoyed, which is usually a Zinfandel.  I have now had the pleasure of experiencing all of their different types of bruschetta. My top two favorites are the Prosciutto, Mascarpone, Figs, and Tomato Jam which has a great combination of salty and sweet, and the Apples, Brie, and Fig Jam one which is on the sweeter side, but not overwhelming because the bread and the tart granny smith apple slices help balance out the flavor. The Chopped Salad is very light and refreshing option to accompany the brushcetta appetizer. 5th and Wine is also a restaurant so other food options are available, I have sampled the Chicken and Pesto Pasta which has a delicious cream sauce and their Mac & Cheese which is super rich with the two types of melted cheese, but both items are delicious. The atmosphere is great whether you are sitting inside or outside. The lighting is soft, giving more of an intimate feel, yet this place still remains simple and casual, which I love. The outside patio is great, it is a courtyard that offers peeks into store windows while remaining private from the traffic of Old Town. The times I have been here it has never been super crowded and I am able to just walk in and be seated right away. 5th and Wine still feels like a hidden gem and you must try it out!"
4,"Fun trivia! Food is mediocre. Crowd was cool and there is plenty to do there (video games, darts etc..) When Im back in Tempe visiting friends I know well be back. Bonus for having the misters and a great seating area outside. We met some very nice locals who were up for a good chat."
2,"If Ive come to your Starbucks over 30x within 5 months and you still dont bother learning how to pronounce my name correctly then I dont know what to say. I always order the same drink: quad espresso with 3 pumps of white mocha and 80% of the time they dont get my order right! The baristas always ask if I want water or milk with it.. Seriously? I ordered a damn espresso for a reason. If I wanted water or milk then I wouldve ordered something else and NOT an espresso! And my drink is one of the simplest drinks to make too!! Just brew 4 shots, mix in white mocha syrup and add ice.. But they always somehow mess up by asking me stupid questions. If it werent  for this sb being the closest to school, I would definitely frequent the Thunderbird location!"
1,"AWFUL.  Not sure it classifies as food.  Burrito consists of a flour tortilla and meat.  No salsa, beans, cheese, sour cream, guacamole.  Nada.  Plus they wont let you add anything to it.  Everything is as is.  The cheese enchalada had cheese but it was not gooey and melted.  The food was barely luke warm.   Service is also mediocre.  The salsa was gross.  It was super water down.  The best part of the meal was my Pepsi."
5,"Over the top cheesesteaks. Best in Phoenix, perhaps the world. Amazing food and friendly service. Best ever."
4,"NO!  The only good dim sum in town, however, yesterday we went and there was a sign on the door that the landlord had shut them down and changed the locks for failure to pay rent."
5,I love this second location in the Royal coffee series as much as the one at the market! Since its summer - I thought I should mention that the iced coffee is so smooth and amazing that you dont even have to add anything to it!! Dont believe me?  Ask for a sample next time you are here and I guarantee you will be astounded! A quiet and chill atmosphere if you want to work/study/read as well as a great place for delicious grab n go coffee in the Biltmore area!
3,"Third time back.  This is my 9 year old daughters favorite restaurant for special celebrations.  Maybe because the portions are sized for her.   Just kidding.  Sort of. Always good food.  Sometimes terrific.  But never consistently, hit the ball out of the park good.   The bill creeps up on you.  We cant ever seem to walk out the door with less than $80-120 bill for 2-3.   Last night, had the filet.  At maybe 5 ournces, bigger and more substantial than the last time, when I think I paid $32 for 2 ounces.  Seriously. Last time the steak was perfect.  This time, they overcooked it, but I didnt have the heart to send it back.  So my wife ate it and enjoyed it, and I got her salmon. Salmon was just okay.  BUT, the bed of rissoto, one of my favorite dishes, was delightfully rich and creamy. Overall, its not a terrible value.  And its a cute little french restaurant.  COMPLETELY and totally not appropriate for small children, so dont even try.  Great date place. Whatever you do, you MUST try two things:   1) Onion Tart - its just a slice and a side salad as an appetizer, but OH what a slice. 2) Berry Tart - the deserts are what makes this place go.  Save room.   Remember this: IF YOU GO TO A RESTAURANT WITH TART IN ITS NAME, AND DONT ORDER A TART... well, what can I say.  Just dont do it. Will be back, as I always have, and will promise to only feel slightly mugged next time I pay the bill."
4,"Reviews of this place are all over the board, but I always eat there when I do my yearly Scottsdale gallery crawl. The food and ambience, a series of indoor and outdoor patio rooms, are quaint and very satisfying, with good size portions, and a very friendly staff. At least to me they are. I was last there in late November and had the days special, enchiladas in a poblano sauce which was quite good. The salsa is spiced just right."
4,"Treated my sister-in-law to a message here on Super Bowl Sunday.  They have great hours & were very accommodating even though we only made our appts about 24 hours in advance.  When we booked, the receptionist (who was really helpful and nice) mentioned the groupon promotion ($40 for $100 worth of services) as well as SpaFinder gift cards.  We thought we could combine them, and we arrived at our appt to find that they werent supposed to combine discounts.  But the receptionist made an exception and we were really appreciative! The massage was nice, could have used a little more pressure.  Cute atmosphere and friendly/helpful staff.  I would come back, especially with SpaFinder/discounts."
4,"I had always heard great things about Pita Jungle, but it wasnt until a recent visit there that I became a believer. Really great food for a reasonable place!"
3,"Very good food but a little overpriced for the amount of food you get so the price is the only reason I am giving it a 3 star instead of a 4 star.  Cost about $11.50 for a small sandwich side salad and an ice tea.  All the food seems to be of the organic nature so definitely taste is higher quality. I have been there 3 times and each time left still hungry; however, did feel that I had a healthier lunch than other options in the area. If you are in the mood for a high quality / healthy light lunch and okay with paying $10-12 per person definitely give Essence Bakery a shot."
4,Love the medium wings and green salad with thousand island dressing!  The bartender CJ is da bomb!
4,"My husband and I frequent this restaurant quite a bit. We use to be huge fans of the Ahi Tuna burger with sweet potato fries (the fries rock). Unfortunately, they removed the Ahi Tuna burger from the menu which was very disappointing. I do like the Tiki fish sandwich though. I do which that they would included a fish sandwich on their lunch menu on the weekend. Although, when I have gone for lunch on the weekend and have asked if they can make a fish sandwich they have always accommodated me.  I would give this place 5 star, but I think their one weakness is their brunch menu. I took a friend there for lunch because we loved their dinner and lunch menu so much, but it was very disappointing. We ordered Bloody Marys and had to send them back because the horseradish was overwhelming. In fact, all you could taste was horseradish, no tomato juice or anything. All three of us sent them back and they could remake them because they were part of a batch that they pre-mixed - UGH! Plus, I was the only one that liked my breakfast. My husband and friend were not impressed.  Also, I adore their Hawaiian fish ceviche - yum!!"
1,"ok so heres what they teach:  if you are a good person it is right and good for you to take from others and give it to yourself, because you deserve it and everyone else is a bad person.  Stealing is okay, lying is okay, as long as it is done by you, but for the others, they have no place in society, so pillage and destroy them, it is your right and you will be rewarded for that.  Wow."
5,Walking in was like seeing a rainbow for the first time. UH-mazing! Every type of candy ever created and more candies that youve never even heard of. Best part about it was that it was super affordable. It was like a mini-costco of just candy.  I ended up going twice on Saturday. Love it!
3,"After a business trip, I reeeeeally needed a massage. Facility was alright. I personally think it needs an upgrade.  Right off the bat, the area with the lockers (and really where you would get nakey!) is very public...thats the first area that everyone walks through. The outside lounge area was also VERY tiny.  I went out there and walked right back in because it was full with little privacy.  By that I mean I walked out there and BAM!  A large naked woman scared me back inside.  Really?  G. D. people!  Im trying to relax.  Naked out of shape people stress me out!  Just ONCE, I want to see a naked hot person walking around.  And if a woman goes nakey, do some basic maintenance first although that much hair does prevent seeing everything, so it may be a blessing...ugh, you know what?  Just stay clothed.  Please? But my masseuse totally made up for that.  60 minutes of amazing...I forgot all about business and naked people who should be naked in private! 3 stars because Joelle worked magic! She was great and super friendly.  Even though the facilities werent the best, I would consider returning for her massage."
3,"I hate having to give out three star reviews. For me, 1-star isnt the worst possible rating you can an establishment, a 3 is. Because 3 stars means it invoked no reaction to you, neither joy or disgust, no pleasure or pain.  Id rather eat at a really shitty place that Ill remember than a so-so eatery that Ill forget the moment I get back into my truck. If I want mediocre ""take it or leave it"" food Ill just cook for myself, kthxbye. As BFeFs (Best Frienemies Forever), Clarice W and I frequently have lunch together in the Peoria area. The decision on what to eat is usually made using the following criteria: Where havent we been that we can yelp about? Our last lunch involved us going to Hope Kee and getting all wrapped up in their cutesy snack section and coming in late to work. So we needed somewhere relatively closer with no Hello Kitty gummi lips to distract us from our voyage back. Clarice suggested Casa Filipina, a Filipino place by the Lennys Burger somewhere near but not necessarily 35th Avenue. We were welcomed in by the staff and taken immediately to a nice cozy table by the window. We were given our menus by the excited and talkative waiter I would come later to know as ""that fucking guy"".  At first I was a little troubled reading the menu. I was once in a relationship with a Filipino girl that was so tumultuous and unloving that when I seriously thought of breaking up with her that my first thought ""but  man, I love her mothers cooking..."".  But aside from the adobo and lumpia, I saw nothing else on the menu that I could recall from all those awkward awkward family dinners. I cant tell if this means theres more to the cuisine than Im aware of or that said exs mother was, as well as a good cook, a fucking liar.  Either way, Im glad I left her in the end anyway. I ordered the Dinguan, which translates as ""chocolate pork"". Dont be fooled by the name, all you saucy foodies out there thinking of that Iron Chef America where they made savory dishes with chocolate. Chocolate pork is actually pork cooked in pigs blood.  Ill repeat that. Its pigs blood. Its called ""chocolate pork"" because the blood takes on a brownish-black hue after its been cooked. After hearing this from that fucking guy, Clarice changed her original order (we even order the same thing! arent we just the cutest!) to the Bistek Tagalog, which she was familiar with and knew she would like. All the entries come with at CFB is a side of ride. Im not sure if its jasmine, white, or saffron, because I always opt for noodles when given the option.  And if you get that fucking guy, that rice doesnt even come with soy sauce. After serving us, he disappeared into the bakery, talking it up with some of the other customers. Clarice didnt get her soy sauce until after we had finished our entrees and were on our second helping of rice.  Thankfully my chocolate pork came with a lot of sauce and I was able to dribble it on my rice.  Thats right, muchachos. We trannies prefer blood on our rice. You think about that the next time you try to tell us what bathrooms we can use, amigo. I couldnt taste the pork. All I tasted was the blood. They couldve just dumped a quart of blood on my rice and called it a day. The texture was nice though. Clarice wasnt as fortunate with her dish. While Ive tried to stay away from beef (its enough of a commitment to keep my vegetarian brother off my back but not interfere with my eating habits), I had some of the Bistek, and it was passable. It reminded me of beef jerky, with its dry spicy roughness. Good, but not sure if thats how its meant to taste. Moral of the story: Clarices entree did NOT make its own gravy, which made eating her rice a little inconvenient.  And seriously, JUST rice (really good rice, but seriously, how hard is it to make good rice)? Even my neighborhood so-poor-it-steals-its-recipes-from-other-restaurants Chinese place gives you an eggroll or wonton with your meal.  As the place is so fucking proud of its desserts, we ordered some. Clarice got the Creme Brulee and I got the mango tart. That fucking guy was in the middle of bringing Clarice her spoon when he caught the attention of another customer, so we sat for a good few minutes waiting to dig in. In the meantime, I managed to come up with a name for the color of the filling in my tart : burnt earwax.  My tart was about as tasty and edible as that term would imply. Clarices creme brulee was good, albeit a little cold by the time that fucking guy came with her spoon. On our way out I learned that the bill had to be over 10 dollars before they would accept debit. After I imagined beating every one of the staff near to death with a rolling pin, I got an eclair to go. What I got was a bunch of whipped cream between two pieces of rock-hard pastry that youd get at Frys. Essentially, a diabetes sandwich. Casa Filipina isnt good. But its not bad. Thats the proble"
5,"I am a huge Suns fan but my review is about the fundraising options that the Suns have to offer as well as their back-office staff. First and foremost, talk about a professional, classy organization. Whether you have fundraising experience or are a total novice, the staff treats you like you are the only group they are working with. My contact is Kyle Pottinger and he is always a gentleman. No matter what questions I have, he always answers them promptly and never makes me feel like Im bothering him.  The fundraising process is easy and the tickets practically sell themselves because who doesnt want the chance to purchase discounted tickets?  The process is easy and the rewards can be lucrative depending on the target audience you are working with. The Suns will treat you professionally and courteously. You wont be disappointed."
4,"If you can avoid the vintage smell youre golden.  I walked in - smelled grandmas place with a hint of Goodwill and decided to get myself acclimated and walked about the store. They have quite the selection of vintage furniture, jewelry, and clothes. I fell in love with a few jackets but was all about trying some phosphates and getting my munch on.  Playing it safe I first ordered the cherry lime phosphate BUT holy carbonation they have a long list of flavors that all sounded if not yummy definitely interesting.  The food is so good - my chicken salad sandwich was fantastic and came with the best potato salad Ive ever had (dont tell my mom).  I was going to order the champagne phosphate but my pinup girl waitress steered me into getting the pineapple. It was so sweet and not very pineappley but still good.  For the lady who made a post about no french fries I just want to say, really???  Its nice to have other options and they keep it simple, unique and delicious. I cant wait to share this place with my friends and family."
5,"This place is what Desert Ridge wishes it was! Its great for groceries (Wal-Mart), bargain hunting (TJ Maxx), fast food or dining in (tons of places!), catching a movie (Harkins), stocking up the wine shelf (BevMo), new panties (Vickys Secret) and a zillion other things. I love that this is close to my house! The only thing that would make it better is a Costco or Sams Club."
5,"Id leave my Scottsdale bubble for a few reasons (and yes there are additional exceptions) 1. Nobuo at Teeter House. 2. Fez. 3. My friends in various parts of the valley and  4. Mekong Supermarket. I consider myself to be a huge fan of Asian cuisine. Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Korean, Indian. You name it, Ill eat it. I have my healthy moments, but I am a seasoned eater and I am not afraid of exploring the world through my palate. Mekong is the perfect place for me to massage my senses. The aroma and sensations from the exotic product. The stunning visual of a catfish being bopped on the head, and then cut up and packaged. The cheesy elevator music on the loudspeaker. The delicious taste of a spring roll from the hot food bar.  This place has it all. I usually come here for my Asian condiments and live seafood. Want a live crab? Boom. Done. Want spicy mustard or sriracha in a large bottle for cheap? Its yours. To me, there is nothing like taking the 10 mile drive in traffic to Mekong because I know I am going to get everything I want.  Make the trek. You wont regret it."
5,"This is a dangerous place for me. I could seriously do my bank account some damage as I love love love this store! The candles are the best anywhere. They burn very clean and the fragrance lasts until they burn out. I just bought the kumquat scented candles and they smell delish. Theres so many cool home furnishings here as well, unique non-mainstream stuff thats fairly reasonable in $$. Ive actually got my eye on this really cool apothecary cabinet... purchasing it may be in my very near future!"
3,"i know theyre doing their jobs and i can understand that. but we couldnt shake our saleslady. we finally had to say that if she didnt leave us alone, we were going to leave. we absolutely couldnt discuss anything because she was CONSTANTLY THERE! we even said well come find you if we need any help. literally any piece we glanced at, touched, or came near, she was on top of us ""oh isnt this a great piece. we can set up financing and lock in the sales price, and if you buy 5k worth today with cash, well throw in...etc"". every single item.  they have nice stuff, no question about that. but i know this game. and its not fun. it makes shopping miserable. and besides, its too expensive for us. we got 3 of the same, exact pieces (same model, same sku) at pruitts for less than half we would have paid at Ashleys."
4,"Okay before I get into the drinks, Ill start with the food.  My fave is the peppered turkey avocado sandwich, with these delicious fries.   Or, (Amber: note the paragraph change) you could get the chili verde appetizer, or the grilled shrimp and guac tostada bites, or the tejas trio with guac, queso, and salsa and chips.   Bottom line is the food is solid, all the way up to the fruit cobbler for dessert.  Settle for nothing less.  For drinks, Z caps you at 3 margaritas so make it count with the chambord rita before you switch to beers.  Its good, youll be flavored, life is perfect."
5,Have alread posted a review but had to add that a friend at work ordered vegan chocolate cupcakes for my birthday and they were sooooooo delicious!! All my nonvegan coworkers LOVED them.
5,Heard about this restaurant from a friend and I was amaze by the food and their friendly service. I tried the chicken adobo and it was amazing! The chicken came apart with no effort and it had a great honey glazed taste. The portions were a good amount for their low prices. I couldnt  get enough of their amazing dessert!
4,Great place to go have a beer and watch the game on one of there numerous televisions.
5,"With our regular Indian place converted to buffet and my lunch companions refusing to go (dont tell them, but I would go anyway), it was time to find a new Indian spot for the work lunch rotation.  We were on a mission and I was trying to figure out whether Jewel would be added to the list of acceptable lunch haunts.  After managing a circuitous route to the top floor of a parking garage, we navigated a maze like structure of corridors to find the restaurant.  Travel time was starting to negate Jewel from the list.  The lunch menu was small, and we all ordered the thali meat combination.    After a modest wait time the food arrived in an array of metal containers and was delicious.  I hope we go back, but majority rules."
5,"LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!! Best Mexican food we have had in Arizona yet. We are partial as we just bought in Fountain Hills and its close, but its also small and although lively, never crowded or noisy. The service is friendly and fast and the Mexican style music is great but not too loud. You can easily talk and relax. Loved the guacomole dip and shrimp cocktail and the fried ice cream is fab and big enough for four people!!!"
5,"Ah what a beauty and wonder Camelback mountain is. However I do warn beginners to use the easier trail on the East side near Invergorden which runs north south and turns into 64th st. It is a bit of a walk from the parking through the neighborhood but the hike is less treacherous and much easier and takes you up a gradual slope to the top. Be very careful its easy to loose the trail on that side too.  Of course all the Phoenicians like to go to Echo Canyon at Mcdonald and 44th street bend. Parking can be bad at peak times on weekends--I definetely recommend late afternoon hiking, less exhaustion from heat, less crowds and a glorious sunset at the top.  Happy Hiking my Dear Phoenicians."
4,"Ive spent more time than I need to remember in hotel bars and restaurants, and they all kind of fade into a blurry, nebulous, mass.  District, however, stands out. From their pork sliders and bacon wrapped dates on happy hour, to their cold and juuust right gin martinis, I dont think they hit a flat patch the whole week I was there, and I stopped by at least once a day. The bartender I had, Matt, was funny, smart, sweet, and made me feel like I had a friend in Phoenix. The experience was more than I could have asked for from a hotel restaurant, and if I stay in the area again I will definitely go back."
5,This QT is one of my favorite locations! It is always very clean and the staff is upbeat!
5,One of my favorite places to come. Their salsa and guacamole is to die for. I like that they bring each person their own individual bowl of salsa.  I ways get their huevos rancheros with beans and rice + homemade flour tortilla. Delicious!!! I eat the entire plate every time.
4,Great prices and fresh food ...
4,"For those of you planning to visit us, Babaloos is no more.  For those of you who know us I just wanted to take a minute to leave a heartfelt thank you. When someone opens a new restaurant it is an exciting moment, a nervous moment, a scary moment all rolled into one.  If the worst thing that happens is a rack of wine glasses falling from the roof in a hail of glass then the opening can be considered a success-many have endured far more nightmarish openings in this industry.   As the weeks, months, and years go by a funny thing happens to the special restaurants, the good restaurants: they begin to feel like family and people come back.  This was where I came in, almost a year ago today, as a simple restaurant server with over 10 years of previous restaurant management experience.  I was not the best server, but I noticed that both customers and employees alike were always grateful, and made me feel at home.  This was the beauty of Babaloos-it felt like family.   To Robert, Myra, George, Adam, Emily, Jon, Rob, Erika, and anyone I may have forgotten I offer my deepest thanks for allowing me to be part of your lives.  To all of the wonderful people who came to see us over and over again, I would far prefer to work a table seated with people I know, and you all never failed to help me out with that.  Babaloos did not close because of the folks that supported us, it closed because sometimes in the bleakest economy a business fails, even despite the greatest efforts of those trying to keep it going.  It was a fun ride.  Thanks Rob!"
4,"Two times a year, you can meander down Mill Ave and the adjoining streets to look at an array of art for sale. Everything from jewelry and pop art posters to handmade kitchen utensils, photography and abstract paintings.  If you go both in Spring and Winter, youre likely to see a few of the same artists. For the most part, Tempe Arts Festival does a great job of providing variety. Plus, its fun to wander and look at things you may not have seen before - let alone expected to see at an arts festival.  This isnt the most exciting of art festivals. Theres really no live music, unless you count the occasional melodies of flutes you hear when you walk by the vendor selling his handmade wooden flutes.  Ive been three times and enjoyed myself every time. I wasnt wowed. I never saw anything I couldnt live without. But, like I said, this is a fun event to mark on your calender for both Spring and Winter - even if it happens to rain during the festival.  I give last Winters and this Springs festivals both a 4-star review, for the weather and company were great. It was my first year going, and I was happy to see that Tempe offered the Valley something that appealed to people who really do try and appreciate art. After all, its a ""consumer"" type of event, geared toward bringing the community and artists together. I can appreciate that.  I give this Winters festival a 3-star review. The rain didnt phase me. I can deal with a few sprinkles. What bothered me was the mixing of ASU and UofA fans, both groups beginning to gather down on Mill Ave for the football showdown. Dont get me wrong, I love a good sporting event and understand team rivalry. I just thought it was unfortunate that the upcoming game and the fans excitement took over the relaxed, casual feel that the arts festival usually has - you know, when you can walk down the street and look at art without running into an impromptu cheer section.  You see, fans were screaming in the streets - hollering insults to the other team - and waving their schools colors high. (Once again, I understand the fun of that. I just didnt expect it to be all over the streets in the early afternoon. Maybe Im naive, though.) The fans were a definite distraction from the art festival. Knowing what would happen when alcohol was mixed into the equation, my friend and I decided to bolt.  Lucky we did. Seems like Tempe cant handle a few rain droplets, for when we were walking back to the car, a street lamp post nearly fell on our heads. Talk about a commotion.  Id much rather attention be fixed on the art festival rather than any football game or falling lamp posts, no matter how dramatic both of those things can be. I spose this echoes the old saying, ""Theres a time and place for everything."" Word to the wise: Parking can be hard to find, or require you to shell out $10 for a spot. If you can, park somewhere closeby thats free of charge and hoof it on foot."
2,"The doctors are great, especially Dr Mouaikel but the set up to communicate is not patient oriented at all .  When the office is closed for lunch 12-2PM you cannot even leave a message .  You need to call back again and listen to the lenghtly preamble about directions , office hours, emergency numbers etc.  You still have to press the correct number and leave a phone number for a return call.  The return call is late that day or even the next day. The recording suggests yiu use the website yet you have to be signed up for the website and I cannot find out on the website how you get signed up.   I would rather go to the DMV rather than have to call the AIA office for other than an appointment.."
4,"Sadly, this Souper Salad has closed.     :-("
5,Amanda was very helpful when we looking at the ferrits.....   A great pet store.
4,"Impressed  , stopped 2 x before and the wait was to long . Made reservations for 5 this time.;).. Friends had recommened and raved about Becketts and had this on the short list for awhile. It was everything as advertised, ambiance very casual , GOOD Food, excellent service (  Adria was very good and made good recommendations ) and fair prices . Recommend the Osso  Bucco pork but not a bad meal by the group . Sunday is AZ winery special which is a nice touch , must try the Pimms cup cocktail excellent! Cant wait to go back!,!,"
3,"The parking situation is ridiculous, seriously. If you can, walk/bike/bus. Its not worth the energy/effort otherwise. Another downside? If you dont make 6 figures, dont plan on buying anything here. Seriously. Nothing lends itself to everyday people. Except for m                   aybe Borders (outside of food options). My most recent venture there was on a Fri afternoon and it was PACKED and we literally could not eat anywhere without a decent wait and we were starving... so we were stuck. The bonus is the MoJo, Borders & Paradise there. But nothing else lends itself to my medicore income."
1,"Id have to disagree with the person who said this restaurant is dog friendly.  I was told off by the owner because I had a little dog outside table and that was right after I finished paying for an overpriced breakfast dish and coffee.  I went here before that on several occasions and many times my order was forgotten, after paying....and the staff is real unprofessional blasting music at nightclub volume at early breakfast and lunch times.  Im a neighbor, but will never go here again!!!!"
2,This is a lake.   It has water in it.  Its not very clean water.   The lake police will yell at you if you let your dog swim in the water. That sucks.   I think its semi-retarded to review a lake.
4,"While my partner and I dont normally like chain restaurants Ling & Louies is an exception. Theyre a small chain of only two restaurants they are franchising.  We both started with Miso soup which was okay. Then we moved on to Potstickers, on of our favorites. they were very good, but not outstanding. For our entrees I ordered Firecracker Chicken with Broccoli and my partner ordered Meatball Sliders. The Chicken was VERY spicy, but also very good. I didnt have room to try the Meatball Sliders but here they were also very good. All-in-all it was a pretty good meal and the service was perfect."
5,"In my opinion, one of the best steakhouses in town.  My husband and I go here for all our special occasions and have never had one bad meal.  The service is the best just like their steaks.  I recommend the Caesar salad, fillet, creamed spinach, cream corn, garlic and lobster mashed potatoes.  We will continue our tradition and keep coming back here."
5,Sundae for Sunday. Pink spot helps me go through the summer heat.
3,"Its unfair to review this mall on what it was - since it no longer is (and what it is isnt as good as what it was). Its also unfair to review this on what it will be - since it isnt that yet.  Today, its a mall I rarely visit. Apart from a few stores I would visit out of convenience or necessity, theres not much to offer compared to what it used to have. The fantastic movie theater, Jutenhoops, Alpine Ski Keller, Bear Cover, and even Ed Debevics are all long gone... oops, there I go bringing up the past. Seriously though, these were painful to lose - one by one. So today, theres a Linens n Things which is hardly unique, and a Trader Joes which is nice to have in the area, and also a Sisters Attic and Closet upscale thrift stores which add a bit of much-needed flavor. The Chilis, the Bookstar, and Black Angus are still around. So is the jewelry store that has never really offered a compelling reason to enter. Theyve wedged an LA Fitness here and theyve also added a Blimpie and an Arbys... all very healthy choices.  Besides all of the generic shops and eateries and standard offerings, theres still a few unique experiences - though nothing like it used to... shit, there I go again. Anyway, so theres a few places that arent screaming ""standard mall"" such as Pita Grill, a pipe and tobacco shoppe (you have to spell it that way in this case), a place to get eyewear, and some other small and uninteresting businesses.  In that sense, I suppose this is has become a decent and convenient neighborhood strip mall. This is a shame really since its lacking most of the key elements that made it really special. Its still a beautiful outdoor mall and the architecture alone makes it a unique alternative to the cookie-cutter malls that strategically litter the landscape of America.  Im worried about what theyll do to the architecture when they renovate this place someday, but I think the fact that this mall isnt terribly interesting anymore in general means it wont be so terribly missed when they lose that last remaining bit of ""special."""
5,"I found this little hot spot on Yelp and used my phone to navigate me there; I wouldnt have found it otherwise.  This small establishment is hidden in a neighborhood right off of Historic Downtown Chandler.  Its a quaint little diner with modest décor.  I felt very comfortable there and the service was fast and friendly.  As I looked over the menu the first thing I saw was the Morning Monte and havarti cheese as one of the ingredients.  Cheddar isnt better; its all about havarti folks!  I neednt look further; I knew thats what I was having.  Hawaiian bread French toast, bacon, turkey, egg and the havarti - absolutely delicious!  Cant wait to come back and bring everyone I know."
5,I love this place. They are so accommodating and the food is delicious. They made a special meal for my daughter and were happy to do it. Our server was helpful and friendly.  I had the roasted beet salad and the ingredients were very fresh and tasty. I cant wait to go back.
1,"Im sad to report that we dined here for lunch and it was inedible:(  Chef Aaron please come by and monitor your staff.  We had the eggplant sandwich and is was a disaster.  It was so overly oily and the bun and fries overwhelmed the plate.  The shrimp and grits were so average with the shrimp being of low quality.  The beer menu looked fabulous.  So I guess if this is just a watering hole things will be fine...but if you choose to dine be prepared to leave hungry and unsatisfied.  We hope this turns around.  The decor is cool and the staff is really fun and helpful...and we are hopeful for a great place to visit in the ""hood""."
4,"I love this place, saves me and my family some serious cash. I do agree with allot of the other reviewers on the meat and produce - my wife gets those from the store across the street.  I also love the fact that they have a Sushi shop inside the store. Makes a great quick snack. The lady the works there will make almost anything you want. And, you can call in your ""order"" ahead if needed. She (or her son) have never let me down in quality and freshness of the Sushi."
5,"Chino Bandido is a staple for my sister and I. Im not going to lie, when describing this place I feel the need to mention that while its not much to look at on the outside--inside it delivers some of my favorite guilty pleasures. I encourage anyone who is trying this place for the first time to take a few minutes and allow the staff to guide you thru what they have to offer. With their complimentary taste test , you can try a few of their most popular dishes and learn how to order off of their moderately challenging menu (but once you get it, its super easy). I ALWAYS go for the combination of double jade red chicken, refried beans, and plain fried rice. The snickerdoodle at the end is perfectly baked. Every time. Love this place."
3,"Chain restaurant thats just about okay for afternoon dining with friends. If I wasnt having beer at lunch Id probably suggest eating someplace else. Food is good but in my experience their beer makes the meal. Ive eaten here about half a dozen times during the past few years when in town for business weekends. It is centrally located on the corner of Mill and Fifth Street in downtown Tempe, amongst quite a few other local restaurants. During my most recent visit I ordered a steak at lunch along with one of the seasonal brewed beers. Steak was okay but I wouldnt order it again. Beer was exceptional, so I wasnt unhappy overall. I love burgers and I think Ill stick to that as my primary choice when eating here in the future. I cant think of any times when service was particularly unsatisfactory, nor were there times when service really stood out as exceptional. I have almost always eaten here on a Saturday afternoon, and its typically been fairly busy during the lunch hour. Never had a problem getting a table, which is important since Im usually heading back for an afternoon conference session. I love the big glass beer mugs (not sure what size they are) but I cant always down the whole thing during a short lunch break (Im a lightweight). Overall, good place to eat if youre hungry and in the downtown area, but I wouldnt go out of my way to get here."
5,A great value for a far superior hair cut than are likely to get from a national chain.  We have been going to Tara for 3 years and she has created a warm and friendly environment that kids love.  There are plenty of TVs for kids to watch a show if they are not big fans of haircuts.
4,standard Target.
5,"I was there just last night, and today received a ROTD for my original review. Too weird. Updates - They mix a great margarita! No fluorescent green pre mixed Margarita mix - they make it themselves with fresh lime juice. Yum. The wine list is small but good. My current fave is the Argentinian Malbec.  Its only $6 a glass, and they pour generously. Very tasty wine. The seating is not comfy if you like to slouch. If you sit up straight, its fine. But seriously.... good posture is over rated. It gets a little cold in there once in a while during the winter. Wear long sleeves. :) After 3 glasses of the Malbec last night, I didnt care. This place has really been growing on me... nice to have such a great neighborhood watering hole!"
3,I am not going to complain about the quality of my manicure! They did a fabulous job...On the other hand their customer service was a little off. Very unorganized and they could just not get it together. It took them forever to assist us since we didnt have an appointment and are not regulars.
3,"I may have to disagree with the majority of reviews of this restaurant.  We came here after my parents played a round of golf. With their round they got two free steak dinner, which they raved about... not sure if it was more on the fact that they were tasty or that they were free, which today can be just as exciting.  I ordered the Coconut Shrimp with Sweet Potato Fries, and although this is a large plate of fried concoctions, it was delicious! I could not ask for a more crispy, summer-y meal.  There were some problems with the service, we had a dirty glass and a bad glass of wine. But they were very helpful in recognizing their fault and fixing the problem.  There was karaoke playing the night we were there, which was interesting, but not the creme of the crop participants if you catch my drift.  So if you are a  golfer and looking for a great place to go after your round, stop by."
5,"This is the best ice cream Ive ever had, bar none!  I had the salted caramel, and it was wonderful!  I felt like I was 7 years old and enjoying my first ever ice cream cone.  I also love the decor of the shop, the braille on the back wall is so cool (although I do wonder exactly what it says!)  I also bought a pint of their ice cream at Whole Foods, I love Sweet Republic and everything it stands for!  Totally recommended!"
5,"Great service, I didnt get steak from here (yes, I know...a steakhouse), just got the Zesty Thai Salmon. The salmon was awesome with the chili mayo, baked potato, and asparagus. Cant wait to go back to try their other dishes. Thank you Kathy (owner) for taking the time to send me the name of the dish! Had to update this review and rating because of it :D"
5,"I did not expect such a great find in a such a nondescript location. I went there looking for a very odd beer. Not only did they have it, they had tons of it. The guy behind the counter was helpful as soon as I walked in, and showed me exactly what I needed. They know what they sell very well, and can give excellent recommendations on whatever you might be looking for. It was great to talk shop with someone who obviously knew his stuff."
5,"Great selection, TONS of flavor, always hot and fresh, nice staff, great prices. In my top 3 quick restaurants."
4,"It was a Sunday morning & Mimis was PACKED! We walked in, gave the hostess our name & told the wait wouldnt be too long considering it was just the two of us. The décor was French quarter New Orleans-themed, with Parisian style knick knacks & art work abound. A bit on the kitchy side, but quite nifty IMO! What I found to be not only impressive but wise was that they had free coffee, mini muffins & sample size nut loafs for the waiting patrons, which mostly consisted of seniors & families.  Following the hostess to our table, I couldnt help but notice, the humongous portion size of ALL of their dishes.  The menu had so many mouth watering choices, but considering I was feeling ill, I ordered a bowl of granola & a (YU-MMY) buttermilk spice muffin. Boring I know, but lemme make it up to you by talking about moms dish, the 3 egg avocado & crab omelet which was made w/ jack cheese, tomatoes, scallions, bacon & asiago cream sauce, accompanied by red potatoes, choice of one of their mega-sized (hot & fresh) muffins & fresh squeezed O.J.  The service was on the slow side, perhaps understaffed or just overwhelmed, but our waiter made it up to us by giving me choice of beverage & extra muffins, no charge.  For those of you who want healthier options, dont you fret, they offer a Fresh & Fit menu as well.  All in all, I really enjoyed my dining experience @ this Mimis location & will definitely return if Im ever back in Phoenix."
5,"Screw Disneyland- Sephora is the happiest place on earth!  They have everything a girly girl or a girly guy could possibly dream of and then some! They have all the best brands in cosmetics, skin care and perfume and theyre always adding new items to their extensive product selection.  To me, getting a gift card to Sephora is like having Christmas morning over and over again.  Everywhere you look there are sparkly blushes, lip plumping glosses, lash-extending mascaras and anti-aging face creams- what more could anyone ask for? I can understand why men might hate going into Sephora- but they do have some products for guys too- although not many.  As far as I know, Scottsdale Fashion Square is home to the only Sephora in Scottsdale, but even as great as it is, it still cant beat the one right on the strip in Vegas.  Theyre open really late and you can shop with a drink in your hand- what could be better than that?"
5,"I rarely go to Indian restaurants. But this is a place I love to visit often. The food seems as if it was done with great interest. When u go there, order anything with rice. They cook it to perfection. I like their handi dishes a lot. If there is one thing I can suggest, it is that they should stop adding food coloring to some of their dishes. No need to guild this Lilly!"
4,"Lunch was delicious, as usual. I had the bruschetta trio for the first time and I couldnt find anything wrong with it, much as I tried to. Not even the onions bothered me. And if you know me, you know how much I hate onions. But their bruschetta was so full of all my favorite flavors I couldnt even complain about the onions. Now thats saying something."
1,"The absolute worse service Ive encountered. My boyfriend, son and I sat at a tepan table, we were ignored for a good 15-20 minutes until my boyfriend had to ask the manager to please have someone get us something to drink. Once we had our drinks, it took another 20 minutes to order our food. By that time, another family sat at our table. My son & boyfriend ordered a meal from the tepan menu, I had sushi. Everyone on that table got their meal and I still didnt get my sushi. I asked the server to please bring it and she brought someone elses order, I had to wait another 20 minutes for my sushi. The family on our table were so upset for us as well.  The food is excellent, the service is so poor I am disappointed. I advise anyone who comes here to sit at the sushi bar and deal with the Chefs, they are great. I talked to the owner and she was just as bad as the servers.  I then gave it another try. I met my girlfriends there. We had dinner, spent over $200. We then moved over to the bar area and were completely forgotten about. We asked the manager/owner to please have someone come take care of us and we were told that they were concerned because we were drinking and had kids with us. One of my girlfriends had her kids but she was not drinking. I was offended that she tried to cover up the poor service with her so-called concern.  Again, food is great service is lousy. I am so disappointed and will not go back. I will look elsewhere for my Caliente Rolls. I hear Blu at the Wigwam is really good and servers are hospitable."
1,"I wouldve gone 2 stars if I were more forgiving. I could reason that it was the end of the day, that a big crowd of wayward children had just come through, or that a hurricane had blown out the back of the restaurant. But then, I tasted it. It looks as if Yogurtini is pretty well-loved around these parts, and Im sorry to report otherwise. Its was like a bomb had gone off. The tables were filthy, the machine handles were all gunked up, there was assorted debris on the floor. The two teenagers working were too busy gossiping about who knows what to do their jobs. When we walked in there were a few customers sampling flavors among the ruins, with no employees in sight. We grabbed some sample cups from the register and dodged napkins and froyo puddles (and other customers) to try some different flavors. The levers are the type that if you pull just a bit too far you make a mess all over your hand, especially when trying to squirt a tiny bit in a sample cup. This mess is then added to the greater mess of everyone else attempting this same operation, and no-one attempting to clean it up. The stuff was real overpowering, to where instead of tasting like what it was supposed to taste like, it was bordering on medicine or like a bad imitation of what it was supposed to be. Like, cheesecake doesnt taste like that, good cheesecake anyway... And neither does cake batter, or banana. Where did the yogurt part go? And how do you screw up cookies and cream, exactly? The two that were the best (and most edible) were the Irish mint and the red velvet, and thats what we mostly ended up with. The decor didnt add to our experience. Everything is a mint green, but it doesnt come off as retro or even minty, but more like dated and hospital-like. Some people really like it but I found it unappetizing. A surly teenager magically appeared as we approached the register, only to disappear again soon after we paid. We sat down at a dirty table and dealt with our choices while the two teens again made an appearance, half-mopping-half-attempting-to-clean while chattering back and forth about their dating woes. We finished our yogurt but both strongly considered abandoning the whole affair. I very well could have walked into Yogurtini at the worst possible time on the worst possible day, with all the factors stacked against them, but I wont be returning to find out if this was the case."
4,"Its a chain, but eating with my fingers, whats not to like. Im a wimp in the spicy department so, I dont often eat buffalo hot wings because everyone Im with orders the ""hot"" ones.  I like the sauce options at Wild Wings and the and the wings are meaty. I had the Parmesan Garlic and the Asian Zing. Its also cool that small portions are available so I was able to order 2 versions. I was able to tolerate the Asian Zing, so maybe Ill try the mild or even medium classic versions next time. My hubby ordered the Jerk Chicken Sandwich and he really liked it. The onion rings were pretty darn good, too.  The only thing negative on this visit was the sucky Berry Lemonade made with Minute Maid Lemonade, I thought for the price it would have been fresh squeezed, but alas I did not read the small type."
4,The first thing that sticks out in my mind was the service.  Our waitress was all smiles and incredibly adorable! Edamame was perfectly steamed Sushi was tasty Salmon Teriyaki was delicious sake and kirin washed it all down prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is calming.
5,"My husband and I chose Binkleys for our 5th anniversary dinner. We dont usually spend that much on a meal, but for a special occasion we decided to splurge, and we are soooo glad we did. We decided to do the 4 course tasting meal, and with the many amuse bouches throughout the meal we left so full, I couldnt even finish my wonderful seared foie gras. The atmosphere was cosy and inviting, the wait staff friendly and helpful. The three hours we spent enjoying our meal was well spent. We would both like to revisit and enjoy another taste adventure with this lovely resturant."
2,"The manager at this location is a pretentious jerk, he is condescending and immature.  I will never return to this place or recommend it.  The food is delicious, the atmosphere is sophisticated but the crowd is lame and the management is even worse. Spend your evening and your money elsewhere."
5,"I came in for a gift for my boyfriends pleasure.  The lady working there answered my questions thoroughly and professionally.  Any shyness or awkwardness I might have felt disappeared.  I was prepared to spend more for a different product but was steered to a better choice by this lady.  Turns out, my boyfriend was very happy with his gift.  This was around Halloween so there were a lot more items than usual like costumes, pasties... fun things.  I can wholeheartedly recommend this Fascinations!"
5,"Food is good to the tummy. To me this is better than in and out burger. Place is spotless,  friendly service, and wide selection."
1,"One star would be giving it a holiday gift! For me Copper Star Coffee Shop has been a place where consistency and pride is taken in their food and presentation. Unfortunately, Circle H BBQ is nothing like the prior statement. My first visit to Circle H BBQ centered on ordering a half slap of ribs. They were extremely over-cooked.  There was more charcoal on the top, back and ends that was just not editable.  Once you scraped away the charcoal, on the tops, ends and the center ribs, there was one that was eatable.  The company offered me a second chance to try their food, by giving me a complementary full slap.  Nothing had improved. They say they smoke the ribs, but there was no odor to that effect. In face the ribs I ordered the second time spend over 20 minutes on the grill after the order was placed. Btw...the waitress at the front counter couldnt even tell be the type of rub on the ribs and the type of cut they were. When I asked if they were smoked (cooked) daily, she said some are if you get here early - others were from the refrigerator from last night. The so called ""dry-rub"" seasoning was tasteless. The BBQ sauce is major strange! The bottom line is the ribs were not worth the cost they were charging. ($14/Half for 6 bones and $26/Whole 12-13 bones both with sides) I have high hopes for the brisket, but it might be a while untill I try that endeavor. Overall if they dont change the way they burn"" the ribs, run, run or drive real fast to another place.  The charcoal is not good for you and there is lots of it! Honey Bears, My Mothers or even driving to Famous Daves is well worth the trip. Sorry to burst your bubble, I too, had high hops for a centrally located rib place.   Im still waiting."
5,Love it and love the GF menu.  Its amazing how many dishes they have
3,"Ok first off, with the demise of Soma and the fact that Green is in Tempe.....this place is a welcome sight, and I know Ill be back. The food is excellent. However I feel that Dr Weil has has has the wool pulled over his eyes by Mr. Fox. Come one ""Anazazi Beans"" and a drink called the ""Medicine Man""? Really- as an American Indian rights advocate youd think wed be past this. Actually, youd think educated white men with lots of money would be past this --but ya know. Just because Anazazi really refers to Ancestral Pueblo people who lived mainly in NM and N. AZ and means ""ancient enemy"" in Navajo so that term isnt used by nearly ANYONE anymore...means that you probaby shouldnt call your dish by that name. Other than that- I give em props for trying. I recently had another experience there where EVERYTHING was going wrong that night, and the staff recovered....kinda. My advice, shape up if ya wanna last."
5,"Green is by far one of my favorite restaurants to eat at.  My husband loves it too and he is a carnivore!  Our favorite things to get are the ""boneless buffalo wings"" and something that another customer shared with me while waiting in line that is not on the menu ""the Wendys pickle sandwich"" It is amazing!  Another special they have from time to time is ""the big WAC"" and I must say it is better than the real thing!!!!!"
3,"Haus Murphys was my first German food experience ever. The cuisine was OK but it isnt something Id shove people down to get to.  I went with a friend who lived in Germany for a bit and he said that Murphys wasnt quite up to par.  We ordered the sausage sampler as an appetizer. The sausages were tasty, but they were a bit cold. For something that is labeled a ""sampler"", I felt disappointed with only two types of sausages served in it. I dont know for sure what types they were, but they didnt taste unique to me, as it seems like you can purchase them in the meat section of any supermarket.  The sausages were served with three types of condiments. A sweet style mustard, a Dijon style mustard, and ketchup blended with curry, which Im told is a recent favorite of the German kids brought over from Turkish immigrants.  For our entrees, we all had some type of schnitzel. That same friend told me to try the Wiener schnitzel as it is the representative item when you think of German cuisine. So all our schnitzels came out and mine was the blandest. My friends schnitzels had different gravies, toppings, and stuff and my poor little Wiener schnitzel was just bland and all alone. You have to get that Wiener schnitzel wet with gravy !  No biggie, Im a foodie so Ill eat it. A schnitzel is basically German country fried pork. Not super exciting. I copied my friend who lived in Germany and substituted potatoes on the side for spatzle, as I wanted this experience to be as authentic as possible. I dont know if its just Haus Murphys, but the spatzle was kind of bland, even with the gravy.  I do however like the word spatzle. If I ever visited Germany, I would only say spatzle, to everyone. I also liked the other thing that was served with the entree. It was kind of like a mashed potato mixed with some creme sauce, onions and some kind of green vegetable or herb (probably spinach).  The beer here was good authentic German beer. I didnt get drunk, but I still dont remember what kind I had, youll have to experiment.  Service was excellent. I read some reviews that said Murphys was slow but everything came out quickly and evenly for us. The waitress was very friendly and they spoke lovely German (not that I speak ANY German, but it sounded sexy). She was very helpful in describing everything, from the food to the beer. I ordered a BAP (big ass pretzel) to go. Philly is known for some pretty good pretzels and this BAP was good. It was expensive, but it came out warm, soft & chewy. The only thing is they went a little heavy on the salt.  To steal and modify a quote from a Seinfeld episode: ""That big ass pretzel made me thirsty""!   Note* They dont actually have it on the menu as a BAP. Would I return to Murphys? Ehhh, yeah to try some of the other things, but I definitely cant see it as a place that I would be a regular at."
5,This is one of the best Asian meals you may ever eat. They are amazingly inexpensive for lunch too. The house fried rice and the wonton soup are perfection. The Lincoln location is prettier but the food is the same.
3,"Is Jimmy single?  Cause if he is, Id like to introduce myself. Nice local Italian spot.   Decent prices. Friendly service.   Antipasta salad was great, lots of goodies for the money.  Meatballs and Italian sausage were okay bu the spicy sauce was great. I will be back to try the pizza, get another salad and ask if Jimmy is around."
5,"I am OBSESSED with Ra.  Thank God that it is a chain restaurant otherwise I dont know how I would get my fix when in different states.  I dont care what everyone says about the best sushi, blah blah blah.  This place is THE best! First of all it has the BEST happy hour!  I was introduced to the restaurants best items during happy hour when it was less expensive to be adventurous.  My absolute favorites are the Sweet Onion Salmon, Salmon Carpaccio and Shishito Peppers.  The Sweet Onion Salmons sauce is to die for, the Salmon Carpaccio is soft and creamy with a nice kick of wasabi and the Shishito Peppers have the most amazing garlic-type sauce!  I usually order the peppers with a side of white rice and drizzle the sauce on it for a more filling meal.   Other favorites are the RAckin shrimp, Uchi No Salad and Vegas Roll--basically any of the happy hour items are great! Oh and I cant forget about the desserts, if you have any room left you have to try the cinnamon tempura ice cream, but share it because it is very filling."
4,"Thai, Vietnamese a nice patio, good happy hour and a swanky inside they have it all. Despite being a nicer place as Asian food goes the prices are quite reasonable and it is really a great value.  The happy hour menu has Asian tappas (apps) for $5 and many $5 cocktails and glasses of wine. WE had the salmon satay which was just grilled cubes of salmon on a stick with sauce and some salad, good but nothing special. The veggie wontons were great in a brown sauce and filled with veggies and again a small salad garnish. My cocktail was great but it was a bit strong. For our mains we had the Salmon with green curry, It came in a HUGE Bowl it was rich and full of great veggies and fresh not overcooked fish. $12.95 We also had the dragon noodles, which was veggies tofu and glass noodles. It was light and fresh. ~10 Over all great quality value and patio I will be back."
5,"Mojos was my favorite till I tried Menchies..much better flavors like Chocolate Covered Banana and even Pumpkin (awesome) for their seasonal!  Lots of flavor, very rich, clean & priced at about what they charge at mojos..maybe a little more but Im not sure!"
3,"Ok... So I am a sucker for a great breakfast joint that isnt some huge national chain.  Maybe its the fact that orange county seriously lacks many good breakfast joint option.  Secondly, the fact that they have dog friendly patio service elevates the place in my book. Our trips to Scottsdale arent complete until we make a stop here for breakfast.  The portions are huge!  The surprising part is that the food is good, which is not usually the case with places with places that do large portions (usually hoping that size covers up the taste). With their Mexican options such as the breakfast burrito or huevos ranchero... They knock the cover off the ball.  The green chil pork in the huevos rancheros is fantastic and keeps me coming back for it."
4,"Ive seen this place come up on Yelp a lot, especially since its near where I work, and finally had a chance to take Jon S. out for a sort of going away dinner the other night. I thought to make reservations, which was a good idea because it was very packed on a Friday night. We started with the taste of thai, which is their version of a pupu platter. My favorites were the thai toast and chicken satay. It was a little weird that the fried items were hot, but the pot stickers and siamese kisses were a little warm, but still good. I had the crispy basil chicken (level 3 hot) and Jon had the shrimp stirfry (level 1 hot). When our dishes were brought out, we both loved the flavors, but agreed we needed some more heat, and our server gladly brought out some chili paste for us which did the job.  Its a very cute restaurant and Ill definitely be back to try some other things on the menu."
4,"Back again.  Still thinking about the flatbread pizza w/ tandoori chicken. I told my friend not to order it as an appetizer b/c I felt it would be too much food intake.  One of the best things Ive eaten in a while.  I cant wait to order that as my MAIN dish next time. Soooooo good. You gotta try it! The chutney and all the flavor combinations were perfect.  It didnt sound so special on the menu, but it is!"
2,Hostess staff were a few unorganized morons-- it appeared as if it was literally their first night on the job. Maybe too many of them? The service was fast but I wouldnt say friendly. She made a few mistakes with our order-- gave my daughter a cheese pizza when we ordered pepperoni..  She put a glass right in front of my 22 mo old who grabbed it right away of course-- few other rookie mistakes like that. Calamari- gross. Lobster/crab tacos with white bland rice-- dont order it. My husband was happy with ribeye and atmosphere is cool and clean.
5,I had a facial with Jennifer and it was fantastic!  She used all proper techniques and overall it was a very relaxing and wonderful experience.  Would definitely recommend this spa for anyone living or vacationing in the area.
4,"When you specialize in something, then you should know it and do it well. This is the Zinburger approach to burgers. Our server, besides being very attentive and friendly, was also extremely knowledgeable about the preparation and ingredients. It showed me that Zinburger really knows their burgers and takes the time to educate their staff. It also served to heighten my expectations...which werent let down. The quality of my burger was very apparent. The bun was fresh, the meat was high grade, and the other ingredients were also well thought out. I love when restaurants are meticulous with their creations. This is a superb burger, expertly prepared from the creation of the patty (not too compressed) to the cooking of it (a perfectly pink in the middle ""medium"" is what I ordered and received). Simply great. The milkshakes are over-the-top rich and delicious--like eating whole pint of Haagen Dazs. We all shared one, and it was still overkill. Great tasting though. The fries were a little ""meh"" to me. Not sure why. They were hot & fresh, but a little bland. I tried the Truffle Fries as well, and they were also a little boring. Maybe they should try a different kind of oil or potato...or both. They were decent fries, just not as ""top notch"" good as the burgers. Lastly, for a ""burger joint,"" the service was excellent...to the point of fine dining type pampering. Very nice. Overall, Im a fan. Im looking forward to returning."
5,"No question -- my FAVORITE burger in the valley! I first got turned on to Lobbys at a Yelp Office Hours -- http://www.yelp.com/biz/september-office-hours-at-lobbys-tempe#hrid:kQOElzgklMRbAyWS8LhVFw - - and by my check-ins, you can see ive frequented there since.  Ive tried a lot of other ""great"" burgers -- 5 Guys, Smashburger, etc - but IMHO, none of them stack up to the food and the experience at Lobbys.  The burgers at Lobbys are so good that I crave them --I want to drive across town or plan out my day so that Im in the area to get one! I just feel that theres more quality ingredients with a Lobbys burger -- the bun, the taste, the way the cheese melts over the whole patty, the special sauce, and the burger itself.  And just as Lynn W says the service is truly superior here and "" He (Lobby) really cares about his business and it shows"".  Ive recommended many friends to check out Lobbys and have brought a few friends here -- everyone has loved it! Especially my Chicago friends that live in the valley.  Lobbys burgers is that raised bar that I measure all other burger joints to."
4,"Mosaic is a gorgeous restaurant in North Scottsdale, near Pinnacle Peak. I imagine that they have magnificent views of the desert and mountains when its still light out. The dining room is pretty small, so Id recommend reservations. If you cant get reservations, Id caution against dining in the lounge. Although they serve the full menu there, the lounge is actually in its own room and usually pretty empty, so it would detract from the whole experience. The service here is pretty close to perfect - these are professionals, the kind of staff thats trained to stop and step aside as you walk past them, even if theyre not in your way at all. The gourmet cuisine here is great - not as inventive as Binkleys, but just as well executed. The menu changes often, so I cant really recommend any particular dishes, other than the amazing Thai shrimp and coconut soup, the one dish thats always on the menu. I would not recommend ordering their foie gras, if its on the menu. It was the only dish that really missed the mark. Ive only had foie gras one other time before, at Picasso in Vegas, so I dont have that much of a basis of comparison, but the foie gras at Mosaic was way inferior to Picassos phenomenal foie gras (my understanding is that the best foie gras should be firm, smooth, a little buttery - theres here was watery and blubbery). However, that was the only ""miss"" of the night, out of our many courses. For a special occasion or a splurge night out, you wont be disappointed by Mosaics beautiful restaurant and surroundings, excellent staff, and wonderful food."
5,"This cafe provided me with my first Ethiopian cuisine experience. It was delicious and I am eager to go back. The most impressive thing to me was their selection of vegetarian dishes. They had as many options as those with meat which I really appreciate (doesnt happen very often.) The service was great. You can tell this is a family run restaurant that cares about their patrons. The food is very reasonably priced which make it easy to try a variety of dishes.  We started with the shorba which is a lentil based soup. This was probably my favorite part of the meal, it was absolutely delicious---satisfying and hearty. We also had the vegetable combination which had 5 different dishes served on the injera, a crepe-like bread you eat the main dishes with. This is a fun way to eat (with your hands) and opened up a new world of foods for us! Cant wait to go back and devour a bowl of shorba."
4,"I cant stand 50s retro but this place is the cuteness. Well...I havent technically been inside. Now, I knew this was a hipster hangout, but I wasnt expecting the cute girl in the apron or the boy with tattoos to actually be working on the other side of that window. They didnt seem to mind that I was slightly drenched in sweat having walked there under the sun of a blazing March afternoon. They were quite nice and gave my sister and I a bowl of water for our doggies. Tattoo boy said he would even make us more fries if we wanted. The fries ($2) were not the best  and neither was my grilled cheese ($4) with tomato (yum!) and pickles (?). However, the food had a nice home-made quality to it and was all ready in about a minute. Peeps are right about the high-quality ingredients and the food is inexpensive. Holler. P.S. Dont forget the Ca$hM0nayyy or to borrow from a sibling!"
4,"You my new found friend are uber popular! And, I can see why. Your restaurant is ridiculously friendly to families, girls day out and boys at the bar. I rolled in for a late day brunch with a girlfriend and was immediately seated and got to ordering right away. The menu is pretty straight forward and not real complicated.  I was in the mood for booze, really when am I not in the mood for booze, and Francis, you saint you, you delivered this fantastic gin cooler. It was excellent and I made me think I should have a pool party and serve them to all my friends, or just sit at your bar and order another! With my booze, I needed some food and I went with the eggs benedict. Hollandaise sauce is the true test of a good eggs benny. Your hollandaise is really good. Fabulous in fact. The eggs were nicely poached and I have no idea what you do with the english muffins but there was something spectular about them....All around tasty.  All and all, I can definitely see myself coming back the only draw back is the parking....more parking please!"
5,"This was such a good experience I was up all night with a extremely severe painful tooth ache I dont have health insurance so I didnt think I could afford a dentist Friends and Family told me to look up a dental school and thats how I found A.T. Still I called and they said they accept five Emergency patients a day at 1:pm It was 11am but I didnt care I drove straight there and I was the first patient seen at 1p.m. it cost $15 to be seen, $15 for the X-Rays, and turns out my wisdom tooth was infected and had a cavity so they sent me up to oral surgery, it cost me $85 to get the tooth extracted i was nervous and they talked me through it and calmed my fears It didnt hurt at all, I was numbed up and the student did a good job they gave me a three prescriptions to take with me and I have to return next week for follow - up the follow up appointment is FREE! totally recommend this place to any and everyone!"
3,I personally love the other crackers so much more. I think its the better customer service Im never really impressed with the services here. Its either okay or a little below expectation something always happens when I come here. Something is forgotten or the wait is ridiculous just for the check to be picked up to be paid for or something. I can never tell you because it always changes.  Food wise...good. this last visit the French toast was NOT as amazing as it usually is. So kind of bummed about that. And my skillet I must have ordered the wrong thing because I usually just get the skillet with carnitas eggs and potatoes this time their was chorizo in it so it made my potatoes soggy:(  those things are another reason for dropped stars and also because I dont care for Chorizo and all its oils. For food and service to be off is unusual. But it happened so i always remember if you want the best you have to go to the best and this place is not it. Go to the one in mesa behind Home depot and beside Holiday Inn!
4,"Our dinner club ended up at Maizies this month after the other pick was closed.... we lucked out! We were unknowingly there on $3 burger Monday, so pretty much everyone ordered the burger. They had told us the wait would be short, 15-20 minutes. It ended up being about 45 min, which was a little frustrating. But our waiter was awsome and fast and we received our food very quickly. I think us ravenous girls had a turnaround of about 30 minutes once seated.  First I have to give homage to their fries... Both the regular and sweet potato are excellent. Well seasoned, with potato skins, and a nice balance of crispy and soft. Their chipotle dipping sauce is reminiscent of the yummy sauce at Delux. I got a basic burger with cheddar cheese - it was cooked perfectly to order and tasted great. Total bill: $5.00 ($3 burger + $1 cheese +$1 fries= amazing deal!) My friends salad was huge and delicious looking with all kinds of good stuff on it. I want to go back and try a salad, and maybe pizza and sangria night (Tues & Wed) or, ooh, one of their stuffed burgers. I think Ill be back a few times..."
4,"Totts is this amazing little neighborhood Asian restaurant that has quickly become a favorite of mine! The simple yet effective decor is vibrant without being tacky.  The service is very friendly and helpful.  They are always smiling and it actually seems sincere! This is one of those places where you order your food from a cashier and they give you a number and you choose your seat from one of the 16 or so tables.  There is a nice little patio as well.  There are a couple of tasks you must do before they bring out your order.  1. Fill your cup with your beverege of choice (Soft drinks and Tea only- no alcohol, hence only 4 stars).  Do get a beverege as the food can be very hot if you like that way-AND I DO!  And because I am a fool thinking it will never be hot enough, I grab a jar of the hot mustard and one of the Hot Chili paste to bring to my table.  You can, of course, choose chopsticks or a fork.  I usually start with the good intentions and select the chopsticks.  I pretend I know exactly what I am doing.  But these never work as I cannot get enough food into my mouth quick enough so I end up with at least 1 fork. I am impressed how quickly they bring your order to your table.  I barely have time to do all of the above and get back to my table and they are bringing out a gorgeous plate of steaming Hot Korean with black bean sauce and tofu, or the yellow curry ""panang"" also with tofu.  You can aslo get chicken, beef or fish.  The meats are hand trimmed and do not have that grisle part that is such a turn off at other places.  The vegetable are as bright and fresh as the smiles on the employees faces. I must also confess my longing for PF Changs or Pei wei has certainly  diminished after discovering Totts. Totts even has excellent Won Ton soup. Now if they could only get a beer and wine license."
5,"Therere times when you eat something and you want more. Then there are times when you eat something and you instantly know you will never have anything quite like it. For me, I experienced both of those at Pizzeria Bianco. My buddy and I drove almost 500 miles from Santa Barbara for a Giants-Diamondbacks game and thought wed try this place I had heard about. We arrived fairly late so there was about a one hour wait but man, was it worth it. We ordered a Biancoverde and a Wiseguy. I was a bit skeptical at first because they each didnt have tomato sauce like I was used to, but I realized I dont care much for tomato sauce in the first place and Im always up for trying new things. BEST DECISION OF THE DAY. The Biancoverde was my favorite. It was so simple (3 cheeses, arugula, and olive oil) yet so amazing. It has left me wanting more to this day. The staff was nice and friendly, not to mention a few cuties. I will definitely drive 500 miles for it again. In fact, Ill be making my way to Phoenix in a few weeks, JUST for the pizza!"
3,"As far as basic burgers go this is an OK option. The flavor is ok and basic toppings give everyone enough choice. Better than McDonalds yeah and similar to In-n-Out but nothing really special. Price is not cheap for a burger so I would expect a little more, but not more fries because they give you a bucket full and more."
3,"I hate walking in here because it always stinks.  They really need to ventilate this place.  My daughter loves it, always had a great time, whether she is skating or attending Club 54.  Great place for birthday parties, she loved her party.  She also got a butt-load of tokens with the party package."
5,Bomb ..................................................................................................................... Heated toilet seats
4,"Went there for Dinner on a Friday night and I have to say Im impressed by the quality of the food and the reasonable prices.  Theres a great deal of variety and some creative New Mexican dishes.  Id go so far as to say this is the best New Mexican restaurant in the East Valley!  Its not super spicy like Los Dos but theres a lot more flavor and youll still feel the burn. Pros:  The Food and Service Cons:  Ambiance & decor could use a little jazzing up, location is not ideal"
4,"This review is for the Chandler location. The food here is pretty good. We came here twice during my last visit to AZ. We tried the nachos, the 7 layer dip, the guac and chips. The nachos were really good (make sure to add steak or chicken, both are great), and they give you a lotta guac too. The 7 layer dip was kinda dull, like they scooped out the filling of a microwaved bean and cheese burrito. Either way, all their food is pretty cheap, and during happy hour, drinks are a great deal. Also, I like the way the place is set up; most of it is outdoors/patio, so it makes for a different experience. Theres also a lot of games and things to do. We saw a group of guys playing beer pong on one of the tables, and by the womens restroom theres a lobster catching game. Wed spent like 12 bucks on that game and didnt win ourselves a lobster but we got close one time, and it was pretty damn fun."
5,"This place is absolutely amazing.  If you are looking for a quick sweet treat this is the place to go.  It a little hole-in-the-wall looking place, but once you take a bite into one of their homemade ice cream sandwiches, your mind will change.  I usually go for the mint ice cream with chocolate chip cookie, but when its fall, I cant pass up the pumpkin ice cream with snicker doodle cookie. Ive never found anything like it since."
5,"i cant review restaurants in phx and leave out LGO. breakfast, coffee ambiance, service, pizza - 5 stars. happy hour 3 stars. Not very many places beat this place out for saturday or sunday morning coffee and or breakfast after a nice wrkout, run, hike or... anything else at home in bed with your better half. must see for my visitors"
2,"So I am an occasional shopper here at this market.. for a few reasons: we love their in-house made corn tortillas; they have a good selection of mexican treats (Bimbo breads and coconut bars) and if Im buying conventional produce, their prices cant be beat.  Also, their pan Bolillo is really good and cheap and their cakes (3 Leches) are pretty damn good. OK, so here is where the minus comes in.. the BIG minus. My husband and I used to go occasionally for breakfast (Id usually order simple, straightforward things like carne asada tacos.. dont get much simpler than meat in a corn tortilla).. well, the last time we did this, I found my meat... ready?... wait for it... to be the color blue and purple.  I had brown meat, but I had pieces of it that were blue and purple... no effin joke.  I thought it was a trick of the eye, but I closely examined it and ... shonuff, that shit was blue and purple.  I immediately threw away my dish and never have I since ordered meat from their kitchen side. That being said, Ive also become more cautious in buying meats here... not to sound like a snob, but you bet Im not buying my next cut of beef here!  Im cool with their breads and their cakes and tortillas and such, but if it comes to meat, Im out the door. I much prefer Pros Ranch Market - the REAL Ranch Market."
4,"This was my first trip to Culvers and it came highly recommended. At my friends suggestion, I tried the butter burger deluxe, fried cheese curd and the.....I forgot what it was called, but the frozen custard - basically the equivalent of a DQ Blizzard. The burger patties were paper thin (thus the reason I ordered the double), the lettuce was crisp, tomatoes fresh, bun soft and buttery. I thoroughly enjoyed my burger. Very flavorful! I had never had fried cheese curd and had no idea what to expect. The closest thing I can think to compare these to would be mozzarella sticks. They are about the size of a grape, and full of salty cheesy goodness. The custard was delicious! I had the vanilla with butterscotch and oreos (I ordered butterscotch and brownie pieces, but there was a mixup, but I had no complaints). I really loved everything I had. The menu is big and I cant wait to go next time so I can try something new.  The thing I didnt like was the bible verses all over the walls. Seriously?? Its not that I am anti-religion or anything. I am Catholic, went to Brophy and go to church twice a year. I dont need it thrown in my face while trying to eat with my friends. take a tip from In and Out. Put them on the under side of your cups. Work on your subtlety Culvers."
4,"Fantabulous! Thats the best way I can describe the food here. I really wanted to get a photo of my dish, because it was a work of art, despite just being pasta et al piled onto a plate. Unfortunately, between my hunger and the amazing aroma wafting off the plate, the camera never made it out. This dish, by the way, was the strozzapreti. I could go on about how wonderful it was, but Ill spare the reader. Oh, there were also the Zucca chips. I nearly bit the waiters hand off when he tried to remove the scraps. In truth, I would love to give this place 5 stars. The food, without a doubt, warrants that rating. However, the place was pretentious to the point that it was palpable. The acoustics of the restaurant made for a very loud experience. Oh and the server was actually a bit too attentive. She was great, very nice, on top of everything... but just a little too much. Overall Id like to go again and try out some more of what they have to offer! (And of course, have more zucca chips...)"
4,"First read about this in the recent 2009 Best of Phoenix and wow, what a great choice! The place is cozy and friendly (laidback atmosphere) with food that is a wonderful culinary experience. I enjoyed the roasted garlic in olive oil with the toasted baguette slices from the start menu, though the nosh plate might need some work (more types of cured meats, and maybe some of those tiny dill pickles).  From the starter plates we had the crostini duo and the roasted grapes and brie on the multi-grain bread slices was popular with all - the one with the cucumber slices on them, a distant and less exciting second. The other starter - dates stuffed with homemade Chorizo and grueyer cheese, yum! The come on a bed of greens with some sort of vinegar dressing, which was a nice compliment. For Sharing Section of the menu - the citrus brined fried chicken and cheddar cheese waffles, loved by all! I recommend ordering it early since we asked for it about 7 pm and it was the last one left. Even the braised greens were good. I was not so impressed with the halibut filet plate  - nicely seasoned but frankly, a bit dry. Other thoughts - they really like cucumber here - they put it in the water (makes it quite refreshing), garnished my gin and tonic with it (homemade tonic, nice but not really wowed by it), and had it on the previously mentioned crostini duo plate - just seemed like a lot of cucumer. As for the service, it was good throughout the meal. The waiter kept things well paced and was a good source of information when asked, without being overly obtrusive. If you havent gone, worth checking out and if you have gone worth going back again. :-)"
2,I love the cornbread and butter but the rest can do without. The plates are so huge and super sloppy. The lettuce wraps are no good!  I did like our waitress but the bar tender with blonde hair was supper bitchy to the other staff it was annoying.
5,"my son loves the splash pad! His dad or uncles stay with him at the playground while I can run in the store or two that I need to! There are quite a few empty retail spots, hopefully they can get some new stores in there as well,"
2,"I am only reviewing it with 2 stars because my waiter was too busy and I dont think that was his fault.  We showed up and was able to sit right down which is great because when we left there was tons of people waiting.  We had a coupon for joining their mailing list that gave us a free meal with the purchase of another...which is awesome because who eats alone?  They also recently remodeled the interior and it looks pretty good.  My wife ordered the usual broccoli quiche and it was only a little warm.  I usually order the bacon and eggs which is awesome but today I ordered the Florentine Benedict and it was very good.  The food is always great here....when its warm and the service is usually awesome except today, but I wont blame Kevin since he was obviously over-sat.  I hope they get their stuff together because I WILL go back and I know that I WILL be able to write a better review afterward since I have been here 100 times and this was the only poor experience Ive ever had."
4,"freaking huge portions. the sandwiches are super yummy. the french toast, covered in bananas, and that crumbly sugary delicouisness is to die for...and you might unless you jog 10 miles afterwards. but the real treat is the desert counter...oh my god, even to just look at it is an honor. good bang for the buck."
5,"Came here on a Friday night after a bike ride. As an Irish bar, there is a lot of whiskey on the wall, but they can make whatever you need. The food was a hell of a lot better than I thought it was going to be.  On the encouragement of the bouncer, I ordered the wings which were meaty but Ive had better. What I should have gotten was the shepards pie. 2 of my friends got it, and it was VERY good. Im going to go back, just get it on my own.  Lastly, this place dishes out cheap, strong drinks. Good place to get sauced before hitting a club."
5,"went down to Scottsdale for Spring Training (Go Giants!) and we decided we wanted to have a nice, sit down meal instead of bar food or ballpark food every day/night.  Eddies House fit the bill perfectly. Food - excellent.  Tuna Tartar ""nachos"" were great.  I had the scallops and they were perfectly cooked.  Also had a size of Fiddlers Ferns which Ive only tried once before.  they were excellent.  Berry Cobbler for dessert also excellent.   Service - excellent.  very nice waiter who was very attentive. Location - close to downtown but not on the immediate Scottsdale Road path.   Atmosphere - also excellent Prices - being from San Francisco, the prices were unbelievably reasonable."
4,Julio Gs lunch menu offers some very delightful dishes.  I recommend the beef flautas special with rice and beans. The wait staff was very nice and efficient.  Good group restaurant spot!
4,"So after doing an internship in Downtown Phoenix, I was introduced to Carolinas. I was a little apprehensive at first, but I had heard many rants and raves about this hole and had to try for myself. After my first bite of Carolinas burrito, I was in love. It was awesome, and I continued to sample many of the items on Carolinas menu for the remainder of my internship, never once disappointed. I even brought home some of their famed tortillas - just those warmed with a little butter - simply melts in your mouth goodness. Awesome and cheap too!"
5,"I visited this place in January while I was in Phoenix and I miss the food! My vegan friend suggested this place to me and my other friend (we were skeptical that vegan food could taste good)...she proved us wrong! The food here was delicious, Id eat here regularly if I lived in Phoenix! When we arrived, we were worried about the hours since we got there pretty close to closing time, but they were cool! We shared the samosas and buffalo wings for appetizers. I ordered the Thai Peanut bowl with mock chicken and noodles for my entree. I felt like everything was flavored well and while I enjoy meat normally, this opened my mind to trying other vegetarian places in the future. I liked the ambiance here, great place to grab a bite with friends and chill. It was the perfect place to stop by after a busy weekend! Ill be back next time Im in the area."
4,"went for an early dinner with my honey on saturday.  we normally dont order apps but we we didnt have lunch so we needed something to get us through. we went with the hummus and pita bread and it was so fresh and yummy! server said that its homemade in house. For my entree I ordered the salmon with mixed veggies and the hubster ordered the crispy chicken and subbed the creamed corn with mashed potatoes, he loved his side of asparagus... smokey flavor.  our server did provide us a lit sample of the creamed corn because he raved how delicious it is. yes the creamed corn was very rich and in my opinion not worth the calories unless youve been good all day.  we both ordered red cabs and we skipped dessert since we were nice and full. enjoyed our meals and the friendly service."
5,"This place pushes out some delicious food, Red chile burro with rice and beans is better than any Ive had, and their Nachos are soooo freaking cheesey and good youll want to order both for one sitting. Unfortunately only outside seating but cool art work on the building to enjoy while eating and dont be discouraged by there greedy practice of charging for extra hot sauce. But of all things to remember make sure you bring cash the place cant afford a card processing machine which is a good thing other wise Id be there too often and a fat face looks weird on me"
5,"I honestly wish I could give this place 0 stars just to keep people out of here- thats how much of a gem my bf and I think this place is. The not only have a more spacious theater, a bar, food beyond the typical nachos and sour patch kids (crappy, but its there and basically just a bonus in my opinion) but they have 3 flavors of popcorn...3! Holy bajesus- we go for the Carmel popcorn alone. I dont even think we have had the regular or the cheese ever, maybe once. We go out of our way to go there just for that. This place is never that busy which I dont understand. Oh, and another plus, its not the Tweens hangout on Friday nights. I will admit, we buy the living social or grouping every time we go there ($15 for 2 tix and 1 popcorn), but they already have our business. You idiots who review a place after going to a highly publicized premier like the Hunger Games that you bought with a Groupon are just that...IDIOTS. No one wants to listen to your nitpicking, go to a useless site like Yahoo Local that no one reads so you dont have to make society dumber for listening to your complaining."
5,"I love Sapporo.  They have reasonable prices, a big menu, great music always playing, entertainment (people watching), etc... Their sushi is very good.  They have fun drinks.   If you make a reservation for dinner you usually dont have to wait. P.S.  They have amazing deals for happy hour, but get there early cause it gets packed!!"
5,Wonderful Vietnamese sandwich shoppe. Their baguettes are great hot out of the oven with butter or in one of their many sandwich choices. They have a modest selection of baked goods along with some of the best egg rolls around. Bring cash or your ATM card as no credit cards are accepted but they have an ATM on premises.
5,I love this location! The food is always great and the service is good. Wi-fi is a plus especially since I am going to school. I come here almost everyday. I recommend this location to everyone.
2,"I guess you really cant put lipstick on a pig. I will say this, its nice inside all new building and equipment, but its very much a westside gym. Many Raider hats and 0.0 eye candy. I would rather go to Moon Valley all the same new stuff but much better loking people. I will say this, its good to see people in a gym that need to be there, and it also seems very gay friendly."
4,"Im a bit of a sandwich addict. This place has the BEST tuna in town, hands down! Cheaper than Jimmy Johns, a bit more than Subway - but the fresh, locally sourced ingredients make up for it. It gets a little packed at lunch hour, so I recommend calling or faxing your order in first.  Try the #4 or #10! The potato salad is also amazing. I have not had a chance to make it in for breakfast, but I want to. A few times, I ended up going down the street to the second location because they ran out of bread (they are that good). The other location is a lot less busy and you might get hit on by one of the dudes there, but this one has Renee behind the register and she rocks (and also owns)."
5,"While I love that it is Native American owned and operated, the best thing about this restaurant is the food - as it should be.  I dont go out to eat to be entertained or charmed - just fed better than I could be at home and that is exactly what this place does.   The food is amazing. The fry bread isnt greasy and I dont know how they do that.  The meals are flavorful, filling, and reasonably priced.  The only thing I would do is add some tomatoes to the tacos but that is a minor quibble.   If you want to go out for a delicious meal in a casual place and not pay a lot for it, GO NOW to the Fry Bread House."
3,"We stopped by and rode the train, which was a good history tour. We discovered the history of gold mining in the area and some of the local lore regarding the Superstition Mountains and the Lost Dutchman Gold Mine.  I would like to come back and spend more time exploring the restored ghost town.  The train ride was a bit expensive for what it was although I enjoyed the Hurry-Up Henry the conductor."
1,"My wife and I were looking for a particular type of rose for our garden. We called this location and asked if they had it in stock and what the price was. They said they did and quoted us a price of $24.99 for a gallon sized plant. Good to go. We drive there and find the rose bush but it is listed as $44.99. So we go to the front and say that  we had called and driven 30 minutes to get this rose and we were told ""Oops...sometimes the  prices on my list up front right"". No sh!t Sherlock. So...will you honor the price quoted? NO.  So we drove down the street to A And P Nursery on Baseline west of Lindsay and got the same size plant that they were selling for $44.99 for $16.99.  Dont waste your time with these rip-off artists."
1,"Its a supermarket.  I just go in buy what I need and get out.  Its convenient that theres a wells fargo in there, but theres one across the street as well.   To the negative experience..... My sister was speaking to my niece, but not in english.  Some caucasian lady walks by and rudely says, ""Cant you speak english?""  WTF?!?  Is this taking SB 1070 in your own hands?  Its like youre trying to make every race hate you even more.  I will run into this arrogance wherever I go. Im not done yet.  Keep on reading.... My niece had a dollar in her hand and was pointing at the lottery scratcher machine.  We know you have to be of a certain age to play it.  One of the employees there rushes over and in a loud voice tells me niece she cant play it.  Calm down.  Kids are just innocent and dont need this extra verbal abuse in their lives.  Dont you have something better to do like restock the shelves?  Swear... Racial profiling."
5,Best pasta I have ever had. Dont go there if youre looking for a two-pound chicken parm or endless breadticks.
3,If only they have more fresh produce Id stop by a lot more often!
3,"Its kinda comfy setting....For the Non-(official), Yelp event, they had penne pasta...but Sonomas specialty is rotisserie chicken......Nice but I sure would have liked to taste what the place raves about---Chicken!  Oh well, the pasta was ok for what it was.  What I truly enjoyed about Sonoma was the layout.  You can easily entertain a fairly large crowd and not be on top of each other.  I need to come back and try their chicken then re-write this review. The parking upstairs for the event was nice also, but later on at night, it seems a bit spooky to be walking up in the parking area alone and in the middle of city center where there are some pretty curious characters about~~~I would prefer coming with more than one person if parking at night in the upper garage (personal preference). The Yelp folks!---Way too cool!  I am so glad to have discovered Yelp!  Best thing Ive done in ages.---Cheers Yelpers!"
4,"i used to come here with my roommate to grab an iced chai and do the crossword puzzle on our lazy, halcyon undergraduate afternoons, or come in for a warm breakfast and a cup of coffee, hungover after an amazing houseshow the night before back in the neighborhood.  this is that kind of place. great, relaxing place to do homework or study.  depending on the day and the time, youll find professors, honors college kids, hipster bike folk - the whole gamut of the non-party-bro asu population. food is good, but a little overpriced, i think.  drinks, like any independent coffeeshop, depend on the barista, but ive never had a really bad drink experience here.  i especially like the dirty chai."
5,"Im pretty sure that Palees Crown is the best Thai place I have ever been to. The service is always great, and the Owner comes out to talk to us whenever we are there. The food is so amazing, I have never tried something that I disliked at all. I especially love the Pad Thai and the Currys. I am always full and completely satisfied by the time I leave. I also recommend trying the Thai Iced Tea to drink if you are like me and enjoy weird authentic drinks, and for dessert be sure to get the coconut ice cream. Dont make excuses about trying to spend less money or that you are being careful about what youre eating, just try it. The prices are good and if youre not sure what to try, stick with a curry but remember that Asian spices are very distinct, and very spicy."
4,"We tried Mr Chaos Asian Bistro last night. Its a small place and they do a lot of take-out orders. The quirky interior works fine for me. My wife thought the single gourami looked kind of sad in the small, flat tank on the wall. They have a bar and a decent selection of wine for a small restaurant. I tried one of the specials, the Hunan Smoked Pork. It was basically kind of like bacon stir-fried with fresh vegetables with a spicy Hunan black bean sauce. I love bacon and I really liked this dish. My wife had prawns w/vegetables, we liked the freshness of the vegetables and generous amount of prawns but overall the dish was slightly bland. She liked it but thought that it would have been better with the lobster sauce. We were mixed on the iced tea, my wife felt it was too strong but I thought it was fine.  Overall, Mr Chaos is a fine choice in Ahwatukee for Americanized Chinese food. It is a bit pricier than our usual stop, Panda Garden, but a nice alternative."
1,"Great food can be found anywhere. Great service is one in a million these days. This place gets an A+ in the most awful service I have ever received and if you have/had a Groupon for this place like I did, dont even bother going. Youll be treated worse than a bothersome fly on a hot and humid day. Its simple. Businesses put  their name out by working with daily coupon sites like Groupon, LivingSocial, etc., to garner new and potential repeat customers. Instead, after going there with my handy coupon, I cant help but drive by this place on the way home and think nothing but the horrible experience I received.  I went with my boyfriend and bought the Groupon because I was impressed due to online reviews and decided to splurge on a good ole prime rib. We sit down, am impressed with the old school decor, and then the server from Azkaban appears. We tell her that wed like to order off the special evening menu where its a little cheaper and tell her joyfully that we found this place through Groupon and that its our first time. Wrong thing to do. I dont know if its because past Groupon-ers dont tip well or something, but I could swear her smile immediately turned 180 degrees in an instant.  It took our food (the chicken and prime rib) almost 33 minutes to come out. All we did was nom ... and nom ... and nom on the watery coleslaw and gritty liver (which isnt to blame since I was never a liver fan). Not once did our server come by our table. We watched her run into the kitchen and either not come back out for a while or attend to other tables. It was another server that came out and gave us our food so we let our frustration go since it wasnt her fault and theres no use in calling her out for nothing. We asked if she knew where our server was, and she said she would look for her. 10 minutes later, nothing, yet it was the new server who kept coming back, asking if everything was alright like a normal server should.  Then it was time for the check and we just wanted to get out of there since we were basically ignored. 17 minutes pass, no check came even though our  table had been cleared. Our server was still MIA so we asked a random server to give us our check. He said he would tell our server to bring it back and we told him straight up that we didnt even want to see her face so another random server brought it back. We had a table of 4 sitting next to us who even leaned over and asked us why we were being so calm when our non-existent server was treating us like crap. We didnt even want to bother waiting another 20 minutes just to talk to a manager since apparently the only way the servers here communicate is by playing Telephone so we just left after paying. The table beside us told us that they were going to complain for us since we wanted to leave, but whether they did or not I didnt even care at that point.  To be honest, I cant even remember what the food tasted like, which isnt quite fair in a review. I went here a couple of months ago, but I have never had an experience where service overrode the taste of food. Im pretty sure prisoners in a cafeteria get more attention than I did. Maybe it wasnt even the Groupon. Who knows. All I know is that we ran out of there like Usain Bolt and tell anyone who asks about our worst dining experience that this is the place to experience it."
5,"I actually visited here about 5 months ago, but I liked it so much I figured I should give it a few good words!  I was at the mall looking for something healthier than a pizza or burger and decided upon this place. It is part of their little slogan after all! I was not disappointed. I chose the beef kabob with a side of fries and pita bread with a cup of hummus. Everything was positively fresh and absolutely delicious. And the portions were big, too. I didnt think I would be filled up after the meal, but I was stuffed! The staff was very friendly and cooked everything in a timely manner. I was surprised they werent getting nearly as much business as the other joints around the food court. They dont know what theyre missing!"
5,"If I could only eat at one place for the rest of my life, it would have to be at FnB. This is ultimate comfort food for me - with the bulk of the menu highlighting local in-season organic vegetables from McClendon and other local farms. Charleen prepares dishes that pay the ultimate homage to the vegetable and the farmer with perfect seasoning, contrast, balance and temperatures.  Beyond vegetables, the housemade burrata was light as a cloud and shrimp grilled to perfection on the mesquite. Dishes at FnB are simple but often the simplest dishes are the hardest to get right as there is nothing to hide behind - ingredients have to be fresh and of the highest quality and execution must be perfect. Charleen and her crew strike it out of the park almost every time. Service is professional, attentive and friendly. Pavle and his team make you feel right at home, which is the other reason why I would happily eat here everyday."
5,"Great time, great location, ability to park in garage behind it. Beautiful decor, candles, white furnishings, trimmed in wood. Excellent vodka choices that will have you dancing on that raised table all nite which gives you a cool panoramic view of the place. See if you can spot the dj booth! Hes cool, friendly door staff. The bartenders kind of ignore you and theres a brunette girl bartender-stay away from her. Downer attitude, and she will charge you for 2 drinks even though they have a 2 for 1 special. But its a cool club and its 99% certain youll have great time."
4,"Step back into the 1990s and enjoy a workout! Nice clean facility. Equipment sort of jammed in at odd angles (in the large weight/cardio room) but its good stuff. Not sure the purpose of two weight rooms. I think the club is more tennis based yet they have do have group exercise classes, racquetball courts and a pool.  I think the spinning room may have been a childrens nursery at one time based on the wall graphics, the black light effect is unique. If this were my club Id place the emphasis on spinning classes and convert the smaller weight room into a spinning studio.  Dropped a star because the womens locker room doesnt have a sauna.  Very friendly employees! I am so glad to be greeted with a smile when walking in the door. Everyone on the staff is friendly. Quaint club. . . in a good way."
5,"...NOW WERE TALKIN! Killer Mexican Food! The chips n salsa kicks ass! You get a red, blue & regular tortilla chips with reg, spicy salsa & bean dip! Hellava start! A kick-butt margarita! Had Chicken Fajitas!...THE BEST! Cannot wait to return! Great ambiance."
4,"So I came here in search for Phoenixs best Macaroni and Cheese. Yep, thats right, me and the inner kid in me are in search of the best Macaroni and Cheese.  So, ordering was simple! So, how was it? Pretty good! It was more cheddary than, say, Becketts Table (which got me started on this dance). The atmosphere was pretty cool there. However our wonderfully bubbly waitress probably came over way too much. Also, nobody coming over to refill our drinks (iced tea) could figure out that we had tea and not water. Oh well. On a separate note, Ive gone by this place around 2AM it looks like a madhouse. Could be a rather interesting time around 2AM!"
3,"I live in downtown Phoenix; Boyfriend lives in Tempe. After two years of getting our date on at places like Postinos, St. Francis, the Rokerij, Dicks Hideaway, and Padres, we decided we needed a Tempe date place. Friday night we decided to check out La Bocca. In short. its okay. Nice environment, good service, pretty good pizza, and great ice cream flight for dessert. But this is tempered with over priced wine (almost $20 for two glasses of HOUSE wine?), small pieces of bruschetta (tasty - scratch that - REALLY tasty, but the slices are teeny tiny), and its on Mill, so most of the other patrons are frat guys trying to impress sorority sisters, and if youre lucky, youll get to see a couple of Greeks making out. Yum? There was a table of older people tucked into a corner who didnt seem to mind the age gap, but in my late-20s, I was not very much amused. The good service, cool atmosphere, tasty bruschetta choices, and creative, thin crust pizza get this place three stars. The over priced wine and bruschetta (seriously, we usually get bruschetta at Postinos for the same price for 4 people, and then I am too full to order dinner, but at La Bocca I was ready for round two after my half of the plate), and the fact that its on Mill keeps it from 5 stars. We both really wanted to like this place, but I think next time we want to get dressed up and go out on the East side, well try somewhere else. In the meantime, well stick to downtown."
4,"This place is busy, had live music in the bar, and the servers were trying to squeeze by.  The seafood is flown in DAILY and I think our bill helped fund a grouper or twos first class seat.  I ordered the grouper with crab on top (as an extra- you can ask for it this way).  Ordered the lobster mashed again, and green beans (if it aint broke- dont order something else.).  Had a great night!"
4,"Weve eaten at Taneko twice now, and while we like it, its awful expensive for what you get, and I prefer a more authentic Japanese environment. Taneko starts off wanting to be a Japanese-style pub restaurant, but ends up throwing way too much Scottsdale into it creating a rather pretentious yet still yummy restaurant. The food is excellent - I enjoy the pork meal that has the stupidly spicy mustard sauce.  My kid likes the fried rice, though it is a little too much on the ginger side.  Theres a gimmicky hot-rock appetizer where you cook pieces of steak on a super hot rock.  Its way too expensive for what little meat you get, but its an awful lot of fun. The service is excellent as well, though maybe a little too servile for my tastes.  The wait staff go WAY out of their way to make you comfortable and quickly take care of any needs.  I just dont care for all of the introductions - Im not going to remember the names of the 4 or 5 people bringing me stuff.  Still, I think thats the Scottsdale influence.  Not bad, but not really my thing. Overall, Ive enjoyed both of the meals that I ate at Taneko, but with better places to eat real Japanese food like Yasu, Sea Saw, Hiros and even Sakana, Im probably not going back real soon."
5,"I have taken acting classes from Verve Studios on and off for four years, and have recently returned for another work out! Amanda is a true professional,  a working Actor herself,and gets the actor to be real, not ""act"".  Do not miss this opportunity to learn and grow, AND have fun. Lawannah Curry Phoenix Az"
5,"They finally just opened a Ritas location in Surprise!! I think it just opened yesterday or today, but its just as good as the one on Union Hills and 83rd Avenue.  I told my co-workers about it and we basically have been driving by during our lunch break just waiting for it to open over the past few months. Its hard to explain the texture of the ice. Its thicker than the ice in a frozen margarita, yet its not crunchy or unrefined like an Icee drink. Sonic has similar ice, but I feel like its just not as good as Ritas. I guess thats why its Italian ice. Its in its own category! There are 3 main types: Gelatis (custard-ice-custard), Blendinis (custard-ice-custard with mix ins like Oreos, M&Ms, etc), and Mistos (ice-custard drink). You can also get just regular custard alone or flavored ice alone. One of their most famous ice flavors is Swedish Fish. Theres also a sugar substitute version of their ice and todays sugar free ice flavor was Pineapple. I tried a Red Velvet Cake Gelati today with vanilla custard and it was nothing less than amazing! The menu is a little confusing since there are so many choices. There are mainly only 2 types of custards though, vanilla and chocolate, that can be mixed with the 12 flavors of ice that consistently change.  Before, I was solely a fan of ice cream and yogurt. Now, I am grateful that my sister-in-law dragged me here, because there is nothing quite like it yet! Now I will always compare Italian ices to this place."
4,"We had a very difficult time finding trail 201 which was noted as one of the more strenuous hikes. We took trail 100 and came across some extreme mountain bikers, several other hikers and a couple who gave us confusing directions on how to reach one of the highest sections of the mountain. We got lost and ended trail busting which is highly discouraged but give us rules and we will break  em. During our run back down the trail I took a pretty hard fall face planting into the dirt, stabbing my right hand into a rock and banging up my knee. No broken bones or teeth, thankfully. We had just passed a couple of hikers when I took the fall so they saw everything. I laid there for about 10 seconds, jumped back up, noticed the blood, my torn tee and just continued on with the hike. We came across a park ranger who was standing outside his truck and asked if he had any medical supplies. Unfortunately, his first aid kit was about 20 years old and didnt contain anything that would help any of my wounds. We found a CVS on our way home and picked up some medical supplies and my wounds were washed and bandaged in the parking lot.  Probably my most memorable hike thus far."
3,"The venue, which is close to campus, usually gets all the big shows from Hot Hot Heat to Incubus to Mickey Avalon to Brand New. The great thing about the venue is that you can stand almost anywhere and still be able to see the band. Theres a big bar inside with friendly bartenders, although the well drinks can be a little pricey. Theres usually a hot dog vendor outside and most of the bands performing can be found walking around before and/or after their sets, making it easy to mingle. The downside about the Marquee is that parking sucks. Theres not a ton of parking in the clubs lot and the nearby lots usually fill up fast so be prepared to trek down Mill to get to and from your car if you dont arrive early."
3,"its an Imax theater, so unless you havent been to one then it you know it is an oversized screen with wider shots and better sound. The location itself looks dated and in need of some repair, perhaps just some paint. The viewing experience was great and I will go back if there is another flick being shown that I must see in IMAX, but the fact remains the Mall, the Theater and much of the area looks dated."
1,"Bad quality ingredients. I ordered a red curry beef and the beef was awful, hard, I tried to chew it for a minute and decided to give up."
4,"Finally Biltmore gets a sushi place after the departure of Ayako! Well if you have been to Stingray in Old Town Scottsdale, this is same menu, etc. But I happened to like the atmosphere at this location better! Came here for a happy hour, had a drink called the Tokyo Tease(delish!) and since I love sashimi sushi (which isn`t on the happy hour menu, no big deal), ordered my sashimi combo, which didn`t disappoint!! Included tuna, salmon and yellowtail. Did enjoy the bevy of assorted rolls that went by. I like the outside/inside seating bar- great on beautiful weather days! I will be back for more!!"
1,"If only I where rating this place based on their sushi I would give it 5 stars.  But, Im not  rating it based on the food.  It is purely based on the customer service in this establishment.  Be warned; if you have a large party this is NOT the place to go.  Ive been in the restaurant industry for over 20 years and I have NEVER heard of a restaurant not splitting checks for large parties.  So for an over 500.00 bill they will take 15+ different forms of payment but wont split up the check by individuals or couples.  How does this make any sense.  To make matters worse; they bring out the sushi and I quote ""family style"".  Since when did sushi get served family style?  Here is the problem.  Sushi is expensive, not everyone at the table ate it and when served ""family style"" someone else may get what you ordered and you wont have a clue it even made it to the table.  We spent over 40 minutes trying to figure out this bill, SERIOUSLY!  When I asked the manager her generic and obviously well rehearsed response was ""this is our company policy, we do not split checks for large parties"".  This is absurd.  So not only did we have a heck of a time figuring out the bill, Im pretty sure no one really knew who had what and if they had added random things to the bill.  How could you know with that many people ordering????  I never received part of what I ordered yet it made it on that bill.  So here we have to pay it regardless of what we may or may not have received?  I understand that adding gratuity to a party this size is also common practice which I dont normally have a problem with but how about some EXCELLENT customer service in return.  If policy is no separate checks, at least tell everyone as they order or as a group that this will occur.  They said someone was told when the reservation was made.  The reservation was made for 25 people!  It wouldve taken 2 seconds to again relay this important piece of information.  Worst experience ever!"
3,"I came here with a friend for a Groupon dinner.  We got an appetizer assortment , an entree each, and a house margarita.  The app plate came with mini chimichangs (yay), chicken taquitos (yay), cheese quesadilla (nay), and wings (ok).  I had a decent chicken fajita, and my friend loved her steak fajitas.  The drinks were a little too strong in my opinion.  Overall, I would need another try at this place without the Groupon deal, and see if they can execute more flavorful food."
5,"Good choice of ingredients, a bit out of a student budget, but it was WORTHY all the way. I was drooling with the flavors! Good environment and good service and good music (bistro style). Im not much of a pizza eater, but this has a good place in my list! Forget about your papa dough or cheap Sunday pizzas...this is a real one!"
4,Love this place. Quaint.  Nice owners.  The meatloaf is fantastic.  Reminds me a little of home in Mn.  .. . old house.
4,"Tried this place for the first time and had the chicken pho and and mongolian beef with red rice. All was delicious...but I especially loved their red rice, it was spicy and soooo good. Everything is very reasonably priced and you can even get it delivered from a service called You Buy and We Fly!!"
5,ouchh...my fuckin head is pounding this morning.  thanks a lot guys!
4,Good Date Night Spot!!!  Went here the other night for dinner and it was really good. I had the steak and my wife had the casa dilla of the day.  Both were cooked to perfection.  Sometimes nicer places have really small portions and seem to pay more attention to how pretty the dish is instead of how good it is but this place was spot on with both presentation and taste. We did not have a reservation so we sat at the bar which has full menu service.  The bar wraps around and near the mens restroom there is some additional bar seats that nobody sits at.  I thought this area might have been a little more private than some of the two person tables.  I also thought it was cool to be able to see into the kitchen but that might only be appealing to me.  The bartender was very knowledgeable and checked on us several times during our meal.  This place has a good vibe for couples doing the date night thing but there was also a table of 6 near us who were also having a good time.  Cowboy Ciao is a win win.  The desert donuts are ridiculously good as well.
5,"Love Love LOVE Bakers Nursery!!  Been going there since I was a child thanks to my grandparents (my grandad and uncle used to do roofing work for the owners decades ago).  Seriously...this place is FANTASTIC and the people who work there are AWESOME!   Want to know what plants/trees you have in your yard?  Bring in a leaf or bark sample and theyll tell you.  Found out we have Chinaberry trees(messy!), Lantana (evil and will not die!), 2 Trumpet vines (attracts hummingbirds!) and a Texas Sage bush (beautiful purple flowering bush) in our yard.  Want to know what type of tree would do well in your yard?  Just ask!   Need something transplanted?  Buy the pots and theyll replant your plants for you.   Buy a sad looking clearance plant from another local store, theyll tell you how to nurse it back to health.   I could easily wander around Bakers for hours, except during the heat of the day in the summertime!  :)"
1,This place is disgusting!!  The bun was dry and stale.  The veggie burger was yucky... I dont think I have ever had one I didnt like before.  The kids meals are miniscule.  The topping bar is so simple and plain.  The dips are not very good... cheese dip is YUCK!  Drink choices stink.  Cookies taste raw and boring.  Almost forgot to add that the two young kids didnt even care for the french fries because they are seasoned.  I thought they were a total waste of calories.  I cant believe the prices either... so not cheap or even worth what you pay for.
5,"I now have a sixth Sens for delicious Asian tapas- a genre I never knew existed. I always assumed the best tapas disappeared when Aaron May sauteed Sol Y Sombras last batch of butter-marinated brussels sprouts! Well, I was proven wrong when I hit up the ultra-cool Sens Asian Tapas & Sake on a Thursday night.  Guests are greeted by electric blue lights, neon pink lotus blossom light fixtures and fresh beats courtesy of a hipster DJ, which transport the hungry to an intoxicating, fluorescent experiens filled with sauces, sakes, and spicy flavors they probably dont even know about yet.  I tried three top-notch items: Wasabi Tofu- Hot, in every Sens of the word. Wasabi and 300-degree tempura crusties have the ability to burn you to your soul if you arent careful. Dont skip it, just poke it with a chopstick or blow on it first.  White Peach Juice and Vodka- Just like Japanese candy exchange students brought home in high school, its one of those miraculous flavors most Americans will never have the opportunity to try. Light and sweet, but not overly so, its a perfect blend you can sip all.night.long. (I did!) The best, by far, is the Hot & Sour Soup. Its nothing like the kind you get for .99 at Chinese restaurants as an appetizer. A Bilbo Baggins-ey cauldron arrives with a wooden ladle- among the various veggies and disc-shaped noodles is your choice of meat- I chose clams. Ive always heard you can truly tell how talented a chef is by how tasty his soup is, and would have to agree. Theres nothing to hide behind, and youre confronted by pure flavor. It was complex, different and mouthwatering. The whole Sens-ation was so genius, I even got past the embarrassment of Chef Johnny Chu snorting in my face for taking pics of my meal on my iPhone."
2,"I used to be a huge fan of this place, but it was just ok this time around.. A bunch of us went and I ordered their steak for two.. 22oz. Thought it might be good.  It was dry and had no flavor.  She had asked at the beginning ""Do you guys want A-1?""  I said ""No thanks.""  A good steak shouldnt need any sauce.  I should have asked for a ton of it.. just ugg.. We also got their artichoke, which was actually not too bad.  I love the one they do at Cheesecake  Factory. if you combine both, you have the ultimate smoked artichoke.   Everyone was ok with their meal and one of my friends loved his.  He got the chicken fried steak.  Cant really mess that up I guess.  it was pretty good.  Id go back, but Im not the fan i used to be of this place."
1,"I have have been going to Bosa off and on since they opened. Have a bad experience and stop for a while. Then I tell myself "" Its right down the street why not "" then disappointment again.  1. Went in on a Fri at 630AM for their special curler donuts, that they ONLY do on Fri. Sure enough nothing was prepared. Was informed it would take another 30 min to finish the donuts. Noticeable very, very, very irritated I ordered 2 other donuts instead. Was planning on a dozen, but had to settle for what they had. Well staff made sure to charge me a credit card fee due to my purchase being under $ 5.00. When you dont have what you advertise, you might want to waive the .50 fee. Or you will really piss off that customer. Common sense. 2. Customer service is horrible. See #1. 3. When I get home I have never received the correct dozen donuts I ordered. I dont understand it ???? Im perplexed ??? I dont think its anything personal. I just never get the correct dozen. They close the box, I pay and go home. Surprise. The donuts are OK nothing great and not bad they are donuts. They are convenient and close, but I must remember to pass on Bosa Donuts."
4,"The husband and I had driven by Hulas multiple times, saying it looked interesting but we were always on our way to another destination. We finally stopped in on their 3rd Anniversary and boy, are we glad we did. The wait for a table was probably 45 minutes, but the place was packed and in all consideration, it wasnt as long as other places weve been. Plus, we wanted to sit outside, since a band was going to be playing. (Who were awesome, btw.) Drinks were $3 all night, special anniversary prices, and we tried the Dr. Funk and the Painkiller. The Dr. Funk was delicious! The Painkiller is similar, but had cinnamon or another spice in it that I didnt care for.  I ordered the coconut shrimp egg rolls to get us started and they were fantastic! For dinner, I had the coconut encrusted butterfish and the husband had a pork plate. (Mine was delicious but the pork was just okay.) Our friends had steak tacos and a salad. The steak tacos looked so good, we had to come back a second time. The second time here, I had the steak tacos and the husband had the steak dinner. Mmmm, the steak tacos were totally worth it. (We also ordered the coconut shrimp rolls again - definitely a favorite.) For dessert, we got the brownie with macadamia nut ice cream. The brownie wasnt anything special but the ice cream was good. When we checked in on Yelp, we received $5 off our bill. This was a nice surprise! Totally check this place out - well definitely be back!"
5,"So, my friend and I went first to Yasu because we heard it was great. We were traveling on business and therefore using company plastic. So, we show up and the kid working the door says in a very ""Spicolli-like"" voice, ""uh.... our credit card machine is broken tonight""..... So we replied that we were on expense accounts and would there be any way they could manually run our credit cards... The guy replies, ""dude, youre outta luck"".... Funny, considering that I am a guy who eats out a lot and am not afraid to spend a lot of money in a place when the food and service is good... I wont be going back in there... So we made our way to Hiro..... We were pissed and hungry after driving around and dealing with idiots all over town. Hiro was just what the doctor ordered. We sat down and were greeted and served drinks right away. We put our sushi order entirely in the hands of our chef who did not disappoint. He brought out order after order of fresh delicious sushi and sashimi... We had beer, sake and a great night.... When it was said and done, we spent about $250 for the two of us which was a lot but well worth it..... Im sure you could go and have a great meal for much less, but we were going big and NOT PAYING!!!!!  Morale of the story is that Yasus children working that night ran us out and straight to their competition where we will be spending money in the future... Go check out Hiro!"
1,"I understand Im not dude and so Im not there to state at your ""twin peaks"" however, that being said I am there to buy a beer and when it takes the bartender 20 minutes just to get a beer Im over it. So I was never gonna come back but was forced with a group of friends who wanted to eat and was just as upset as the first time. Fries were soggy and our server disappeared. We all decided were not going back. Just because your a good looking server doesnt give you an excuse for sucking."
5,"I moved to AZ about five months ago and have had two tragically bad haircuts from two other ""salons.""  I wear my hair in a short pixie cut and its very hard to find someone with the skills to do it right so I dont  end up with a mans cut. I found Epic Salon here on Yelp and decided to give it a try. I could not be more pleased.  My appointment yesterday was with Chey and shes wonderful.  I am very exacting when it comes to how I like my hair cut and am fluent in industry terms so I can articulate what I want. Chey listened very well and understood what I wanted. She totally delivered.  I am so very relieved to have found her.  And at $26 (cut only, no blow out) its a real deal."
3,"Meh. As my fellow Yelper said to me a few days after we ate here: ""No Brio review, Im shocked!""  I didnt jump on writing this review because I was pretty underwhelmed by the experience. The ambience sucks, the service wasnt very good and the food was totally average.  My cursor is blinking at me and I still dont know what else to say about my time spent here.  Ambience- looks like an Italian cheesecake factory. Why are the collumns so huge?! Service- the bartender kept interrupting us to take our order when we STILL werent ready. Jeez, does it look like Ive moved my menu in the 53 seconds its been since the last time you checked? And then disappeared when we were finally ready.  Food-  -carpaccio, not bad but does it seriously need to be that huge? The two of us didnt even come close to finishing it.  -Mediterranean pasta, pretty much the only one without a cream sauce on the whole menu. They split it for us which was nice and it tasted all right with mushrooms and chicken and stuff.  -tiramisu came out frozen. They were super apologetic and didnt charge us for the replacement, but it was still awkward. They obviously just heated up a piece which made it melty and just not that great. So yeah, thats that."
4,"They have plenty of equipment so there should never be a wait for anything. They offer great classes, although they tend to get too full sometimes. It would be nice if there was a restroom up front so you dont have to walk through the entire shower/locker room if all you need to do is pee!"
4,Ive been for lunch half a dozen times and usually sit at the bar.  Their beers are great.  Im a home brewer and am pretty discerning in my beer tastes.  Their HopKnot IPA has a huge nose of hops if you are a hop lover--which I am.  However the 8th Street Pale is probably my favorite.  It is a great balanced English style pale ale--without the bitter edge of an American pale ale like SN.  On a hot day their Kolsch is super refreshing and reminds me of being in Germany.  Ive had mostly burgers and fries there and they are good.  The atmosphere is casual and the staff is friendly and attentive.  If you are a craft beer lover it is a nice laid back destination to enjoy a brew...or two.  They also pour growlers and sell cans of Kolsch and Kiltlifter in 12 packs.
2,TORTILLA SOUP = not the biz. thats all I tasted so thats all Im rating this place on lol
1,"Worst store in the chain - I agree with one poster that its not crowded but it also is out of items more than any other store.  It also is so understaffed its impossible to get help if you need it and if you ask someone that works here that you finally locate, my experience is that they wont know what your asking for anyway.  I recently was in the store asking about a certain item by Susan Lenart Kazmer, the person looked right at me and said oh we dont carry that artist you might try hobby lobby they get a little credit for trying to help but Susans line is a Michaels only item.  I gave the woman the line name and said no we dont carry that Im sure.  I pointed at the huge display in front of me of Susan items and her answer, Oh that must be brand new.  I said nope it came out three years ago now can you see if you have this specific item she said oh we cant do that and she walked off talking to her friend the only other employee in the store that i had seen.   Ok bad but any store can have a bad employee right.  so I go up to pay, a pleasant young girl asks me if I have a Michaels card?  I say sure do and hand it to her.  Oh thats not a Michaels card ours are red.  I explain that its a gold card for people who spend more money and that as a professional artist Im there quite a bit.  She says Ive never heard of that before.  Well its a Michaels card just read the front it says Michaels right there.  she stands looking at me so I said try scanning it I promise it will work.  She scans it and then says oh it says you have a $5  off coupon loaded on this card.  My response;  good you get a five dollar coupon for every 100 you spend.  Now she looks scared and says the dreaded words Im not sure,  let me call the manager.  So 20 minutes go by and who shows up the lady that argued about the Susan Lenart items.  They finally agree to try it and Im finally out the door just 40 minutes later.  And thats not even the bad part!   I went into this store to have something framed that was three weeks ago they tell me every day it will be the next day all to no avail they use every excuse imaginable custom frames take time, or custom mat colors are hard to get.   Each time I explain its a off the shelf frame there only cutting a black mat.  they say oh that should be fast will have it tomorrow.   I wouldnt shop here again if it was all free this store is a joke just keep driving and go to the large store at Power and McKellips its a much larger store with competent staff and about twice the selection.   Its well worth the drive and the cost of gas I live less than two miles from the gateway store and can still drive make my purchases and drive home much faster than trying to shop at the local gateway store.  They have even  framed two other items while Im still waiting for the Gateway store to cut a simple mat."
3,"Moira isnt the best sushi Ive ever had, but for Phoenix and my neighborhood and the pricepoint (as long as we dont order alcoholic beverages) is doable when we get a sushi craving.  The happy hour is a great benefit if you can get away from work before it ends.   Their spicy rolls are definitely spicy, and have some great kick to them. It hits the spot without breaking the bank and well take it."
4,"After paying $10 for a footlong Tuna and a drink at Subway (read the review), I was obligated to find new lunchtime stomping grounds. And Ive found one.  How someone is going to take points for ""ambiance"" in a Chicago style gyro eatery is worth my lolz. But, youre not going to a Chicgo style gyro eatery for ""ambiance"". Youre going for good grub, and a bottomless drink cup. This place rocks for what it is.  The decor is cool. I spent the vast majority of my meal staring at the posterboard sized photos of downtown Chicaga. I was lost and mezmerized at the fine details of the photos. I would bite, and stare. Bite, and stare.  And there was much to bite on. This pita came STUFFED with succulent, tasty meat. Im not a tomato fan, so I left those for those who are. My gyro was oozing sauce. I would take a bite, and while enjoying the deliciousness that permeated my over-stuffed mouth, contemplated what to do about the sauce on my fingers. KNOWING that if I dared to open my mouth, Id be looking at the food I had just started to chew, but understanding that if I did nothing with the sauce it would drip off of my fingers into the basket. Quite the dilemma, I tell you. Bite, and stare.... Ooooh! Look! Fries! Mmmmmmm....  I was there at 11:30 on a Thursday, and it was less than crowded. Parking was no issue.  All of this for less than $7. Yep. Ill take my $3, and give it to the bum on the street. Better than spent at Subway."
2,"No credit, weird layout,  not much fresh food"
1,"I have received two pedicures and a manicure from this location.  I usually prefer a more spa like experience but the cost is low and I was attempting to save a few dollars.  Cutting cost may not be a good thing to do when it comes to body care.  I wont be returning because I am concerned about health violations. Pros: Quick service Cheaper than the spa, salon Cons: Improper cleaning of foot baths.  I thought they were good until I saw them seat a women at a used station.  They only took the sprayer and rinsed the dirty bowl.  (I did let her know) The foot massage was more like a foot beating.  About an hour later my ankles felt like I had rolled them.  It took almost two weeks for them to feel normal again. The sent in the shop is of fake nails.  If everyone has on a mask, I would like one to."
3,"Im no regular here, but on occasion I get a craving for an Iced Mocha that tastes like chocolate milk. Tullys has that down. Thats the only thing Ive ever ordered here (I go elsewhere for my usual espresso needs), so I cant speak on the rest of their drinks. But, I dont imagine the rest of their drinks being bad; their Iced Mochas are very enjoyable. The service can be spotty. There are a couple ladies that work there that are sweet and take good care of the customers. But Ive also encountered a couple of employees that arent friendly and/or are super slow. Whatever; Tullys isnt my usual haunt. But its good for what it is: fast-food-coffee."
3,"I only did layovers in this airport to and from Colorado from California, but I liked it. There were a ton of places to eat which was fantastic. Their flights left on time, which was kinda annoying when we got in 10 minutes late and ended up getting stuck there for almost 3 hours. Free internet access helped with that though. Its an airport I dont mind being stuck in for a bit."
4,"I went here with my husband last Sunday afternoon.  We had a 2 for 1 coupon out of the Entertainment guide.  We are from San Diego and have been trying to find Mexican food places similar to the food out in San Diego.  We pulled up to the location and were debating if we should go in or not.  The area wasnt the best, and it was in a tiny strip mall.  Kind of looked like a taco shop.  We decide to go in, because we were starving.  Inside it looked completely different.  It was a little dark and dated.  But the atmosphere was very causal and the hosts were super nice.  We sat down and right away got some nice warm chips, salsa and beans served to us.  I was feeling like a margarita and was going to get the house one, when the waitress said they had 99 cent margaritas available.  We ordered our food and didnt have to wait very long to get it.  Super good food and really cheap 99 cent margaritas. The margaritas were served in pretty nice size glasses but a bit strong.  FYI, I think youre getting really cheap alcohol in there, seemed pretty stiff. I started buzzing after my second glass.   My husband even loved the Chile reino that he tried from my plate.  He usually doesnt like it at all.  The carne asada was seasoned very well, it was a great change from some of the bland Mexican food Ive had out here in phoenix. My husband had the beef chimichanga and it was seasoned really well also.  For the price you cant beat it.  From the outside the restaurant seems a little ghetto looking, but once you get inside its pretty nice in there.  I would defiantly try it again."
2,"Oh god.. I use to love this place its the closest store to me, and I have my safeway card so Im good to go.. place is a mess.  First the parking lot.. too small for the amount of things going on at this complex, I am shocked that there isnt a daily accident in the parking lot. People are impatient, driving down the middle of the rows instead of one sides.. I just got back from there and I was making my exit and three cars tried to go for my parking spot created a jumble mess, so much so I had to pull back in the spot so they could move.. ugh.  Inside the story, they seem to always always be stocking and never seem to be stocked.. When I go I can never fully complete my shopping list, there is always something not stocked so I have to come back or just go with out it.. But today took the cake.. Its just after one in the afternoon, every single row there was at least one person stock, blocking half of the row.. its 1pm! Usually by 1, stores are stocked up, maybe one or two things to go..  There was also a cockroach.. and not to sound snobby but the type of people that tend to go to this on, I feel I need to carry mace or have a buddy..  So I may go back for quick in and out shopping, but for big shopping trips Ill drive out of my to somewhere else.. even with the gas prices.."
4,"If only they had a place like Tryst Cafe back in California! The first and only problem I had with the place was the fact that I wanted nearly everything on the menu. They have amazing specials, and while the Monte Cristo breakfast sandwich and glazed-walnut French toast looked amazing, I was hungry and opted for the Hawaiian breakfast. The food came pretty quickly and was warm. We didnt order any drinks because the fresh-squeezed ones are so expensive its actually cheaper to buy one of their smoothies. The hawaain special- composed of 2 fried eggs, shredded Kalua Pork, cabbage and rice- was tasty, but a little bland. They gave my brother and I (we ordered the same thing) some soy sauce, but I would have preferred a nice dollop of ketchup instead of the sodium infested kikkoman. Other than that, the dish was delicious. They fried the eggs perfectly, the runny yolk making the rice and pork taste even better! I usually only like my eggs over-hard, so it was a pleasant surprise. My mom opted for the healthy option, getting the yogurt parfait. In my opinion, this was the disappointment of the table. My mom claimed that she loved it and that it tasted like Beijings yogurt. My mom must have some really refined tastebuds because all I tastes was some store bought low-fat vanilla. The granola was good and the berries fresh and few. What can you expect for $5? In my opinion, a little better than that. My dad, opting for the unhealthy option got the huevos rancheros. He ate it so quickly I didnt get a taste, so I can only assume it was tasty. Overall? Great choices, great venue, and good food."
4,"A Mexican friend  of ours recommended Arribas. We usually order take out, the 2 times I ate at the restaurant, service was poor and food was not as good.  Luckily, every time we order for take out the food has been very good. The chips and salsa are always fresh. My husband likes the chicken chimi platter and we had try the carne adobada pizza, plate and sampler platter. I like the way they seasoned the food, not too salty and you can taste the spices. Leftovers taste better (though maybe mushy) the next day. So, service and food at the restaurant will be a 2, but since I always have a great take out experience, Ill give them 4 stars"
5,"Wow, that is some great BBQ.  Probably the best I have had in Arizona.  The pork was great as were the BBQ beans.  I will be there again and again!"
2,"I had high hopes for the Habit since I live only a couple miles away, but it was mostly disappointing for me.  Im vegetarian, so I have no idea how their meat burgers taste, and they may be the best in the world for all I know, but the veggie burger was a tasteless lump for the most part.  I do give them kudos for having a veggie burger, but either put more effort into it, or take it off the menu and go full-on meat! The service was nice, and I like the design of the place, but there are too many good veggie burgers to be had in the Valley to waste my time eating this one.  Parking lot is super-cramped, so if you need your meatburger fix, then dont come right at 12 or 6, unless you want to park in someones yard."
5,"I have been saving my 100th review for my favorite restaurant of all time.  We found Thai Basil over a year ago now and have been loyal customers, going at least once a week and sometimes more than that, since last July. Everyone who works here is super friendly, and they know us now and know what we like to order by heart. We just walk in now and they see us and say ""Spicy noodle, tofu, hot, right?"" Its pretty great having a place that knows my regular order. I have tried most of the menu items. The garlic eggplant is also pretty great. The thai basil is also amazing. I have generally liked everything I have had here except the curry. I never have had a good curry experience. Both of the times I ordered it I ended up with long black hairs in it (which they quickly replaced with a new order) but I just wasnt a fan. Maybe its because of the coconut milk and it makes it too sweet.  The spring rolls are also the best here out of every spring roll I have had anywhere.  Before I went vegan again last year we also got the fried banana ice cream pretty often. That is pretty amazing. If you eat dairy, you have to try it at least once.  Thai Basil is one of our regular spots to eat out, and we hope its here to stay for many more years to come. I dont know what I would do without my spicy noodles!!!"
4,"I came here with a friend who has been here many times and recommended it.  I wasnt disappointed.  First, we came during the lunch rush and it was busy.  However, we were still seated immediately and served by a friendly waitress quickly.  The food then came out in about 5 minutes!  I had the rib tip plate, and it was very good.  My friend had the pulled pork sandwich which was also good.  Its out off the beaten path but worth the trip.  When you pull into a place out in a strange location, and its packed?  Good sign."
3,Great service. Good food. Had baked scallops. Reasonable prices
3,"If I were to have written this review 2 years ago, it would have been 5 stars, but the portions keep on shrinking at an alarming rate. Today I had the meat plate and no more than 2 tablespoons of pulled pork, and brisket were on the plate. Also, whats with the staff? They are like robot drones! Absolutely no personality! The foods flavor, and quality, however, are very good, the place is always sqeaky clean.. and of course the decor is very amusing. Being a hungry hungry hippo, I would prefer a slight price increase, to maintain portion size."
5,Absolutely sensational food.  We had the evening buffett. I will be driving 40min one way to eat here again.  Wow I just really enjoyed my meal.
5,"Like others, I found this studio through a Living Social coupon.  It is a great studio.  Kim is so friendly and fun.  I would highly recommend the yoga classes.  They are both challenging and relaxing!  It is a small studio, but that gives it a really nice, intimate feel.  I definitely recommend it!"
5,"This place is just so so rad. It was about time that AZ has a high end sneaker boutique. The selection of sneakers as well as clothes is above all. No kidding. I bought a pair of limited edition Jordans as a gift here. All of the sneakers here a so unique and fun, and it really puts the fun in sneaker shopping again.  Sure, you can go to finish line and get a pair of sneakers there. And you will see various other people wearing the same ones. If you really want to find funky stuff to express yourself with, this is the place. AND to make it even better...they sell for retail! So markups? Not an issue. Do yourself a favor and check this place out..."
3,"Been here 2 times.  Had I reviewed after my first visit, I wouldve given the place 4 stars.  The server was nice and attentive and the food and drinks were delicious.  Had I reviewed after my second visit, I wouldve given the place 2 stars.  The server was quiet and not as attentive and the food was cold and bland.  Since Im just now getting around to reviewing, I guess Ill give it 3 stars.  Really a bummer when you enjoy a place once only to go back and have a no-so-great experience."
1,"I keep wanting to like this place.  I want to support a local business, and yet.... Last year I took my two boys there after a theater performance (Greasepaint!   Excellent!), and after we placed our orders for lunch, I took out our SET game (its a card game that does not use a traditional deck - great fun).  WIthin moments, the server was back at our table.  ""You cant do that.""  ""What?  Play cards?  Its not gambling."" (Maybe I was wrong, but living here, you start to assume that an objection to something must be religion based).  ""The owners dont allow it.""  ""They dont allow it?  Its a matching game.""  ""No.  Youll have to put it away."" Now.  I would understand not wanting us to sit and play cards if wed finished eating and were just holding a table (assuming it was busy).   However, this was during the gap between ordering and eating.  I KNOW I shouldve just left then.  Instead, I made my kids happy and we stayed for lunch (and ice cream!).   A couple months ago I (foolishly) decided to try again.  Didnt bother with the cards this time.  The lousy thing this time was the mold on my sons bread.  They DID remove the sandwich from the bill, but eish.     Id kind of like the ""Restaurant Impossible"" guy to come in here and give it an overhaul.  I dont mind the nostalgia stuff, but the place does need a solid going over."
4,"The best caesar salad i have ever had. The scallops were tasty, but not as crispy as I like them.  My husband loved his steak. The chocolate lava cake is amazing.  Instead of a little oozing chocolate, there was a lot of oozing chocolate.  And their house chantilly cream is to die for.  I could eat it alone, by the spoonful."
4,"OMG, oh so good. Gives me gas and makes me tired after lunch, but its well worth it."
5,"So.......I love Defalcos. My bf and I are addicted to the Il Purista, which is JUST PERFECTION, with and without the prosciutto. Ive had someone describe their service to me as ""New York style"" and I agree with that assessment, so if you cant hang with it, then go be a baby somewhere else. The food is fresh, delicious, and incredible. Their lattes are bomb, and the cannolis pretty great too. I dont have a single bad thing to say about these folks or their amazing food."
3,"Went here on Wednesday to take advantage of the $30 certificate. It was quite busy, which probably shouldnt of been a shock, location and all, so had to wait awhile but that is the risk of not getting reservations right? =P.  Anyways, spent time in the bar which was nice, the bartenders were willing to answer questions, though not always the most chatty, but I think that was due more to how busy it was then not being friendly. The happy hour prices looked pretty good, $2 hot sake, $3 beer, $4-5 cocktails. Sushi was also on the cheap, Nigiri was from about 1.25-2 dollars I believe, and the other rolls ran from 3-5 dollars at the worst. They also have some non-sushi appetizers on there.  Once we got a table, we were paired with another group, which was actually a nice experience as I do like the communal type seating stuff. Granted if you have a small group and not a fan of eating with strangers, might not like it much.  Since it is a place I always consider more about a show then the food, going to start with that first. The show was eh, they do some of the knife play stuff, and a few things here and there, but honestly it wasnt all that exciting compared to the other place Ive been (Sakura). The chef was friendly though, and the server was personable so that is a plus. Otherwise was a bit disappointed with the show portion of the meal.  As for the food, I had the Filet Mignon and lobster tail. The filet was supposed to be medium, but came out more medium well in my opinion. It was lightly seasoned, leaving mostly a beef flavor then anything else. Now it had a good beef flavor, so by no means complaining just like a bit more seasoning personally. The lobster tail was good, buttery from the butter, but more importantly nice and sweet. How it is to other lobster tails? cant really tell you as I dont eat it that much (college students dont exactly have that sort of cash you know? =P). But again thought it was good, wasnt fishy and nice and sweet.  At the end it came with a choice of ice cream, I tried the green tea ice cream which about the same as any other green tea ice cream Ive had. Basically its sweet, with a hint of green tea taste, and that is about it.  They have to sing to you of course, and they take a picture which they give you with a code you can access for up to 60 days (I believe) to download it, which is a nice touch.  For the money, I really wouldnt go unless I had the certificate, however I would go back for the happy hour, probably my favorite thing of the whole night."
1,"Bleh. Most of us have ventured to the rock at some point in time. It has always been quite awful, but I had some hope after new ownership took over and renovated the place. It is always sad to see a place that has potential, be complete crap. Upon walking in we were greeted by a small room used as a bar area, with random bar tables along the side. And whales. And scary looking people. And a DJ...well...kinda...he was playing music from a computer..you know...like you would so at home. We ordered two beers and sat down. Why not give it a chance, right? Just when we thought that things couldnt get worse, we heard a sound. Like a squealing sound. Yes, you guess right, horrible karaoke ON A FRIDAY NIGHT!?!?! Why God, why????? We chugged our beers and left."
4,= = = = = =  CLOSED  = = = = = = China Star here has now closed.     :-(
5,Amazing. Romantic!
1,"Honestly the drinks are overpriced and have a hint of rubbing alcohol Honestly my lunch was just okay Honestly they have a drink called the stigmata Honestly I am dreading having to give them 2 stars given the hype But, I am supposed to be honest. This place has been the buzz since before I returned stateside. My coworkers had also been hearing the same buzz. We just had to go as the finale to our week of lunch. Yeah, I probably wouldve been better off at the Billet Bar across the street. I mean it is biker week. The people watching wouldve been stellar. The only people watching I had at RnR was the gorgeous server outside our window on the patio. But even his piece of art body wont bring me back. The first hint shouldve really been the overpriced drinks we started with. I figured for that price they should be damn good so I ordered some lime concoction. A coworker got the stigmata. Holy strong... and not in a good way. I mean, I appreciate my drink as much as the next but not when I cant even enjoy it.  One of my other coworkers on the other hand, was enjoying his blue moon. That was until he held it up to take another sip and the entire bottom of his glass fell off.. yes.. fell in one piece.. onto our table. What happened to the contents do you ask? That went all over him, the table, inside someones wallet, and onto an iPhone and my face. The waiter wasnt even really apologetic about it aside from giving us some extra cloth napkins which werent soaking anything up at all. No wet rag, no comp, no apology, nothing but another glass of blue moon we were hoping wasnt bought at a prank store and a sticky table, faces, and sunglasses. The chicken lollipops were not what I expected, but really werent bad. I did enjoy those. I also enjoyed the presentation of my fries. Cute silver bucket. Tons of fries. Couldnt finish. I ended up getting a chicken sandwich that had brie and some other goodness on it. Totally forgot to order it without tomato, but I picked it off easily.  I know what youre thinking, they serve breakfast here til 2pm, why the hell did the breakfast queen not order breakfast. Honestly, none of it wooed me enough that it looked delicious. They had a make your own omelet that was on my short list of things to order, but Im glad I didnt after seeing a coworkers tiny ass omelet and bread with no other side for $10. Also, I highly doubt their Amish french toast is all that Amish. Just sayin. I know a bit or two about Amish goodness. So, back to my lunch.. it was just eh, which was sad. The description sounded so delicious I really was expecting to be wowed.. finally.. after all the mishaps Id had up until this point. I do admit I loved the bread. It was delicious. I also appreciated that despite them not having honey mustard, aioli, or anything else to dip my fries in aside from ketchup and barbeque sauce (which was given with the sweet potato fries.. ew) they tried to make me honey mustard. Unfortunately it was just honey mixed in with bottle mustard ketchup. I ended up using the ranch dressing from the lollipops.  What I paid for this was ridiculous. The way they reacted to the beer mishap was ridiculous. The food was meh. Not even I was tempted to try breakfast there. It was like the beautiful model that has no brains.... and I want some brain thought going into my dining experience. Dont try to woo me with simple sex appeal. One of my coworkers commented that maybe in 6 months when the pans are seasoned well after being used the place will be worth it to try again. I told him maybe. Had to edit that someone from our table got terribly ill too... oy vey!"
5,"Had the best BEST time here tonight! My mama and best girlfriends treated to me a fun day for my birthday and I insisted on wrapping up the afternoon with happy hour on me. Ive never been but we wanted to go somewhere nice and stopped in.  The restaurant is beautiful- we sat in a high back comfy booth in the bar which is really nice. The bar has shelves of backlit colorful liquor bottles above it (ala the Ocean Club bar). We has 2 rounds, including the Vitamin C martini, White Chocolate Martini, Flirtini and Black Cherry cocktail- they were all really great! We also got the colossal shrimp appetizer (which technically werent all that colossal, they were just normal), the sliders (the bacon and maytag bleu cheese was amazing!) and the AZ Eggrolls (a bit on the greasy side but very tasty and perfect for happy hour). The tab was only $65 (it was happy hour and the prices averaged about $6/ drink and app). The service was also extremely good.  Its been a long time since I felt like raving about a restaurant- it was great!"
2,"I was working in Phoenix and was told that I had to try Delux, as they had the best burger and sweet potato fries I would ever have.  The fries were pretty good, but I dont think they were anything above average.  The burger, though, I thought left a lot to be desired.  It was juicy, but I would actually call it more grease-laden than truly juicy.  I like a moist burger, but I dont want grease dripping off the bun.  That was my major problem.  That may be what some people like, but I didnt."
3,"In 1999 the AZ Republic Voted Abacus Inn Best Chinese in the Valley. That is sad because Chinese can be so much better.  But I do have to say that Abacus Inn does something nice that I dont see too often in other Chinese Restaurants. They give you hot tea and water and fresh fried noodles with sauces when you are seated.  I had the Yui Shan Chicken, it was a fail because of the inedible Shiitake Mushroom stems in my dish.  Trying to eat the mushroom stem was like trying to chew a car tire but, I do have to admit the sauce was more developed than any sauced dishes I tried from the surrounding Chinese Restaurants including Bamboo Cafe, Ginger China Bistro, and Shangri La. I LIKED the use of cucumber in the dish was light and tasty and successful. Unfortunately the white meat chicken was dry. Maybe a THIRD STRING cook was on the day I was here and maybe this dish is normally prepared better? The sautéed spicy beef was more successful. The beef was very well prepared and unlike the Yui Shan dish this Spicy Beef REALLY WAS VERY SPICY. I am used to a more developed and balanced Szechuan sauce so I wasnt a fan of this dish from here. But I do note this sauce was better than what youd get from surrounding Chinese Restaurants. The last time I was here I had the sizzling rice dish and that one impressed me because they cook the rice quickly in a very hot oil and puff the rice. Its a toss up between Abacus Inn and Shangri la . Abacus does some more impressive stuff but Shangri la does cook moist chicken."
5,"Lots of cool, cute and educational things here for my two kiddies. I stop in here for each birthday/Christmas to balance out the ""junk"" toys. I love the art project portfolio that is divided by school year and the school memory books. :)"
3,"I adore all of Joes restaurants. That being said, I think this one is my least favorite..(which means its still better than most of the restaurants Ive had the pleasure of dining at in the greater Phoenix area.)  I got the chicken sandwich and it was okay. I think I could have found something on the menu that I would have enjoyed more, but for some reason I wanted to try it. I think Ill have to try the pizza next time, because it looked amazing. The service and atmosphere were great, as per all the Joes establishments.  I wasnt completely fond of standing in line for awhile to get a table and order my food. Sometimes I just want to sit down at a table and have the server come to me after a long day. That being said, I would love to try this place again...especially for breakfast!"
5,"Let me begin by telling you about my horribly debilitating fear of going to the dentist.  Its epic.  Weeks before an appointment I start having nightmares.  Thinking about sitting in the dental chair makes me break out in a cold sweat.  I require nitris oxide for a simple cleaning. The sound of the drill is enough to make me want to claw my face off.  Basically, every visit has been the worst experience ever for the past 30 years.... Enter Dr. Marcia Blazer.  I read about her online when searching for a local dentist here in Scottsdale.  I literally googled ""dentists for anxious patients"", and her name popped up.  Her website appeared too good to be true.  They offered nitris (plus), offered non invasive options for dental procedures (double plus), and offered a staff used to accomodating those with a healthy dose of dental fear. I went in for my first visit (a cleaning and exam), and I was amazed at how comfortable they made me feel.  They were warm and friendly, and put me at ease immediately.  During the cleaning, my least favorite part is always when they use the scrapy,pointy torture device to stab off all the plaque at the gumline.  How happy was I when they used an air abrasion tool instead...felt like a cool stream of water on your teeth, and BAM, theyre clean!  They were so calming, that when I was informed that I had 2 cavities, I didnt even have a panic attack at the thought of coming in. Fast forward two weeks to my filling appointment.  I had requested nitris (hey, I was feeling better but still SUPER anxious), which they had all set up in the room for me when I walked in.  Now heres my favorite part.  As I sat in the chair, the assistant brought over two big boxes full of dvds and asked me what movie I would like to watch during the procedure...What?? So I picked a lighthearted comedy (50 First Dates).  I was then given noise eliminating headphones to use (goodbye horrible drilling sound), nitris (hello happy gas), and a few hand signals to recognize if I was supposed to open or close my mouth.  And we were off!  She didnt try to maintain conversation (soooo annoying when dentists do that), and before I knew it she was done and I was disappointed because my movie wasnt quite over!  I was even told that had my dentist not needed the room I was in for another patient, that I would have been welcome to stay and just finish the movie! I have had several interactions with this office since then (regarding billing and follow up), and every time it is a pleasure to deal with them.  I highly recommend this office to anyone!"
4,"This is our theater of choice in N Scottsdale.  An older theater with no stadium seating, it is still kept in good shape and is clean.   Great prices at $5 a ticket before 6:00, it is the best bargain around since they still show all the new releases!  Our main reason for going here it is never crowded and personally I only like sitting next to someone I came with :0). Thats never a problem here!!"
3,"I had lunch at Villalpandos with a group of co-workers and this place is A-OK. The food wasnt spectacular, but everyone was satisfied with it and the prices are reasonable. The restaraunt was not very busy which makes it an easy place to go to with a large group. The service was friendly and had no problem with making substitutions to the menu items. I do like that they offer chile relleno thats not breaded and fried!"
5,"My husband and I eat out a lot and we had the best dining experience ever the other night! We sat at the bar with the bartender AJ and he was such a delight! We had happy hour which was probably the best deal in town! 5 dollar glasses of wine and half priced appetizers!?! My favorite was the steamed mussels. We loved it so much we also had dinner. The classic pasta deal was the best. Getting to take one home gives you at least two more meals, the next day. Its hard in this economy to get more bang for your buck but Maggianos they are doing it right! We will defiantly be back for more!"
4,Awesome little hole in the wall in Tempe.  There isnt much room to sit and it isnt fancy but if you want good food this is the place to go.  A pasty is basically a calzone(only better) with a variety of different types of fillers.  I had the bangers and mash.  The wife had the Italian.  Everything was great served promptly and with a smile.  Its not Scottsdale fancy and thats what I like about it.  Best part is you can get a hearty meal with a soda for under $10.  If you want beer expect to pay a bit more.
5,Great fruit and vegetables. Bulk items like nuts and cranberries are a good value. Check out the meat and deli. Cage free chicken and grass fed beef. Salmon and Tuna are fresh. They do have some good values here. The cashiers are good and give the nickel bag discount.
5,"Just a quick update.... Took my parents here for lunch today, and now I have 2 more converts! If anyone is still sleeping on this place, shame on you; youre really missing out. Why? DELICIOUS food made from QUALITY ingredients and FRESHLY prepared hot to order. Good stuff all around!"
4,"FAN-FREAKIN -TASTIC! Yes, its a Great steakhouse... but they also have a Great wine selection... and Great bread to start... and Great desserts.... and Great service. Rich and Richie took exceptional care of us.  They were attentive and fun to talk to... too. I had the Prime Rib and it was huge and perfectly prepared. I ended up taking the rest home and having it for lunch the next day and it was just as good the following day.  :) The Bread to start came with 2 different flavored butters.  You could easily fill up on bread before dinner.... so go easy on this as they will keep bringing out refills if you let them. The Dessert.... we got the Chocolate Lava Cake... and the cake part was good... but the sides that came with the cake... they were Amazing.  The Chantilly Cream they serve on the side of the cake is freshly made and its a Little Pillow of Heaven.  Rich brought us more when we ate all the cream and still had cake left.  And then they have a little homemade pistachio cookie with vanilla ice cream on the side too... these were great too... So, net, net... I wouldnt order the Chocolate Lava Cake for the cake part.... Id order it for the things that come WITH the cake.  :) Good for special occassions and if you are looking to have a lovely evening out."
4,"On a Friday night restaurant was busy, but the service was top drawer. Food was very good and we will be back. Prices reasonable."
4,"I think there food is amazing!  However, it is a bit pricey which limits my trips there.  I love the white decor but hate how expensive the drinks are!  I ordered a Key Lime Martini and it was 15.00 for one and served in a tiny little glass!  Come on! Additionally, last time I was there we went to the bar afterwards and most people were wearing flip flops which drives me nuts!  Take a shower, get dressed, put some effort in!  Save the flops for the pub!  Hopefully, it was just an off night because I really think it is a cool spot!"
4,"Im not normally a big fan of Italian food, but after marching six miles against 1070 in the Memorial Day weekend heat, I decided it was time to slang my Groupon on the table and carb it up.  And, fortunately, this was my favorite Groupon find yet. Aiellos is in a beautiful building.  I dont think a building has ever detracted from my eating experience, but in cases like Aiellos, the wonderful shaded, verdant patio set the mood in all the right ways. The inside is low-key family restaurant with a dash of romance.  Nice lighting, not too loud, cool bar. The food was awesome.  Delicious, probably house-made pasta with simple flavors that let the sauces and vegetables sing.  An exhaustive - but not daunting - wine list - though itd be nice to see more options served by-the-glass. As icing on the cake, at the end of the meal, you get to play a game that might let you get your meal for free.  I wont ruin the surprise, but it adds a lot of character. If I had an Italian grandmother, this is the sort of food Id expect shed make.  Highly recommended for a date night, classic dinner-and-a-movie style, for unpretentious delicious fare."
3,"ok....first let me say that I grew up in PHX. And we used to go for special occasions to ""Bobby MaGees"" which is where BobbyQs is now located (says something about the quality of my restaurant experiences as a young fella)...And as cheesy as Bobby McGaees was...i kind of miss the pirate serving me my dinner (and the salad bar in the bathtub). But i do like what they have done to the place. Cool interior. Casual but with a nice upscale feel. The patio seemed really nice (didnt sit out here). We tried a variety of things. A burger, a pulled pork sandwich, brisket, baby backs etc... I think the standout were the ribs. VERY good...very tender (but not overcooked), good sauce.  I enjoyed every one.Everything else was just ok. Like on par with Chilis (which isnt saying much).  The sides were pretty tasty. Corn (roasted and then taken off the cob for you) , mashed potatoes, cornbread...all pretty good.  Dinner for 4 (2 kids, no booze)...50$. But a 5 star place? Maybe in the context of other restaurants in the Dunlap and I-17 areas (next to crazy Mitchs Furniture barn.) But not in the broader context of PHX. I would definitely go back for ribs...but not a place that will go into the normal rotation. Side note: Hilarious crowd on a Saturday night. Lots of ""west side"" clubbers...or maybe too old to be clubbers but want to go clubbing (there is a lounge attached)."
4,"dropped by for lunch with 90yr old and 2 yr old plus hubby. all in all very good. hubby had sausage samich w/fries he really enjoyed it. baby had spaghetti and meatball she ate real good which means it was real good. mom had catfish w/spaghetti and marinara, she ate more than half and the rest went home with her. i had chicken marsala w/marinara on ziti. i subbed the wedding soup for the salad. the service was very quick and attentive. the lamb appetizer was just right with the bread. everything was tasty and very nice presentation. will be back soon, very convenient, very reasonable prices plus a full bar for happy hour. pizza looked very promising, too. take out may also be in my future relationship with lil deemos."
4,"This place is sweet. They are not big on china, glassware or silverware. They use recycled products plates, plastic-ware and drinks in the container they come in (ie a coke in a coke can). The ambiance is awesome. Sweet and funny signs everywhere, reading material, classic rock playing. They only have the radio on but there always seem to be great songs on! They have a large patio out back that is difficult to see from the front but is really nice on a sunny morning.  I havent gotten past the breakfast bowls yet. $6 for 6 toppings, potatoes, buttered toast, and jam. Go ahead and eat carnivore, omnivore or herbivore style (not sure if there are vegan options). Seriously, this $6 breakfast bowl would be $12 at other places served on fine china and with silverware! I dont care about accoutrements like that. Especially when the food is so tasty. The location, midway point of the Melrose District, is stellar. You can spend hours walking up and down looking at retro shops and cool little places. Two Hippies sets a perfect tone for hanging out on 7th Ave!"
5,"I went for brow threading.  Yelena was extremely gentle and took her time making sure they were perfect!  I just found my new ""brow lady"" and shes just across the street from my office! LOVE IT!!!  Give her a try!"
5,"Just because i feel like doing something different. :P im just going to paste some song lyrics that i feel sum up Pei Wei on McDowell... Truth is here the truth is here Truth is here the truth is here Truth is here the truth is here I said the truth is here the truth is here I want more Give me more We want more God damn it Im back to demand we get more We want more I want more and more and more I want more We need more I want more God damn it Im back to demand we get more Give me more I want more and more and more [Verse 1:] I stand here naked as the day I was born Face to the dawn and my faith in the song Blood soaking the pages I painted em on And none of yall will take my place when Im gone Im the pure raw uncut, who the fuck want what Here to show you sucker ass mutts whats the fucks what Brother Ali vow solemnly not to die while the music is still inside of me Its got to be allowed to breathe Got to let it out enough at least to let the monster flee I want more than what your offering me Songs that make me feel like Im already free Im a rebel in my own right Yall dont want to write or think or speak a rhyme standing next to me When the game need it Im exactly what it need Put the soul in the speech, let it go, let it be [Chorus: x2] I want more We need more I want, god damn it Im back to demand we get more Give me more I want more and more and more I said the truth is here the truth is here Truth is here the truth is here Truth is here the truth is here Truth is here the truth is [Verse 2:] Not nearly a single solitary soul Still put the kind of passion to the mic that I hold One day itll have to be pried from my cold dead hand Until then the big man is gold Got one lone reason to go on breathing Climb into the zone of the evening, keep reaching Just to pull more out the core of the deamon The people need to see them pure human being Blood, sweat, love, hate, life, death, joy, pain Little child running wild striped to the raw veins Rugged junkyard dog off the chain, barefoot balls out marching in the rain Sacred war dance suspended in the moment We throw the fuck down like our lives depended on it Jaws of the streets with our heart on our sleeve Throwing shots at the law which is all I believe [Chorus x2] [Verse 3:] Our songs are supposed to be the voice of our soul Not bought and sold, not all controlled Bring a little fire when the world get cold Let me shed a few tears and to me you went gold People need more freedom Children need to hear more truth when yall teach em Damn I want to hear a plan from the dude preaching Got new seeds with true needs and whos leading I truly believe every word Ive ever uttered on a drum break Right or wrong, life go on but it wasnt nothing fake I demand you start listening to the crowd If not - we gon burn this bitch to the ground [Chorus x2] I said the truth is here the truth is here Truth is here the truth is here Truth is here the truth is here Truth is here the truth is the atmosphere is pretty hot here too..exposed brick always makes me Yelp!"
4,"Ive never been to a small size airport like this before so its hard to compare it to another airport. I really enjoy the small size of it, makes it unique. There are basically three buildings, you have the front check-in building, the back building behind the courtyard with gates 1-4 and then a middle building to the side with gates 5 and 6 which also has the baggage claim on the other side of the wall.  I personally prefer Sky Harbor because I can ride the light rail straight there, but this airport does have a bus with half hour frequency. Take route 184, Power Road southbound and it drops off right across from the front door. Everyone seems more friendly here too, probably without having the masses wearing them down everyday, the employees here still have a personality lol.  Great low priced fares from Allegiant, good service, resonable food and drink option and it looks like they are expanding for Spirit Airlines to join this fall (2012). Overall a very good experience, I would suggest this airport as an alternative to anyone living out here near Mesa or if you dont mind the hour drive from the West Valley. I will most likely use this airport again."
5,"We tried this last night for our date night.  We were impressed.  The waitress was amazing in explaining the menu and making suggestions. This is a great place to relax and talk.  The food was great.  I had the Tartiflette...WOW it was so good.  My husband had the La Potence, which is their speciality.  He thought it was great...We will be back..."
4,"Pho is great every time, service is fast and friendly, potstickers are the best I have ever had and they are only $3.50.  Plus %10 discount for Intel employees."
5,"Cibo! Cibo! Cibo!  I love you and your cute old farm house, your amazing pizza, affordable wine, awesome crepe desserts, and fabulous staff! I want to live in the apartment above the restaurant!!  Go to Cibo for awesome food, charming atmosphere, and a great time for a girls night or on a date.  Cibo has quickly become my favorite place in Phoenix!  *Theyre closed on Sundays...found this out the hard way."
5,"This is a cool dive away from all the Old Town BS. The jukebox is one of the best I have heard in some time. They were playing songs I never heard of so I know Im going to be in trouble in the future by using Shazam to identify songs and then buying them from my phone! Anyway, just be sure you eat before you get there as this is all about hanging in a dive and having drinks. They have lots of beer and the bartenders are cool. If I lived closer I would hang out here much more......"
4,"We were staying at the Marriott Canyon Villas and went to Roys for Happy Hour.  Between 4:00 - 6:00 Roys has a great Happy Hour.  $5.00 drinks, including their Hawaiian martinis and $5.00 appetizers.  We had lobster pot stickers, tuna sushi, and California rolls.  All were delicious.  Ive never eaten a meal at the restaurant but if you want a nice little buzz and a pretty full stomach in a lovely environment on a paupers budget, this IS the place.  Dont miss it if you are nearby."
5,The whole market is awesome.I like that if you did not bring enough cash with you that you can pick up a blue ticket at the information booth that the vender will stamp then hold your items for you then you may pay by credit card at the information table where you picked up your ticket.The veg are great.the free range eggs are the best.the french baker from Tucson is pretty darn good.this market is for sure one of the better ones I have seen.worth any one checking out.Note support your local produce and growers/farmers.Support Organic!! One more note this information and option has to do with the farmers market out side open on the weekend from 7am to 11am
4,"Had a nice dinner here with some friends and family last Saturday night and it was really good.  The eggplant parmesan was good, but two of us could have split it.  They serve it on top of a big pizza crust, so it is very filling.  My son had the God Mother pizza which had bacon, pesto and fresh mozzarella.  The pizza was in the shape of a guitar.  He liked it, but wasnt thrilled with the bacon.  It would have probably been better with just the two main ingredients.  The restaurant is casual and hip at the same time."
4,Very interesting sweet and sour had kind of a spice to it but good. The pork itself wasnt my favorite but it was good. The rice was very sticky. Unfortunately I had to get it to go so  I missed out on a lot that the great food specials have to offer. But I would def go again.
3,"I went here this morning for breakfast with the BF to use our living social deal. We had been to black bear before about 6 years ago in glendale and then again maybe 4 years ago up in Washington state. The last time we went, we were not terribly thrilled with the place. Anyway, we decided to give them another shot and it was pretty decent. I had the shasta scramble, which has avocado, onion, bell pepper, and spinach. This was good, it was not the most flavorful scramble I have ever had, but the veggies were fresh and I liked that this was an option on their menu because most places only have one veggie scramble and it has tons of veggies thrown in with no reason for those veg to go together...anyway, the breakfast came with a ton of country potatoes which I liked more than the typical hash brown. The BF got the one biscuit and gravy breakfast and he said it was alright, not the best ever, but not bad. I thought breakfast here was better than Dennys or Ihop, but clearly not as good as the Farmhouse or Liberty Market and the like of local breakfast places. The service was also good, but I thought it was so weird because our waitress kept calling us kids and calling me sweetie, princess, and honey. I find this somewhat condescending, not that I think that was her intention, but I think that is unnecessary. I know this is kind of a diner thing, but I have never really cared for us, but maybe thats just me. The waitress was good at her job and attentive though, so that is whats important. Also, the portions are huge and I wish they had more options for half meals because I dont like to waste food, but I know people like the giant portion thing.... I would probably come back here for breakfast again sometime, however, because it is decently priced and has decent flavor."
3,"I went to this place on a friends recommendation, but have only eaten the custard. The lemon is quite refreshing and fluffy although I wish is was a little less sweet. This is a great place to visit after a light meal in downtown Mesa if you are looking to satisfy your sweet tooth, but not go overboard. The service is fantastic and the parking is ample as they have a private lot. The inside of the restaurant is quite charming and diner like. If you are really looking for the full experience of frozen custard, eat it outside in the never-ending, relentless Arizona sun...you will truly feel the refreshment!"
5,"Last week, I had my first appointment at Pure Dental. Dr. Kang and the office staff were all really nice and helpful. Dr. Kang even did my cleaning and it was very thorough. Ive never had the actual dentist give me my cleaning. I was wowed by their modern equipment to view x-rays and the doctor even took pictures of my teeth to show me. I will be going back to get some filings next week and was told I could watch a movie while I was getting them done."
3,"I think I went the wrong way, but I ended up doing a very isolated trail that wasnt too scenic, but at least it was quiet.  It sort of just ""ended"" though and didnt wrap around.  So then I walked the same way back which was kind of boring.  I like trails that are on loops."
3,"I dont usually write reviews very often (in fact ever).  But I felt that the 4.5 stars does not currently reflect my previous sushi experience here.   First off, the service here was really good.  The waitress was really nice, very prompt and courteous and provided the food quickly.  The food itself, was prepared well, I usually eat a lot of nigiri and the pieces are ok in amount of fish, the rice was packed well and the quality of the fish was good. The major downside in my opinion is that its pricier than I expected.  I wish Yelp would provide ""2.5 dollar signs"".  Granted, I did not come for ""Happy Hour"" which ends relatively early at 5pm.  I go to a lot of sushi restaurants and for the amount of fish provided, I would have expected it to be cheaper. Also, the edamame cost $$.  Even the miso soup is not complimentary.  Considering the above average price, Ive been to too many other places that have the same price, same quality, and provided the necessities for free.  Oh, I even forgot that a bowl of white rice for my child was even a charge.   So, the nickel and dime of things I would have expected compounded with the surprisingly above average price, I can only say that Yen Sushi was ""ok"".  The other two people in my party (minus the children) also agree."
1,"Avoid at all costs. Awful service, slow as hell, only uses disposable plasticware/plates to add landfill insult to heinous food.  Despite telling them we were in a rush to catch a plane and multiple reassurances that the food would arrive in plenty of time, they lollygagged around and I ended up paying $30 to be seriously pissed off and hungry with no food.   BLECH."
1,"what can I say about Glam... well, i really, really despise it. Every time I go there, I regret the decision. And in my grandiose style, Im going to say why in a list: 1) Cash only!! But listen to this, the bartender will take your debit card, charge you a fee, and give you cash, which you can then use to buy drinks from the same bartender that just did the whole transaction. WHY????  2) The location kinda blows. Its in a weird strip mall across from another strip mall. Have you ever driven by there in the day time? Its shady then, imagine at night time. 3) too hipster. I feel like I am not allowed there as I work for the man, do not wear black leggings, or have razor cut bangs. I, in my mall clothing and ""mainstream"" style, stick out like a sore thumb. 4) The music is just a little off.... ii dunno how to say what I am thinking, its just off. Okay, the floor is fancy. Thats about it. (sorry, Im a bar snob and Glam deserves my wrath)"
5,"Dr. Farnsworth is the Jam. I had my first ever eye exam, and she was kind enough to take good care of me.  She did a complete, and thorough eye exam, and explained each test, and the importance of them. After the exam, we determined, that I indeed needed glasses. At that point, my prescription was handed over to the very sweet optician who took care of me and let me try on about a dozen different frames before I found the winning pair. Ive sadly lost them in Vegas, but I will soon be back to buy my next pair so that I am not blind as a bat. LOVE YOU GUYS!"
5,"I have lived steps away from this place for years and a few months ago, my boyfriend suggested I give it a try. Since Im very picky with mexican food places, I had doubts, but boy was I wrong! All I can say is wow!!! This place is amazingly delicious. I thought I would never find a place who served authentic Mexican tacos and out of the blue I found it in a hole in the wall strip mall and just steps from my house! This can be a good thing, but also a dangerous thing because I am trying to lose weight.  This place is so good. I got two tacos and I know I will be going back again and again."
4,"I would echo many of the positive things others have mentioned about Phoenix City Grille. Everything I had here was just downright good. Ribs were mouthwatering, fall off the bone, marinated fresh each morning and not overcoated, perfect. Really didnt even need the sauce they had such flavor already. Black bean soup was nice and the chopped salad was real good too with a nice peanut dressing. Nice wine list with plenty of affordable by-the-glass options. And the server we had was nice too, my companion and I stumbled in after a hike to Piestewa Peak and were definitely underdressed, but everyone was nice about it and they clearly wanted out business and valued us as customers. If I lived in this area of Phoenix, this would be in my rotation for sure."
5,"I first saw them Saturday morning at the Phoenix Public Market and told myself that I would have to try them soon. I was too full from all the sampling with the different vendors. My coworkers and I went to check out the food trucks that gather on Thursday outside of Whole Foods by Raintree and the 101. I saw that Mojo Bowl was there and made my mind up right away to get their food. I decided to get the Red, White, and Kale salad. I love quinoa and kale so it was the obvious choice for me. I also wanted to try one of their smoothies out. I went with the Coco Coca. The description mentioned that it was like a drinkable Almond Joy and I was sold right there. The total came to $13, not too shabby considering the portions. I didnt even touch my salad because the smoothie was so fulling, definitely a meal in itself. Towards the end of the work day I was getting hungry and decided to try some of the salad. I was asked if I wanted a balsamic or raspberry vinaigrette to go with the salad. I told the guy whatever tastes better and he told me that would be the raspberry vinaigrette. The salad was delicious. The kale was chopped up so finely that it really didnt have a taste so if youre not a huge fan of kale you might still like the salad. The portion was huge, it was good for 2 meals.  I try to eat healthy and like to support local businesses. Mojo Bowl definitely brings those two together for me. I cant wait to try more of their smoothies and food out soon!"
5,"Great service, atmosphere and of course great food. My wife and I decided on Blue 32 last night for dinner. We have been there many times, but we felt we needed to share our experience.  We enjoyed sitting at the bar having a few drinks and visiting other patrons. Around 9:50 we realized the kitchen would be closing. I asked Daniel and Baeley the bartenders what time the kitchen served ""dinners"" of course he stated 10:00pm ""OOPS"". But Daniel said they would prepare what ever we wanted.  I asked him to check to see if they have already started to clean up first. We do not like to ask the kitchen staff to prepare dinner if they had already began or completed clean up. Daniel returned to say that yes they had finished the grill, but he again repeated that they would still prepare anything we wanted. At that time we declined to have the kitchen staff prepare anything. But a moment later, Roman the chef came up to us and sincerely stated that he would be more than pleased to prepare whatever we wanted. Still we were not wanting to make such a request  that late, but with his sincere and friendly personality he still insisted that they were more than willing.  So we asked him to pick  and prepare something of his choice which turned out to be the best two burgers that we have enjoyed in a long time, a Bacon Cheese Burger and his speciality Texan Jalapeno  Burger both with extra crispy bacon just the way we like it. SOOOOO....we would highly recommend Blue 32 and its staff including by name, Roman the chef and Daniel and Baeley the bartenders.  Every time we have gone to Blue 32 we have had nothing but a great experience, this place is a must!!!"
5,"This is not a fancy place.  Its address is on Scottsdale Road, but its easier to get to from Shea, about a block east of Scottsdale.  Its split into two sections.  As you walk in, if you head to the left, there is a bar with a couple of pool tables.  I cant really say that Ive spent any time in that section.  We head to the right, where there is a central bar, with booths along the walls.  If you are into Karoake, this is a great place to go.  The DJ has a great voice, and many of the usuals do as well (of course there are quite a few who dont, but thats to be expected).  Weve been here dozens of times, and never not had a good time.  Its casual, and very reasonably priced.  The food is way above average for this casual of a bar.  The shrimp are spiced to perfection, and the chili is to die for."
4,"I went here with a party of 4 on Saturday night and it was surprisingly dead.  Not that thats a bad thing because I dont like crowds.  The place is pretty sheik but you still feel like youre in a hotel.  Service was fast and friendly but I think it was our waiters first night or something.  He was very awkward but it was ok. I was pissed we couldnt get the happy hour menu/prices in the main dining room.  I know it is common practice for crowded places full of douchebags, but the bar and the main dining room were pretty empty so wtf? Im a vodka guy and their vodka menu is pretty neat.  They have 8 or 9 unique vodkas from around the US and clearly list their name, where they are from and the price.  What I didnt like was their martinis.  Pretty much the worst Ive ever had anywhere.  Tiny pours and full of ice chips.  It was like a vodka slushy (oh snap I think I just invented something!!!). Here is a rundown of the food: * bread to start - excellent...love the lightly buttered and salted top * tomato and mozzarella salad - excellent - one of the best ive ever had.  great dressing and ample balls of fresh mozzarella. * pretzel fondue - the pretzels were excellent but the fondue and mustard were no bueno.  the fondu was gritty and the mustard lacked the kick that I love on pretzels. * burger - pretty solid but nothing special * mac n cheese with Shriners sausage - very unique and very tasty.  it was worth having once but I wouldnt get it again. * tater tots - perfectly cooked.  salty/crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the inside.  The only thing that would have made these better is some type of aioli or other special dipping sauce other than ketchup. The main dishes of the other people in my party looked excellent.  I should have been more adventurous and gone with something more than a standard burger.  Maybe next time.  I was going to give this place 3 stars but I just cant.  They try to think out of the box to create dishes that are unique, have fresh ingredients, and have a local twist.  I will return."
4,"This was our last stop on the Urban Wine Walk yesterday, and it was a great place to end the day.  Because this was our last stop, we were too late to get the wine special, however we decided to stay and grab a table on the gorgeous patio and get a (full) glass of wine.  We also ordered some sweet potato fries to munch on. The patio was awesome and I love how the ""inside"" opened up to become an extension of the patio, or vice versa.  We were lucky enough to be experiencing one of those perfect Arizona days and I felt like I was sitting in a good friends cute, cozy backyard . . . with table service.  Speaking of the service, no complaints from me! The original plan was to get dinner, but the wine, fries, and good conversation were enough to fill us up and take us to the end of the night.  I cant wait to go back (soon, to enjoy the patio) and try all of the delicious food I was reading about on the menu and now in everyones reviews!"
4,"When you go to a place called ""Fajitas"" you order the dang namesake! Ive had all the different fajitas they offer and I love all them, my favorite is the shrimp its lightly seasoned and grilled to perfection (side note: order the onions and pepper caramelized)! The tortillas are strong enough to fold without tearing yet still have a nice flavor. The toppings are always bright and fresh, the guacamole is legit. My coworker has talked me into always ordering a side of Queso with the free chips and salsa. Albeit the restaurant is old but the staff is super friendly and detail oriented. And yes, no matter what you order you will smell like fajitas so make sure you dont have anywhere special to go after eating here."
5,I try and eat here regularly. Hummus is great. Very personable staff. And the atmosphere is awesome. Look forward to the next time!
5,While we were in Mesa AZ for a holiday we found Alessias on Yelp and we are so glad we did. The food was delicious and the host was terrific as were the servers. We are not big wine drinkers but they have a very good selection of wines and the host knows his stuff and can make good recommendations. Nicely appointed little restaurant with a great menu.
4,"I am a huge fan of the Italian beef and of course everyone is going to have their favorite places and tastes. But this seemed like a place to satisfy a lot of different tastes. There are several sizes, extra meat is available and if you are getting it to go, Id say go for it! Only order it regular if you are a fan of super dry sandwiches. Id say go for wet if you are like lightly moist but if you are a big au ju fan like I am, definitely hook it up with the dipped!! They have american, cheddar and provolone cheese (pretty sad they didnt have the mozzarella). They giardiniera was pretty good as were the sweet peppers. It wasnt too greasy or hard to eat while driving. They did have a variety of other things to eat so definitely check those out if you arent up for a beef...but thats what they are known for!!"
4,"Enjoyed sitting outside and the barra viejo shrimp dish.  I didnt find anything ""to die for"" but its good.  More importantly it was a nice evening and I enjoyed the experience very much.  My waiter was very laid back and friendly.  I didnt feel rushed and was able to have a relaxed dinner.  Case in point- Im usually a one-drink girl, but I had 2 that day."
5,"I am a transplanted Midwesterner, so I love me some breakfast.  And by breakfast I mean:  Hashbrowns, sausage, bacon, pancakes, and biscuits and gravy.   Mike and Rhondas makes a mean breakfast with huge portions.  For $7 you can have bacon/sausage/ham with hashbrowns, 2 eggs, and biscuits & gravy/pancakes/toast.  Come hungry or share. They also serve classic american lunch fare:  burgers, chicken strips, fries, meatloaf, etc."
4,Great chai lattes and friendly service!
4,"House of Tricks is a great place for dinner if youre looking to go out for a special occasion. Its not somewhere Id go on any given night, seeing as how the bill is about $100 for a dinner for two.  I appreciated the menu having a good deal of seafood on it, as I dont eat any red meat. We had the scallops as an app. - while the serving was small (as expected), the scallops were the prettiest ones I have ever seen! For dinner I had the ahi tuna - it was WAY bigger than I expected, I couldnt even finish it - but my date didnt hesitate to finish it for me.  We sat outside as the sun was setting. The atmosphere was pretty much perfect except for one thing. We were seating next to the concrete wall separating the restaurant from the street. If youre sitting at the tables next to the wall, Id say it comes up to your elbows. Anyway, there were ants crawling all over the wall and it made me kind of uncomfortable and itchy.  Our server was a young guy who could have washed his shirt a few times before wearing it again. Otherwise, he was pretty cool - sort of a no sense of urgency kind of server - but we werent in too much of a hurry anyway."
3,The felt that the food at Organ Stop was just So-So! Nothing special! The Music there is great! You defiantly go to Organ Stop for the Organ! Not the Pizza!
5,Postinos in Gilbert was stunning! Amazing outdoor/indoor chic atmosphere.  Food and wine were excellent as expected! What another great addition to the Postino family! Loved it!!!!!
5,"twas the night before booyah and all the through the city people were piecing  some pretty shitty costumes together at savers, good will george w bush clintons, bill and hill jay-z & beyonce biden and obama even saw kanye oprah, super mamma yep, octomom brad pitt & jolie and men as madonna and lynn sue cooney  i went to Easleys to see what they had of course, it was madness every kid, mom and dad crammed into the isles pulling on wigs vampire masks and noises of pigs all being assisted  by the yellow teed staff so very helpful no panic, just laughs ""yes we have liberace in fact, we have two try both of them on ill grab em for you"" they found me a boa a wig and make up took just fifteen minutes case opened and shut and all around me this repeated itself the people rolled in pleased people rolled out into the darkness parties around town wonder how many were out gettin down in get ups from Easleys im guessing a ton so check out Bert Easleys make up, magic, fun bright yellow building south side of mcdowell since nineteen sixty four makin halloween, howl"
5,"The sushi was fresh and excellent! The service was almost too fast. I did not find the prices to be out of line with the quality.  Our daughter loved the miso soup. The one thing I really appreciated is that they will make what you want, whether it is on the menu or not. If they have it, you can get it. I know well be going there often.  One thing though, this is a busy, noisy place. It is not large either. If you are looking for quite and relaxed, this perhaps isnt the best choice. If you want good food in a noisy cheerful atmosphere, like a bunch of friends or after work, this fits the bill."
4,"Icey iced ice... tasty and refreshing, Ritas delivers.  You cant help but smile as you walk in the door, anticipating the tasty goodness that is lined up in front of you.  They have simple cream ice, milkshakes, gelati, Italian ices, frozen custard, frozen custard cookies... and on and on.  We stopped by on a random, warm afternoon after passing the new store and noticing the sign... a few samples later, we were sure that wed found a winner.  My only ouch came when I found out the calories and fat in my Blendini mix.  :-/  Glad I shared it!  Well just make Ritas an occasional splurge. Yum... Blendini!  We recommend the Vanilla custard with Toffee. :-D   See ya there!"
4,Never had a bad meal or a bad beer here.  Great selection of brews and the food that they make is simple and GOOD.  Great recipe for success.  Service is a little spotty but expected due to the fact that these are college students who really (speculating here and actually giving the benefit of the doubt) dont care too much about customer service - its just a job to them.
