4,"Whos got the munchies!!!!! Friday and Saturday nights till 3 am, Mrs. Whites is servin up some yummy munchies including Fried Zucchini around $3 and entrees for $13.  I had to have their fried chicken , pork chop and some gravy and rice at 12am! The fried chicken was cooked perfectly.  The skin is crispy and tasty.  The meat moist and tasty.  The portions are huge and you will not go home hungry.  The staff is friendly and helpful; always a pleasure to talk to them.  Skip Filibertos or Jack n Box after the party..movie..concert..and go to Mrs. Whites!"
5,"I have found my new favorite sushi spot. I wish it was closer to Tempe, but its worth the drive. You can tell by their menu that Hana strives to be an authentic Japanese restaurant, as opposed to the sake bomber joint that only has food so they can call themselves a restaurant. You know the kind; the Phoenix area is plagued with them. Hana is BYOB, and there are only a few ridiculous fusion rolls on their sushi menu: most of it is authentic, real sushi.  On my first visit I started with my usual appetizers, and was immediately struck by how unusually fresh and tasty they were. The seaweed salad had just the right amount of sesame oil, giving it incredible flavor. The veggie gyoza were indescribably delicious. They made me realize Id never had a fresh gyoza before; every one Id eaten previously in my life was a pale imitation of these little bits of Heaven. The sushi came out fast, even though it was fairly busy this particular Thursday. The first thing I noticed, naturally, was that someone put a burning sugar cube on the tray. ""Hey, fire!"" I thought. It was a nice touch. Then I saw, nestled between the flaming sugar and the wad of wasabe, a small pile of what looked like pickle relish. I guessed what it was, and our waitress confirmed it: it was FRESH wasabe. Real, fresh-grated wasabe is something most people never experience. Most people dont even know the pasty green stuff thats standard in every sushi restaurant is just normal horseradish dyed green. The real stuff is just too expensive, and too difficult to keep on hand. But there it was, no extra charge. It adds a little spice and a wonderful, fruity complexity to the sushi.  The sushi was great. They also have a large menu with all the other Japanese dishes youd expect, but I didnt try any of them. Next time."
5,I went here for my birthday this year. The best part was my friends picked up the tab:) The food was fantastic. When I found out from a friend who works here that the same chef who created the city hall menu is the executive chef at ocean club I knew getting a steak to compliment my fish was the right choice. The only down side was that everyone who went out that night were so full that we decided that it was a better idea to go home ad sleep than hit the clubs.....well maybe that wasnt a bad thing after all.
4,"Good tattoo shop. Clean space, multiple artists to choose from and books of their work are available for you to look though and decide whos style most mirrors what youre looking for. I chose Jet to do a cover-up for me and he worked with me on the design and our ideas and communication flowed very well. Hes a very personable guy, is friendly and keeps the conversation going while hes working on you, and he doesnt dick around (read: He starts to work and continues until the job is done). Hes very professional and informative. Good customer service combines with talent at the craft."
4,"My husband and I lucked into one of the best dining experiences in a long time on a recent business trip to AZ. The hummous appetizer was exceptional, as was the ""whats in this steak?"" dish, tender filet wrapped in yukon-gold potatoes (how comforting is THAT?). Nice selection of wine by the glass.  The only disappointment was a dessert referred to as a ""twist on Tiramisu,"" but which bore no resemblance to it at all, with toffee cookie dough ice cream. Ill go back next time in town, but try a different dessert."
2,"For what it is, cheap easy family friendly food with a bit of a yuppie bend, its not bad. But they messed up a grilled cheese sandwich. How do you do that? My mom, god bless her, cant cook to save her life. None the less, she can still make a pretty damn good grilled cheese. Its not rocket science. Let me walk Sauce through this: - Cut slices of cheese. Precut is pretty gross. - Put bread around cheese. - Apply butter to the outside. - Grill til melted. Yet, my girlfriends grilled cheese was horrible. Bad bread, thin on the cheese, and it tasted like heated cat turds. Im just not that impressed. I know lots of you love this place, but I dont for the life of me know why. It would have been 1 star, but the mac n cheese bought it an extra star.  Why is it so hard to find good pizza in Phoenix. Youd think with its mob proximity to Las Vegas that itd have better Italian food. And yet, not so much. I blame the Mormon influence on this town. Too many years of Kraft products and special underwear have really killed the food talent here."
2,"id rather go to amados! the only thing thats good here is the bean dip, and im only saying that so that i have something nice to say."
4,Great food. Service consistently blows. Sit at the bar and you will be fine.
5,Perfect place for a hot summer day.  Amazing paletas!  Friendly staff and fresh ingredients.  Welcoming environment in downtown Chandler.
4,"A bit pricey, yet one of the best breakfast sandwiches you will find.  Parking is slim."
5,"What a cool little place tucked away behind a strip mall.  Would never have found this if it was not suggested by a good friend who raved about the cappuccino!  He is world traveler, so, its a  must try if its the best cup hes ever had.  He was right!  Dont know if its in the beans or the care that they take to make it with a fab froth decoration on top.  My hubby and I loved the caramel brulee taste..  My son loved the hot ""warm"" cocoa.  Yeah, we walked in as a family last night and almost everyone turned our way since we did not fit the hip college crowd.  Everyone was really friendly, though. The sweet young man behind the counter gave my son some micro cinnamon doughnuts and scored major points with the little dude!   We will be back."
2,"Thai??? Really?? I love Thai food and couldnt be happier to try a new restaurant. Wow! It was a slap in the face on so many levels. The 2 hostesses were the rudest I have had the displeasure of having to interact with. We ordered take out and as we waited for out food from the kitchen the hostesses made us uncomfortable... As if we were imposing on there entry. The food was not spectacular. We ordered pad Thai , was very dry but not horrible. The sweet or sour beef was watery and seemed more like fajita with way too many peppers. No  sticky rice, green papaya salad, Larb..."
5,"I used Harvils Auto Body after a fender bender. They were one of the auto body places that was included in State Farms program. They were efficient, friendly, proactive, highly-responsive, and helpful. I especially appreciated that they kept me updated on the progress of my automobile and advocated for me/my vehicle when needed. This level of high-quality customer services is hard to come by. If you have a choice, choose Harvils. You wont be disappointed."
5,"I love love LOVE this place. My boss (who is into healthy eating) recommended this place. I went over with some highly skeptical friends and one dinner was enough to convert them into believers! The food here is so good! We had the Shrimp dumplings and the Onion tart as starters. We ordered the Shirataki noodles and street tacos as entrees. So also ordered the Kale-aid. All of the dishes were yummy.  I have gone back many times since then and have never been disappointed! I have gone after yoga to get some Kale salad or the chicken chopped salad. I always have to get the Kale aid.  Once, a guy at the next table, uprooted a whole plant by mistake (on the patio) and was highly embarrassed as was his date! Ever since, I have very careful not to throw my arms around as I can be quite clumsy sometimes! I do NOT want to be banned from my favorite place for my clumsiness! I dont think I can live without True Food!"
4,"My sister and I went today for brow waxes. The establishment is spotless. Cleanliness is really important to me. My esthetician was Alexandra. She was very professional and explained everything she did before she did it. Ive had many waxes and know the procedure, but it was a nice touch.  When we arrived for our appointments we were told about their package prices. Im a pay-as-you-go type person so I declined. It was not a hard sell and I really appreciated that. I made a follow up appointment in 2 weeks."
5,Great happy hour specials.  All the appetizers are delicious!  Service is first rate and its nice to sit outside on the patio.  Great people watching without being too obnoxious!  LOL
4,"BEST CARNE ASADA (GRILLED SLICED STEAK), HACIENDA-STYLE HOSPITALITY. A MEXICAN FOOD EXPERIENCE IN THE THEME-PARK STYLE. --colorful, tasteful, vibrant ambiance in the country-hacienda style; kudos to the designers with an eye for detail; --dining room draws natural light from the delightful patio windows to the vaulted ceilings above; --this place and the adjacent ranch market are a ""must-do"" for tourists (bring your out-of-towners here); --Dont miss the Parrilla (grilled platter); one ""portion"" serves two; choose three meats and voice your tortilla preference; --grilled vegetables include nopales (cactus), Mexican zucchini squash, jalapenos (consumed whole, took me to five hiccups before my stomach settled), and baby onion stalks (not the typical pile-o-fajita yellows); --both rice and beans served family style, and perfectly flavored. I could just sit and eat bowl after bowl of those beans; --juicy, perfectly cooked shrimp; ""asada"" goodness knows no bounds; --guacamole is plentiful (no melon-ball scoops of yesterday at $3/ea here!) and freshly made to order; NOW THATS what Im TALKing about !!! --table salsa is spicy with lots of freshly chopped chilis and pureed onions; really good burn; --try the horchata (rice milk and cinnamon sugary goodness) or any of the featured Aguas Frescas. --no fuss over separate checks (and that was for our table of 10!) --pork was a bit dry; is ""gamey"" possible in pork? --server forgot our desserts and we gave up after 20 minutes (shucks! they were sitting right there on the pass!); the manager refunded us promptly and then packaged them to-go. After so many recent disappointments on rock-hard rubbery shrimp, I _finally_ found a place that grills properly, excellent marinade, and with the freshest ingredients. If you get the impression that you are amidst a food operation staffed by thousands, you are correct: several hundred are working in the kitchens next door making tortillas, cheese, asada, aguas and more! If you dont have a filthy-rich Mexican relative with a hacienda (Mexican mansion) across the border, this may be the closest youll get without an invitation. The mostly-abandoned courtyard is centered with a gigantic fountain, lined with what could be booths for a seasonal market, bodas, or other festival. In the corner a lush garden with a somewhat secret door leading to la sala, the grand room. Dont miss the Ranch Market next door; you wont see retail food sold in this quantity anywhere else in town. Take your camera."
1,"The 3 employees were so busy talking to each other they couldnt remember what we ordered, kept having to ask, and still didnt get it right.  In the midst of the three employees continuing in their personal chaos, my husband finally said, ""ok, time out! Im the customer.  Make our sandwiches and then take care of your issues."". They stopped for a split second, all three looked at us, then they actually IGNORED us, finished their conversation, then finished our sandwiches.  We were the only ones in there and we really were shocked!  Good thing I like avacado, because it ended up on my sandwich & I didnt order it, and after telling the girl, she said, ""I thought you said..."". Still had the order wrong!  Whew!"
1,Very bad food!
2,"I wasnt that impressed.  The machines look old and rusted, there didnt seem to be any air-conditioning and it had to be in the 90s inside since it was about 110 outside.  They did have overhead fans.  The price was cheap--45 cents per load to wash in a top loader but we only found one top-loader available that actually worked.  Half of them were Out Of Order.  Instead we dumped everything into two front loaders that claimed to do double loads and were out of there in pretty short order.  We took the clothes back to my daughters apartment building to dry in the laundry room there so she didnt have to stay with them."
5,"Restaurant 28 is a solid hole-in-the-wall thats pretty easy to miss, but its definitely worth a stop.  On my visits Ive gotten brisket and other barbecue, and my friends swear by the chicken and say its some of their favorite chicken in the Valley.  The hush puppies are great- the greens are good too. Another review said it well when they said this place doesnt underseason food.  Every time Ive gone it hasnt been bland- its got some great flavor and its tasty stuff. Its in a pretty dull area where there isnt much else to do, or Id be out there more often.  Its a tiny place too but Ive never been in and had it be hugely busy or busy to the point that waiting was crazy. Definitely recommended, and I hope theyre able to grow and thrive."
3,"For quick fast food.. this is my choice.. I usually call ahead and get take out.. Dont expect super friendly.. but its just take out.. not clear table service.. even if you stay.. I always get the chicken salad with sesame vinagrette on the side but I will say, Im not a fan of the pungent dressing.. I get the chile sauce instead.. vietnamese rolls.. and its not so unhealthy.. NOW my friends that usually nosh with me.. hate the foods they get.. they say it every time I suggest this place.. who knows? Since I  havent really tried anything from my norm salad.. I cant say.. but for me its a strong 3.."
4,"I am a huge fan of the Italian beef and of course everyone is going to have their favorite places and tastes. But this seemed like a place to satisfy a lot of different tastes. There are several sizes, extra meat is available and if you are getting it to go, Id say go for it! Only order it regular if you are a fan of super dry sandwiches. Id say go for wet if you are like lightly moist but if you are a big au ju fan like I am, definitely hook it up with the dipped!! They have american, cheddar and provolone cheese (pretty sad they didnt have the mozzarella). They giardiniera was pretty good as were the sweet peppers. It wasnt too greasy or hard to eat while driving. They did have a variety of other things to eat so definitely check those out if you arent up for a beef...but thats what they are known for!!"
5,"Not exactly what I expected ..................I liked it.  I was thinking some sprawling ranch house with wood floors and saw dust everywhere, maybe some old west artifacts on the walls and grumpy old waitresses.  What I got was a cool little funky building, with cool interior and neat things on the walls. More of a sports bar atmosphere with a good sized dining area. Killer staff and great food.  I had a burger, I believe flat grilled, cooked medium rare and I could tell it was good beef. They said they grind it themselves. The fries were great as they are a fresh cut type. The beans were different. They were a lighter vinegary type of bean with onion and bacon. I liked them but could not eat the whole pot that came out.  It ended up being a little expensive. 9 for the burger and Fries, 2.50 for the drink and 1.50 for the beans. Tax and tip it was an 18 dollar lunch."
2,"We tried this out last night. We wont be back.  There is no indication when you walk in that its a seat-yourself restaurant. We stood like idiots at the hostess area until somone asked us if we needed something.  We sat ourselves, and then sat and sat and sat because there was no server assigned to us. Perhaps that is a reason to seat patrons, so a server knows theyve arrived? Finally, the hostess asked us if anyone had helped us, and she was very polite and took our order.  Our drinks came out fairly quickly, but then we waited and waited for our food. This would have been understandable if the placed had been packed, but it wasnt. It was maybe 75% full (7:30 on Saturday) and there seemed to be plenty of servers. There was one large party on the patio. I ordered the vegetarian salad (cant remember what it was called) that advertised avocado, jicama, beans, and other yummy things. When it arrived, there was a tiny little mushy sliver of avocado perched on top, and no more to be found. It was as if someone scraped up the dregs of an avocado from the rind of an empty one and flung it on my salad. It would have been more forgiveable if they had just forgotten it altogether. Also, the white beans were undercooked.  The pizzas were good. I ordered the local organic vegetable one without cheese, and it came loaded with summer squash, roasted carrots, olives (local? Hmm...), leeks, roasted onions, and the crust was thin and crispy. My husband also enjoyed his pizza.  I should actually grant an additional half star to the hostess/waitress, who comped my salad when I complained about it. I was willing to pay for it, but she offered to take it off the bill.  The final nail in the coffin was perhaps not the fault of the restaurant, but the large party out on the patio had 3-4 elementary-age kids literally running laps through the restaurant for the first 15-20 minutes we were there. If ignorant parents are content to let their hellions ruin other diners experiences, then Im afraid its left to the restaruant to politely and discreetely ask the parents to please reign them in. No such luck.  Anyway, this place has some things to work on. Fortunately for us, there are too many other great businesses nearby for us to give it a second chance."
5,This place is awesome. Just bought a loose super powers darkseid. Will def be back for more. Lots of loose figures. Great prices and friendly staff.
5,"This place has been here 7 years and we have never been. Are you kidding me? The food is excellent. The people who work here are friendly and seem to be happy to be there, which is most important. I tried the make your own half salad and half sandwich. YUMMY!!! There are many choices for salad toppings. There us nothing I like more than a huge, fresh salad. I chose to top my salad with avocado, tomato, bacon, edemame, feta cheese, and whipped balsamic vinaigrette. I really think this was the best salad I have ever had! They make the salad in front of you and mix in the perfect amount of dressing. I chose the chicken pesto sandwich. The combo of these items was a perfect portion for this hungry girl. The sandwich was excellent. My hubby ordered the Cuban pork sandwich. This is one huge sandwich! It was difficult to get his mouth around it, but once he did, it was awesome!! Typically, we dont like coleslaw, but it was really good, especially combined with the tender pork. We will return to the Market Bistro, again and again.  Loved it!!!!"
4,"So we decided to come back and give this place another  try and it was  a lot better than our first experience!  We had the fondue first, which was more than enough for 2 people to share.  I had the chicago dog, again and my bf had a hamburger.  The service was awesome and our waitress made sure we had more than enough wine!  Looks like Windsor has been ironing out their kinks and really making it into a cool, fun space to hang out and eat!"
5,Tuck Shop is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Phx. Everything is superb from the service to drinks to food to overall experience. Definitely go soon!
5,"This is my favorite spot, waterfalls everywhere, beautiful flowers, fun slide, and great food!"
4,"Im glad I made a second trip to Papago before writing a review, because they have redeemed themselves from my original visit. The problem with my first visit was two-fold: 1) The beers that were most interesting to me had run dry; 2) The food I ordered was pretty hard to grunt down. And although I sat at the bar with my compadre and tried to make conversation with the bartender about the different beers offered, it was fairly one-sided. I did not get a dose of craft beer expertise from what is arguably a brewpub that showcases a true love for beer. So regardless of the less-than-stellar first visit, I still was impressed with the selection of draft beer especially the regional offerings. The built-in beer coolers are also a testament to a great place to sample different labels. The one thing I must caution others against is the food. The steak sandwich I ordered (with special gardiniera) was pretty lousy. The beef had a precooked-then frozen-then reheated quality. The gardiniera was essentially all jalapeños and too fiery to eat... I had to scrape a fair amount of them off to make it edible. I had a good time drinking some decent beers with my friend, but we both regretted our food choice. My return visit restored my faith. The beer list was current and updated. There was a large variety of new draft beers to choose from, and my group ordered two pizzas. This place has delicious pizza! Our waiter was especially knowledgeable about the beers being offered and was able to help us choose especially interesting ones. I like the atmosphere and crowd at Papago and intend to return. But I will definitely stick to the pizza."
4,Weve eaten at this location quite a few times. Weve always enjoyed it. The pizza is great and the employees are friendly. We also threw my sons 6th birthday party here in sept. Our hostess assigned to our party was great and very patient with all the kids.  My son said it was the best party ever. Well definately be having more parties here!
4,"I went here with my mom while my dad had a dinner meeting. The atmosphere is hip but its also got a mature setting. It is a really great place for young adults and even older ones. The price was good, the food was amazing! The portions were also big and MOST the staff was friendly. I overheard two rude staff members making fun of the customers. However they might not even work there anymore. Great place!"
3,"Typical unpretentious dive bar where you can meet a friend after work, play pool, watch sports, whatever...  Theres a pretty big food menu too.  I had the nachos once and they were quite filling and tasty.  Nice happy hour specials also.  I heard it was a place to watch Ohio State sports but it was pretty dead when I went there to watch a football game.  However, it was kind of nice getting a prime spot in front of a huge tv and the service was really good."
5,"I booked our anniversary trip to the Westin Kierland through Priceline.  It was so reasonably priced that I was a bit concerned it would lack quality, and after reading a few reviews on Trip Advisor I was worried.  I was COMPLETELY wrong.  This is a 5 star resort from the moment you park your car.  The front desk staff upgraded our room, and this very nice gentleman greeted us with a smile every single time we passed through the lobby.  They have golf carts available to drive you to your rental car.  The food in Deseo is amazing.  I would definitely recommend trying the ceviche sampler and the muddled cocktails.  I cant forget to mention the amazing bread made with tapioca flour, they will even give you the recipe.  We especially enjoyed talking to the girls in the information center (the one that looks like a mine).  They were VERY helpful in giving us advice on local restaurants and insisting we take a day trip to Sedona......we did and Sedona is now one of our favorite cities. Thanks to Ashley, Miranda, Tiffany, Chelsea, and Pat.  When we returned from our Sedona day trip, we had chips & salsa, and two cold coronas.  This was a very thoughtful touch. If you are looking for a fine dining experience, Mastros Ocean Club is right across the street and has incredible food.  I highly recommend the lobster mashed potatoes and the seared scallops.   Back to the resort.......our room had a great view of the golf course which was massive.  Although we are not golfers, we certainly enjoyed the view.  Our room was a pretty good size and the Heavenly Beds are my absolute favorite.  When traveling I will do my very best to ensure we stay at a Westin Resort."
4,"oooooooooh man am I SO GLAD this place isnt near my house, I would gain 20 pounds in no time!  My sister took me here for the first time a couple weeks ago and my mind was blown by all the unique flavors they served!  The shop itself is very cute and modern. I like that they have a section in the back with a bunch of board games, very cool.  As for the ice cream I got the dutch chocolate and the horchata. The horchata was so so good, I cant stop thinking about it!  The following week I took the husband there. Again the ice cream was very good but the service was terrible. It was an older lady behind the counter and she really couldnt care less that we were standing there. She let me sample an ice cream and then I just stood there for a good 5 minutes while she did other things behind the counter. We did finally get served but my husband wasnt impressed with the serves one bit. This time I got my ice cream in a waffle cone, the cone was so light and airy, I loved it!"
5,"The bar and wait staff couldnt be better at this location of PF Changs.  The food and service is better than any other Changs country-wide.  We just moved here from NY and missed our ""local hangout"".  The bar tenders and wait staff have made us feel at home.  We go at least once per week for wonder food, drink, and company with the staff and other patrons.  Thank you Clint, Gerry, Nate, Kyle, Nick, Angie, et al."
5,"My boyfriend and I stopped by to grab a bite to eat before work and long story short -Greeted immediately  -Lots of variety -Meat lovers pizza is amazing -Ask for Tawnya shes really nice and a wonderful server  -Will be back, loved the excellent service!!"
4,"One of the best lunches Ive had in Phoenix. Im still thinking about the fried egg sandwich and fries. A fried egg- yolk just barely runny. Barely. Two thick-ass slabs of good-ass, smoky-ass bacon. Arugula and aioli on a really tasty ass bun. Damn, son. Good as hell. The french fries were so damn good, too, and you have to dip those in the remoulade to really enjoy them all the way.  I would come back for this sammich every day if I lived next door. Dont be afraid of it being called a fried egg sammich, because its a whole nother level."
4,"This Target gets the job done. Their shelves tend to be in a little disarray, and their makeup selections are generally lacking, but other than superfluous purchases I didnt even need to make, this Target has never let me down. The grocery section is probably the cleanest and best in the store. I love perusing these aisles. Their clothing section is pretty diverse, but because the store is somewhat small, its packed in tight. Its a challenge to maneuver the area. The biggest perk is its central location to southern Tempe. Its also very rarely busy during the day, which is awesome!"
4,"So it was my second time when I actually enjoyed what I was eating because we actually knew what we were ordering.  And the broth was a lot better than the first time.  The first my friends and I ate at Tien Wong, we had ordered the Ying-Yang pot, which had the spicy and mild on each side, it was okay.  This time, we ordered the Lemon Grass one. Which I highly recommend!!! It was so much better than the Ying-Yang.   NEVER NEVER NEVER get the quail eggs.  It was a waste of money.  and make sure to get lots and lots of beef slices.  Thats like my favorite part of eating hot pot.  I like eating the clear Asian noodles one the most...it doesnt make the broth all thick after putting the noodles intot he broth like the udon noodles.   I also really like the fact that theyre open really late.  Midnight snack!!"
5,"Im giving this Office Max five stars for convenience, friendly service, competitively priced products a stocked shelves.  This Office Max is a great in and out shop. On one side there is the detailed supply store and on the office side, there is a complete copy center. Its open until 9 on the weekdays and they dont make you feel rushed if you get there at oh lets say...8:50. In fact, they are helpful! They walked me around and helped me find the random items I needed. The copy center staff was also very friendly.  This Office Max has your complete supply of office items but their prices are very reasonable! I purchased the same item at another shop that I did here and it was significantly less expensive here.  So on that note, I end my review on Office Max but I will report back with any new findings."
5,Ive been coming here since the 70s when it was across the street and had a screen door. I know the staff and the daily specials by heart.  When I lived away from PHX it was the place I wished for. When I go to NYC I have to take RM food to my friends. The whole family agrees. I dont understand the negative reviews. The reviewers must have had a bad day. I love the food and so has everyone  I know.
5,Nice Plaza.  Very well located.  Clean store.  Friendly staff.   All you could want
5,"Oh AJs...  How do I love thee...  Let me count the ways (BEERS)... 1...2...3...200! They have so many different beers to choose from here.  If you ever need an ingredient that is out of the norm they will have it.  If you ever need an ingredient for a special dinner that MUST be fresh and ripe, this is the place. From 10 differnt types of flower, 15 different brands of pasta, to 20 different types of EVOO, if youre making a really great dinner, spend the extra couple of bucks and get your stuff here. One day Ill be able to afford the prime steaks."
4,"Excellent Excellent Excellent...  My wife and I try to eat here at least 3 -4 times a month.  Owners are very nice to chat with.  We planned a trip to Thailand this fall, and the owners help tell us where to go and what to see."
4,"A definite favorite in the neighborhood. The happy hour menu is always interesting and good. In several visits Ive never had anything that wasnt delicious, and the beers on special are uniformly impressive."
2,The only thing I like about Fez are the pomegranate margaritas.  Food could be better...
5,"we went back here again this past weekend...actually we went there 3 more times this past weekend alone!  we couldnt resist the awesome service and great prices...and great live music.  this is definately going to be one of our ""regular joints.""  if you like the country...country girls....and good old rowdy shit..then stop by and check it out for yourself.  i bet you will like this place.   there is a large dance floor for some shit kickin ...about 3 pool tables..big buck hunter and an outdoor area for smokin and boozin and dart throwin.  i love this place.  this is what toby keith should have been singing about...seriously!"
4,"If you need a hat, this is where to go."
5,"One of my fave places in Phoenix. Well stocked and friendly staff. I dont normally peruse the DVDs or CDs because they tend to be pricey,but one day I just decided to take a look. Thats when Borders became one of my fave places. I was able to find a fairly rare documentary DVD. I paid 40 bucks for it,but have never seen it offered for sale anywhere before. I very much appreciate a business who refuses to cowtow to the ridiculousness of political correctness. For that alone was well worth paying 40 bucks for. I was even more impressed by the staffer who rang up my purchase for not only being knowledgable about the DVD but letting me know they had a biography of the director of the film that had just come in. Even though the shipment had not been tagged and put on the floor for sale yet,the staffer called to have someone open the box,and bring a copy for me to look at. I bought that too! I will coninue to patronize Borders and any other book store that chooses not to censor!"
3,"The Service is great.  The food is ok.  The salsa.....horrible.  Please rethink your salsa.  Oh, and if you order a side of jalapenos they charge $1.99.  I have never heard of a Mexican restaurant charging for jalapenos.  Overall, just an ok place.  There are better options on and around Mill."
5,"This is a great place in an extremity of the Valley. They serve both Korean and Japanese food. They are quick and attentive. Having lived in South Korea for two years, I can honestly admit that this is some of the most authentic Korean cuisine Ive had in Phoenix. I typically ate bibimbap once a week minimum over there and I cant really tell the difference between Takamatsus version and the stuff I had on the other side of the Pacific. I noticed they offer a list of other, more obscure foods I learned to love over there, including naengmyeon (cold, spicy noodles), japchae (stir-fried glass noodles), and several other dishes. They also follow tradition and bring you several side dishes. Love it or hate it, kimchi accompanies every meal, as do spicy bean sprouts, a tangy spinach dish and a few other random sides. Its a little bit more expensive than average restaurant prices in the Valley, but definitely worth it when you consider the sides that come with it, and a complimentary spiced tea for ""dessert."""
5,"I love this place. It is one of my favorite Antique shops in the city! There is a wide selection and variety of booths and items. There is everything here from match boxes, cute purses and hats to retro/vintage furniture, wacky mannequins, old cameras and old toys to reminiscence over. And! They are decently priced and have a nice helpful staff."
2,"Ill agree that this is a great meet up place in the city. Nice neighborhood, adequate parking in the structure behind, and a greta atmosphere with great service. The menu is interesting and Id come back to try more but heres what our first visit was like. As a Starter we had the Spinach Quesadilla made with Lavosh and it was great. I mean really great and enough as a meal for two. For that alone Id go back. My better half had the Falafel Pita and thought it was OK.  I had the Gyros Pita and got luncheon meat. Im talking precisely sliced, straight from the fridge but thrown on the grill to warm-up luncheon meat. If you go online to see the menu, its one of the items you can click for a nutrition chart. Heres what it reads for the ""meat"" Gyro Beef [Beef, Lamb, Water, Bread Crumbs (Bleached Wheat Flour, Water, Dextrose,Salt and Yeast may contain soy bean oil, Calcium Propionate), Soy Protein Concentrate, Less thean 2% Salt, Garlic and Onion Powder, Monosodium Glutamate, ]; So, the takeaway here is stay away from the Gyro.  But, Hey!  Gyro IS a pita. I expected a reasonable execution. Heck, make a Gyro meatloaf and slice it up at least.  Yes, Im bitter."
4,"I stopped by early this morning to satisfy my crave for something new. The place is very clean and a man came out to greet me and was ready to serve. He clearly explained every item I was curious about since the labels were in Spanish. I asked if his name was Miguel and he said yes. I told him I read about his bakery on Yelp. Then he said that he loves Yelp and thats how word is going around now for him and he also uses to find reviews on other places. He was very friendly and had lots of patience. I was the only customer at the time and he actually doesnt mind having a conversation unlike open ended talks with others. I ended up buying 10 pastries and it cost $6.80. What a great deal! They also sell other items such as tamales, burritos, and menudo. I inquired about the burritos cuz I like mine with a little kick,but unfortunately they werent ready yet. He showed me the homemade tortillas and he says he used them on the burritos. He said they dont look big, but he assured that the burritos are filled with red (mild) or green (with a kick) chili, shredded pork, and some potatoes. He said that one burrito is good to fill up a person. So...I must come back and try it.  So far Ive had the flaky pastry with the shredded coconut and Bavarian cream...the Bavarian wasnt as creamy than Im used to. I almost thought it would have been better off to not have it, but its a nice added flavor when you eat it all together rather than just tasting the Bavarian on its on.  I had that curvy, pretty looking pastry which is topped with crystal sugars and with all the sugar on top, I thought it might be too sweet, but nope. It was just fine with the pineapple filling (excuse me as I wipe my drool).  Then it was off to have the caramel flautas dusted with powdered sugar. The first bite was eh. The second bite was...um. Third bite, WOW! I finally reached the part that had more caramel in it and I LOVE IT!!! Did I mention that Im not a big fan of caramel? This caramel is sweet and creamy. Its just so good! A definitely must have for next time. Thats about as much my tummy let me eat for today. Im sure the rest will be just as good and I cant wait till tomorrow morning to try to rest of my goodies."
4,The food is always awesome.  Best in the area.    The people behind the counter need to pull their heads out of their asses.  Dont be rude to me if I ask for an extra bag to carry my food.  Id be happy to let the food drop to the floor for you to clean up.
3,"A nice place to shop, but I wouldnt want to live there.  I never used to be a department store shopper, but recently Ive discovered that nicer cloths just seem to fit better. Go figure. While I still like getting a deal, I usually wait until there is a clearance or sale or some type. The macys at scottsdale fashion square seems to have more selection, such as more size options for the items you seem to like and a few more items to choose from also. For guys, I would suggest checking out the Dillards at fashion square; the mens dept is about the size of this entire macys store. 2 or 3 times a year dillards has an awesome clearance event and you can pickup 65% off clearance prices; which are usually already 50 - 70% off the original price. I digress; this is supposed to be a review of macys. If youre in the biltmore area and looking for higher end quality shopping go ahead and check them out, then travel down camelback to fashion square mall when they tell you the item you like is only available in your size at a different store."
3,"In the office, Fiesta Burrito is aptly known as ""across the street.""  Kind of like, ""How about across the street?""  ""Yeah, I could do across the street, today.""  If I ever said, ""How about Fiesta Burrito?""  I would get, ""Wheres that?""  Then I would have to say, ""You know, across the street.""  And the response would be, ""Well, why didnt you say so in the first place."" The primary reason we eat at ""across the street"" is because it is convenient - its across the street.  And in the immortal words of my most quotable co-worker, ""It is fast, cheap, and good -- no questions asked.""  The part about it being good is debatable.  I could do with a little less greasy.  Fast, no question.  And despite that fact that ""across the street"" charges 60 cents for spicy carrots now, the prices are low.  I like the chorizo plate with a side of sour cream, although I might start branching out as we eat at ""across the street"" way too much, and Im getting tired of always having the same thing. At just above a dive, I would call it a hole in the wall, but really, it is just a generic Mexican joint that hides in plain sight.  Even the name is rather plain as no one can seem to remember it.  There is a smallish, generic inside dining area, which is accompanied by a small, generic patio for outside dining.  Some high school students seem to come by for lunch leave.  The staff is polite.  Until they move or I no longer work across the street, Ill be a regular."
3,"I recently attended a conference in AZ and stayed at the Squaw Peak. The grounds were very nice, and with all the on-site activities this hotel would be quite a draw for the kids.  Being I dont have any kids, plus it was too cold to be out by the pool, activities on site were pretty limited. The gym facilities and the comfort of the bed made up for the lack of adult festivities. The gym was good sized and had ample new equipment. The bed was really comfortable and had great pillows.  Great for a family vacation, A-Ok for the business traveler."
4,"I have been searching for a good Pho restaurant ever since Saigon Pho in Chandler went down hill.  Pho Van is a very clean, well organized, and well staffed restaurant in the Asian Center that shares space with Lee Lees and other shops.   I had the traditional Pho Ga (chicken soup in beef broth) and Goi Cuon (Spring rolls).  Both were very good.  The noodles in the broth were perfectly cooked and had great texture and the chicken was all white meat and very tender.  The veggies that accompany the pho were fresh and crisp.  The Spring Rolls were perfect as well stuff full of healthy green veggies.   The prices were a little higher than I am used to in a pho place but it was not bad.  They also do not accept AMEX so beware if that is all you use.   Overall a great place and this is my new Go-To-Pho in the valley."
4,Lash Extensions by Cher here are AMAZING  _Affordable.  _She listens to your every wish for the final product.  _Very friendly.  _Accommodating evening appointments.  _Reasonable amount of time to complete.  _She is pretty busy so make appt in advance.  I wouldnt go anywhere but here for lash extensions!  Cher is the greatest =)  aaand no I am absolutely NOT Cher haha just one of her very satisfied customers.
4,Where else can you get a Chile Relleno wrapped in a tortilla to make a burrito? Super crunchy friend goodness with oozy melty cheese in every bite.. Oh the overkill and love every second of it!! Jen Red Pork in a quesadilla with a side of black beans and jerk fried rice.. this is some serious hybrid comfort food.. may sound strange but works very well! Youll leave super stuffed and change in your wallet from a $10!
3,Not a bad place.  Pizza was good but stay away from the wraps as the flatbread wasnt meant for that.
3,"Ive actually never set foot inside this restaurant, so I cant comment on the place itself. But every now and then weve picked up orders from Old Spaghetti Factory at work, so I can comment on the food itself.  The food is as basic as it gets. This is definitely ""family food."" Most adults wont complain about it, and kids will enjoy the simplicity. I recently had the Old Spaghetti Factorys Chicken Parm. I wont call it bland, but its nothing that the average home chef couldnt cook up for their family.  I will give the place credit for the portions. Its not expensive and you get a lot of food. While the chicken itself was not huge, it comes with Spaghetti, an entire loaf of bread and butter, and a side salad. The salad was way too plain for my taste, but at least I had a little bit of vegetables to go with my meal. Its also quick. Take out orders are almost always said to be ready within 10 to 15 minutes."
4,I love this place. The service is absolutely amazing. They are always really friendly and never screw up my order - - things that are very important when it comes to fast food. Their Apple Walnut Chicken salad is amazing! I also crave their fried zucchini on a steady basis. Carls Jr has some of the best fast food burgers out there... if you want something fast and GOOD then I think you should stop here.
3,"Great ice cream, but still just ice cream. Really enjoyed the salted caramel alongside a scoop of sweet corn. Feel a little silly for driving from Phoenix just for the taste but no complaints."
4,"Great new addition to Mill Ave.  First stopped by here for a Monday Happy Hour, and instantly loved it. This is a perfect day-drinking place when the weather is nice, and they do a good job of creating a large indoor / outdoor space with plenty of patio. Happy Hour is pretty great - 1/2 off almost all beers. (they do well drink / wine specials too, but dont remember what they were. I think it was $1 off... but dont quote me on that.) Bottom line, I had 3 Firestone DBAs, and i think my bill was about 8 bucks before tip. Score. (normal beer prices are in the $5-6 range. A vodka gimlet not on happy hour (well vodka) cost me $4, which is right where it should be.) Also made a return trip on a Saturday night, to get a feel for the weekend crowd. Not too bad, but mildly disappointed. I was hoping it would remain a little more of the chill day-time vibe, but come 10pm the music gets cranked up, and my group decided to move on to a place where we could actually have conversation without screaming.  (sidenote: every bartender / waitress Ive dealt with here has been really, super nice.) Def. worth a shot Id say, and I could see it being a fave HH place."
4,"Ive been coming here for 10 years and still love it. The bbq beans are really good. My favorite thing to get here is a jumbo baker (and they mean jumbo) with everything on it including a side of chopped beef and then I add their homemade bbq sauce to it. Sooooo good. Their homemade root beer and limeade are also yummy. I remember them having a customer appreciation day once a year (I think in May) where lunch and dinner and free! You would get a pulled pork sandwich, a side and a drink for nothing. The lines would be out the door, but the food is worth the wait. I also remember them offering a free dinner (cant remember the choices) on your birthday. Its a cute little place in downtown Gilbert. Check it out."
5,"It is almost impossible to find a great sandwich shop that actually has good grinders and sandwiches.  Well my search is over.  I stumbled across this little shop and felt right at home in New England.  Being from Connecticut, I was so excited to see all the great food on the menu.  I had the Vermonter and it was bliss at every bite.  The owners are extremely friendly and you can tell that they want you to be very happy with their food and service.  Great food and great service, you will not be dissapointed...."
4,"As I revealed in a previous review, my family loves InnSuites. This location is nestled in the Squaw Peak Mountain Preserve, close to the prestigious Biltmore area, and offers easy access to downtown Phoenix, Scottsdale and the Camelback corporate corridor.  InnSuites offers comfotable, clean rooms for a very rasonable price. And as with all of the InnSuites locations, the Northern location includes amenities such as free social hour and free hot breakfast with eggs, potatoes, waffles, toast, cereal, yogurt, fruit, coffee, milk & juices. There isnt really much within walking distance at this location, so either plan to hang around the pool a lot or youll need to have a car."
3,"Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum. Good selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and theres anything left in it.  Id give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience. I think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they cant handle the heavy flow on weekends.  Theres not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.   Dim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, its swarmed on by a pack of vultures. If youre willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, Id highly recommend China Chan.  Its much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menus much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh."
5,"I will give this place a 5th star even though i wait for 30+ mins every time i go. that can only mean its good right? Well, its that friendly AND that good that i dont mind waiting. i hope it doesnt lose that customer service aspect that makes it so approachable.  best sausage gravy in town with a nice spice to it. im not fond of their potato has thingys... but their bfast nachos are fab and their white out omelette is also very tasty. my favorite item - turkey sausage eggs benedict... DD style (trade sausage gravy for hollandaise) - very filling as you can imagine.  breakfast club will still be the old town brunch location for when visitors come visit me but for week in and week out sunday morning brunch, this is my spot."
4,"Great find! The boyfriend and I were aiming to check out Geisha A Go Gos happy hour but no seats and loud music drew us to find a more intimate spot. Kyoto hit the spot! The sushi was great at a reasonable price off the regular menu. The staff was friendly and laid back yet still attentive which was refreshing.  I loved all the rolls we tried: (in order of favorites) caterpillar, Philadelphia, Salmon volcano (warning it is salt that they light on fire), tuna maki, and another I cant remember. Although the boyfriend is still partial to Roka Akor, I think this is my new favorite location! I definitely cannot wait to come back and please open a location in Glendale!"
5,"I loved Joes Farm Grill...you havent lived until you have tried the Blue Cheese Burger..(not sure what it is named on the menu)...I fancy steak encrusted with blue cheese, this burger is the next best thing.  Their garlic fries are to die for...heck, everything they cook is incredible...worth the drive..."
5,"Ive gone back a few times since my last review. Every single experience has been fantastic! The burgers are pretty good, BUT do yourself a favor and get the pork tenderloin OMFG!!! Sooooo freaken amazing!  Also their onion rings are pretty much perfect!  And the fried cheese curd...just get it! I was a little creeped out eating something called cheese curd, but holy deliciousness!"
3,"Well it was off to Brio last night for ""date"" night!!!   The last time we were at Brio was in September to celebrate our 16th Anniversary...yes consecutive years, and it was a great evening!  Last night, no so much.  In all the years weve been going to Brio, we have NEVER had such HORRIBLE service....ever! The food was as amazing as it always is, but the terrible service completely overshadowed the tasty treats from the kitchen.  Our server stood and waited for us to finish sitting and before we could even open our napkins was asking for our drink order, not a good sign of things to come.  So I opted for water to come while we contemplated our cocktails.  So the water came, then nothing....nothing....no one....nada.  After about 10 minutes the server returned for our cocktail order.  The longest 10 minutes in history Ill admit.  So off to get the drinks....15 minutes later they arrived with the bread for the table...now mind you wed been sitting alone at the table with no attention for 25 minutes now.  That is a lifetime for a restaurant that makes their money by turning tables.  When the drinks and bread arrived we opted to put in our dinner order, thinking wed be in for a long bumpy night.  So we ordered, I ordered the Campanelle Carbonara, but with the Spicy Pepper Sauce from the Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant Appetizer, as opposed to the traditional sauce.  The server said no problem, you want the Angel Hair Pasta with the Spicy Sauce, do you want to add Shrimp or Chicken???  Well the Campanelle Carbonara comes with Chicken, Spinach, Bacon, and Parmesan Cheese.  So I explained it is NOT Angel hair Pasta as the Campanelle is a trumpet shaped pasta with curled edges.  He said ""Oh you want the Lasagna Noodles"".....!  Of course I just said ask the chef to prepare the entree as he usually would, BUT, substitute the sauces.  Glenn ordered the same, but with the traditional sauce.  We both opted for the wedge salad, and asked that our entrees not be fired until we were completed with our salad.  After all, we all know all the ingredients are pre-made, and just needed to be assembled and heated..  Whew...I felt...that was exhausting!  Then the salads arrived.  Ice cold, yummy...!  Now we are back on track.  Boy that salad does hit all the notes that take you back to your childhood.  Nothing is better than Ice Cold Iceberg Lettuce w/blue cheese dressing, bacon crumbles, and fresh shaved Parmesan cheese!!!   Then it happened.....yes just as we thought, in order to speed up the process that started so slowly............our entrees arrive BEFORE we were even 1/2 way through our salads.  So there they sit...all beautiful, completed just as ordered...and no Lasagna Noodles, no Angel Hair Pasta...just the wonderfulness awaiting our forks.  But...yes...But, wed not finished our salads.  By the time we did, our pasta was sad, cold, and looked like it had let us down.  It didnt, OUR SERVER DID....oh by the way were we EVER asked if we wanted anything else to drink???  You guessed it NO....were we EVER asked how our dinner was???  You guessed it NO... Now youre probably saying, why didnt you do something about it?  Wed have loved to, but there was no one around...not even someone to fill our water glasses.  Only after we were finished with our sad, cold, entrees and had stacked all the dirty dishes in a pile on the edge of the table, did our server make an appearance to ask how our dinner is going??? Are you kidding me???  We just asked for the check.  Upon his return we presented him with the discount that Brio had sent us for being frequent diners, he took that and never returned.  After sitting there at an empty table, empty water glasses and nothing to look at but the crumbs left behind from the wonderful flat bread.  We placed cash on the table and left to try to reclaim our evening.  On the way out, Glenn finally spotted a manager and explained our evening and that it would be a VERY LONG time before we tried Brio again.  He, the manager, just stumbled over his words and said he wished hes known about our evening so he could have done something about it.  Well maybe if hed been circulating on the floor as opposed to hanging out with the ever so cute hostess hed have known.  Do we still like Brio...YES...are we extremely disappointed with our service last night...YES....."
5,This place is so great! I am a nanny and had to bring in a dance outfit to get the straps shorten for the girl I care for. The woman did this for no charge! It was only the second time I went there. She said it would only take her two minutes so no charge. She was super sweet!
5,"Teresa S. and I were one of the lucky ones to win tickets to see Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci last night at the Symphony Hall, and we were impressed with the acoustics. The overall sound quality of the live act was fantastic, so overall Id say that the gig was pretty amazing. Its a fabulous hub of culture, but the food concessions need some urgent attention. The only munchies they have are desserts like cookies or pies, so be sure to have dinner first. One of the great things they offer is you can now pre-reserve your intermission drinks. You can pre-order your favorite libation before the show, and they will have them ready on the refreshment table.  That would save you time in case you need to whiz to the loo, and not have to wait in line again to buy your drinks. Thank you again to Yelp and Arizona Opera. The show was wonderful."
3,Really good prices but I would stray from the wings. It is very greasy so beware!
5,What a place for brunch. $4 drinks are fantastic. Their tenderloin egg Benedict and sea food sandwich is heavenly. Wish we had such a place in Los Angeles.
4,"They have plenty of equipment so there should never be a wait for anything. They offer great classes, although they tend to get too full sometimes. It would be nice if there was a restroom up front so you dont have to walk through the entire shower/locker room if all you need to do is pee!"
1,"MY EXPECTATIONS WERE EXCEEDED!  Ive been searching for so long to have a dinner experience that MET all of my expectations - for a restaurant that I SHOULD NEVER PATRONIZE.  Mimis in Goodyear actually exceeded my expectations.  On Oct 26th, while visiting the area, I made the unfortunate mistake of recommending we dine at Mimis because of previously good food and service there.  But, alas, if the old Mimis quality still existed, they wouldnt have exceeded my expectations for WHAT NOT to experience in a restaurant. Let me recant why YOU or ANY ONE ELSE (except those people you truly dislike) should never patronize this facility.  First of all, the interior temperature was at least 80 degrees (when it was less than 65 outside).  We had to ask for the air conditioning to be turned on. Next, we ordered the artichoke dip appetizer.  It looked funny.  It tasted funny.  The tortilla chips actually resembled pita chips.  If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it must be a ______. I ordered the chicken cordon bleu which is supposed to be served with ""seasonal vegetables"" and ""homemade mashed potatoes"".  Can someone explain to me how MIXED seasonal vegetables can be served where the brocolli is steaming hot, but the carrots mixed with them are literally still frozen in the middle?  Thats a feat.  My ""homemade"" mashed potatoes?  Cold.  A sliver of butter placed on top of the mashed potatoes would not even melt to graphically show our waitress ""the problem"" .  Even after this effort, no offer from the wait staff (or manager-missing-in-action) was ever made to either warm up the potatoes, replace them ......or, perhaps, use them as wall spackling. After all this, they sincerely asked us if ""everything was all right"" and ""would we care to order dessert"".  At least they have a sense of humor. Never again."
5,"We saw a small door with a sign over it and were intrigued, so we went inside - thats how we found Kazimierz.  Once our eyes adjusted (its dark inside, like any good speakeasy), I loved the decor.  Its a wine bar with food that seems to be Egyptian flatbreads and then whatever the chef wants to make.  We were there on a Saturday, right in the middle of happy hour, and enjoyed a ridiculous evening of items that were mostly $8.  Wine flights, flatbreads, certain bottles of wine = $8.  BOTTLES OF WINE.  Im sure they were just cleaning out old inventory, since they have hundreds of listings, but for these two wines, until they ran out of bottles, the bottles were $8.   We had the Northern Territory flatbread (pancetta, yukon gold potatoes, rosemary, crème fraîche and smoked gouda). Yum. We also had an open faced sandwich made with smoked pork belly, apple butter and melted cheese with sweet potato chips on the side.  IT WAS $7.  Between the $8 bottle of wine and that, I felt like I was stealing from these people.  The bartenders were great, as so was the music.  I will, without question, be going back."
5,"Our go to pizza place! Dont see how they could improve in any area. Customer service is excellent, immaculately clean and the food is PERFECTION!"
5,"The quintessential Brewery with a wholly fantastic kitchen. Best spinach artichoke dip in the valley, period. From fried to gourmet Four Peaks has it all. Beerbread sandwiches are always excellent, fish and chips, bavarian pretzels, french fries, daily specials, I really havent had an item that I didnt like! The weather is perfect right now for a sunny patio lunch or fresh air dinner.  Lets not forget the beer. My favorites are the Oatmeal Stout or the Peach. Their peach beer is legendary with low sweetness and a crisp refreshing taste. If you think cider is too sweet but like fruity flavor, this is your beer. The oatmeal stout is thick and hearty with no bitterness. Seasonal beers abound, pumpkin porter in the fall, Ive seen an orange blossom, belgian white, barleywine, etc. Parking close can be a challenge on weekend nights, best to ride your bike if youre close enough.  http://www.fourpeaks.com for a complete menu. Just go there already!"
1,"I give this place NO stars. They have karaoke which would be good except for the co-host is NASTY! The rest of the bar is typical with darts, pool and poker. The food SUCKS! dont bother to go here unless you like being whined at by a wussy faggot at night long. I know that is harsh but the co-host really is nasty."
1,"Do not go to this car wash. I dropped my kids off at choir and thought Id run in for a quick car wash. Oh no! They locked my keys in the car. I couldnt get On-Star to unlock my Suburban because it was under a huge canopy and couldnt get a signal. Instead of calling a locksmith, the car washers tried and tried to get in through the window. Thankfully my husband was able to leave work early, go retrieve the kids from choir practice, and then come rescue me at the car wash with a spare set of keys. I was trapped there over an hour!  The manager then had the audacity to get mad at me because I was upset at their incompetence. They didnt even comp the car wash!  If you go here, dont pay for your car wash until your car is done!"
1,Was I there on a bad day or what?  I showed up 15 minutes after they opened and EVERY item I tried was either luke warm or cold.    They have 15+ items on the lunch buffet and I tried a bite of all of them.   Gross and bland.   I felt sick to my stomach after I left because I kept thinking how bad the food was. Yuck!
5,"Beautiful hotel, great rooms, best views out of the resorts in the immediate area.  Service is comparable to a Ritz Carlton.  Very understated and clean feeling, yet still over the top luxurious."
4,"Been to the Spotted Donkey in Carefree multiple times and always been happy.  (cant speak to their new location on Hayden as we havent been there yet).  The drinks are very good, if a bit pricy and the apps are wonderful.  Ordered the short stack of nachos, stuffed peppers and enchaladas this time.  All very good and tasty.  One note, everything seemed to be a bit ""saucier"" this time, especially the nachos.  While the sauce is very good and tasty with a good amount of spice, it was a bit mcuh for me.  I dont remember it being that way before so perhaps this was a fluke. Will definately be back"
5,"Perhaps youve heard of the Library of Congress.  Nice Library. Burton Barr Central Library has a bigger reading room. Wil Bruder was the Architect.  You either love his work, or you hate his work.  I love his work!  And, this library is as good as it gets. Arrive in the sixth floor reading room a little before Noon *on* the Summer Solstice.  Ask a librarian:  Theyll tell you why. [ah, the mystery....]"
4,"This is a delicious neighborhood restaurant! I cant speak to their sushi much because I have become such a fan of other items on the menu. The handful plus times I have had sashimi here it has always been good. Now on to my favorites! The Asian nachos are a must get. Instead of tortilla chips they use wonton chips. Topped with a yummy cheese sauce, salsa, sour cream, and guacamole. Their guacamole is a mix of avocado and edamame. Yum! Add some chicken and these are super yummy and great for sharing. During my most recent visit here I discovered they have a new edamame. Bun Bo Edamame. Its very spicy. Too spicy for my tongue but the friend I was with loved it. Saved the best for last - the Mojo dessert. I am not a big dessert person, but I almost always order dessert here. It looks like a sushi roll. You get rice krispy treats, rolled up with Nutella, ice cream and a brownie in the middle. Delicious!!!"
5,"Every time I go into this place its with good times and cheery mates and I leave the wiser with a pint of fresh brew and some of the best food.  To make a great date, go to the Phoenix Rock Gym first and then climb the ladder on the back wall and walk in around the back...Great times for every one!"
5,"I was sad to come back to lai lais and they no longer had the Mongolian :( boo,, but i took my mom there and we were starving so we decided to order off the menu. My mom is allergic to  msg and they helped us with what we should order. and she didnt get sick!! woo hoo.. we ordered three dishes and an appetizer to share between her , my bf, and myself, and we stilll brought food home, and I dont think we spent over $30 bucks for all that food!! it was very good to! i love good cheap food!! Ill be back, they are always friendly."
4,"I have now played Longbow three times (twice in 2009, and once in 2010).  I do have to say its a fine course for all tastes. I cant say its a 5 star course, because it doesnt have quite the scenery and/or elevation changes that some that are nearer to the mountains have.  But it has enough interesting holes to make it a unique experience. Its not a gimmicky course by any means.  The course is more or less flat, with enough mounding on the fairways and around the greens to make it challenging.  One major advantage this course has is that there are not any houses on the course.  This means you dont have to worry about breaking anything if you like to slice the ball; the worst that can happen is that you lose your ball in the desert. I also really like the fast greens.  These greens are among the fastest and the truest Ive played, and its really a delight to putt on them. This is a great course for a cheap afternoon round during the summer.  For $40, you are probably better off going a few miles down the road to Las Sendas, but sometimes in the afternoon rates can be had for under $30."
2,"Five Guys is great for those days when you want to spend $12 on a glorified fast-food hamburger. The meat comes in a wafer-thin patty, and doesnt really taste like anything, just like at Wendys. The bun tastes mass-produced.  I also dont especially care for their fries, although this is a matter of taste more than anything. Im not generally one for mushy, thick, ""natural"" fries of the sort served here.  I cant help but wonder if people rate this place purely on the quantity of food that you get. The normal size for the burger is a double-patty, and the fries come overflowing from a 12 oz. drink cup.  I would rank the burger places around mill as: 1) Smashburger, for their delicious Arizona burger, and the awesome smash fries 2) Chuckbox, for delicious char-grilled meat that actually tastes like meat 3) In-n-out, for great-tasting meat and some of my favorite fries 4) Five Guys, 5) Fatburger, seriously why the fuck does anyone eat at Fatburger?"
4,I just love this place and  I always leave feeling refreshed and relaxed.  Highly recommend any of their spa treatments.
5,Im giving Yolis 5 stars for the winning combination of great food for a great price at a quaint location. Went there on a Saturday late in the morning and we were seated right away.  Great little hideaway in downtown Chandler.  I ordered the Morning Monte.  It was delicious.  My family ordered various other items and we all sampled a bit off each others plates and everything was excellent.  My favorite item was the chorizo burro.  Excellent chorizo with the correct combination of meats and spices.  The waitress was friendly and we chatted with the owner and she was very nice also. Another really great thing about this place is the prices.  I dont think there are any items above $8 and most meals here are in the $6-$7 range.  Very reasonable for the good quality food you get. After breakfast we took a walk around the courtyard and had a nice time looking around at the plants and exotic birds they have on site.  We also got a chance to meet the owner of the property and she was super nice also.  I will definitely be back to try out some other menu items.
4,"They built a Sauce in Minneapolis & it only lasted three months. Ill never understand why, but Im excited they are in Arizona & plenty of them.  The Turkey & Feta salad is almost identical to my favorite at True Food Kitchen, which is a great thing. The paninis Ive tried have always been good & come with a side of seasoned chips. Ive never tried any of the pastas, but they all look wonderful as well. Great place for a quick, affordable, good meal."
3,"The experience we had was just fine.  Food, service and wine list were all good - salad bar was good too.  I am not sure if Id go out of my way to go back though.  There are a lot of trendy and fun places to dine in the Scottsdale area and this one seems to be like the ""Grandfather of Scottsdale Dining"" - older and almost antiquated."
5,"We were staying at the Claredon and the desk clerk (who is also from Yuma) told us that their restaurant was voted best Mex in Phoenix and she swore it was true so we had to try it. The elote (roasted corn with cheese and smokey paprika) was fab, as was the ceviche! The carne asasda taco was tasty, as so many have already said. The real stars, however, were the pork belly and vegie tacos. Ill be dreaming about those til our next trip north."
4,"Ive been here so many times, I cant believe I havent reviewed Black Bear yet! This is me and my friends ""go-to"" breakfast place. Ginormous portions, and for a decent price. A little slow on the service, but if youre not in a hurry its no big deal. Basically down home cooking. You see diner and that is exactly what you get. Good eats!"
4,"Good place to have a beer, duck fart, or whatever you may fancy.  I am absolutely in love with their fried pickles. They are so far my favorite in the valley. Long sandwich style slices with a crispy light beer-esque batter. They also have some wonderful perogies on the menu. If you order a burger... you must try the red cabbage slaw as a side. I like going here to just have a low key night. Good place to watch sports too- thats just not really my scene."
3,"Bad service, great food, awful coffee."
3,"Hulas seems pretty hyped. I had drinks here that were OK. I had food here that was OK. Ill try it again and get an entree, but Ill not likely go out of my way to make it here."
5,"Excellent wings. I realized how much I miss this place when I ate horrible chicken wings in San Jose.  It gets crowded Tuesday and Thursday because of special deal on wings, but definetly worth it.  They do not have any Native NewYorker in CA :("
5,"Alas...Ive given up the idea of writing a review for a place if it isnt at least 4 stars. Sue me; Im in the industry.  Fuego Bistro is by far one of the best places Ive been to recently. I was introduced to it this last weekend on a date. Ironically, its super close to my house yet Ive never heard of it. When we were arriving, I was a little curious to see where the hell he was taking me since there arent any signs really and its pretty hidden. Once we were inside, though, it was like finding a little treasure. The patio is welcoming & even though we didnt have a reservation (aka we couldnt sit outside) we snagged a table close enough to enjoy the beautiful weather.  We started off with a round of mojitos and even though its been a few years since theyve won best mojito...I can say the Prickly Pear was the best Ive had in a while. The Ahi Tostadas followed & they were awesome...the sauce added a kick to it & it was a perfect start to the meal. After, we shared the Fuego Pasta with chorizo, chicken, mushrooms, peppers, & a chipotle cream sauce...huge! What I did eat of it was delicious. My favorite (and my dates Im fairly certain) was the special...an herb crusted Mahi Mahi with a pineapple sauce, home-made cornbread, & chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes. Amazing. Even though the Mahi Mahi might be hard to come by if you visit, the two sides arent & are so good, Im droolin just thinking about it. :) Dessert? Try the banana burrito. Heaven on the tongue! Kevin was an excellent server which just highlights the night. Its hard to have a great meal without great service but he provided just that. If youre in the area...check it out. If you arent...check it out. Im pretty sure you wont be disappointed."
3,"Ok, I usually write longer more intricate reviews about a restaurant but for this new establishment I will summerize. 1.  Great decor and ambience; would be better minus the flat screens 2.  Friendly service; but needs more training with food and knowledge of  3.  Timing of Kitchen; if a table has two or more persons, food should come out at the same time or around the same time.  Especially when they are not sharing. 4.  Food; if you specialize in spring rolls, please make sure they are rolled up proficiently.  It needs to be tight, not loose:) Flavors are good, but there could be a variation of sauce for the spring rolls.  4 rotating flavors for over 20 rolls is not a good ratio. 5.  Pricing is not bad for some items, but I do agree with other reviews that for most items, the pricing is a little high for the neighborhood biz and the quality of food offered. Overall, nice place to hang with friends for a drink and nibble before the actual dinner somewhere else. I will give it a few more months for an update.  This place has potential, but not well executed. When opening a restaurant, you should be ready and able to.  If you are not, you should wait til the staff is well trained.   I believe the owner or chef is inexperience.  Hopefully, it will improve... Get to work guys!!"
4,"Located next to T-Mobile on the Southeast corner, the parking is terrible because of the ""always busy"" Paradise Bakery.  Good prices (about $1-2 less than most other places), quick service, good manicure and decent arm/hand massage, clean place. I plan to come back try out their pedicure soon."
5,"Jason Silberschlag pulls off a pretty amazing thing here in the metro-PHX area.  Three shops with their own quirky details, passion and identity.  Each tailors specifically to the demographic at hand, which I can totally get behind.  The fact that each shop has its own deal going on is awesome - I really dislike chains and the chain feel/look.  I hadnt seen Jason in a while at the other shops, the times Id frequented, and was happy to see him behind the bar when I came here for the first time. Just the same way the other Cartel shops have a selection of brewing methods, this one does as well.  Pour-over, aeropress, Chemex and traditional espresso (La Marz GS/3). As expected from him, our drinks were flawless.  He transfers this knowledge and passion to the baristas, which is obvious even when one leaves his establishment to go somewhere else - they stand out in the crowd of many coffee-pullers.  The beans, who can complain?  Jason made his name with the roasting. I got a prepared sandwich here, and my was it tasty.  Bread was fresh.  Sauce, ingredients and overall creation was good.  Big Ben: you stole my tastebuds heart that morning. Casual lounge area (see: couches), outdoor covered seating (see: hallway - shaded and cool!) and plenty of seating inside.  As normal, his handiwork shines throughout the shop.  Somehow Ive never reviewed a Cartel shop before, despite my years of patronage.  My latest experience changes that."
4,"A short review is in order here because after all we are talking about freakin donuts.  However, in AZ there are no good donut shops for the most part.  We had three donuts - glazed, chocolate long john, and a chocolate old fashioned/sour cream.  The last was a bit stale.  The first two were great.  We will go back.  Nice little place and its open 24 hours."
4,"Satisfied my sweet and savory liking in a single swath.  Just had my first visit here and will be back soon.  The crepes were tasty and light, the service was attentive and friendly.  Too bad they arent open later for a sociable evening with dessert and caffeine."
4,"There are other places in town that are less expensive with better sushi choices, and not as loud, but I had an experience today that inspired me to write here this evening.  I go to Ra (Scottsdale Rd) somewhat frequently for their lunch special which is a good deal: miso soup, yummy salad with addictive ginger dressing, a california roll and four pieces of nigiri. Good stuff. I usually upgrade to a rainbow roll and just pay the difference.  A few months ago I went to a different sushi place in Tempe. I paid with cash and when my change was returned, the server had ""rounded up"" and treated himself to a presumptuous tip (he didnt return my coins). I called the manager over, went home and wrote a bad review on Yelp, tell people not to go to that restaurant and wont return to eat there again. This afternoon I sat at the sushi bar, had excellent service, good happy hour eats, and good discussion with the young sushi chef. I paid with cash and my Ra server gave me back my change ... minus coins. I immediately got tense and thought ""great, here we go again."" I called her over to explain. She said that she had rounded-up - in my favor. I counted my bills and saw that she had indeed given me back my change plus a little extra. She said that she didnt have coins, so she just gave me the difference.  I thought that was very cool. I thanked her, and left a big tip. Now Im writing about my good experience at Ra Sushi on Scottsdale Road and will definitely keep going there.  Its amazing how one little gesture will have such ripples."
3,"I was NOT too impressed with this place but...  it was good for Phoenix, where I am starting to realize there is NOT an abundance of people who look like me.  =/   LOL!  Flavor-wise I thought it was pretty good.  Dont be misled by the spring rolls...  Even though it says they serve them in 3s...  its 3 that are cut in half...  so you get 6 pieces.  This is pretty good if youre looking to share with someone.  I did not get a lot of lettuce and mint, though and ate the last two pieces by themselves.  I was a little disappointed by this. I had the combination Pho...  (YES i braved SOUP it in HOT ASS ARIZONA) and it was not too bad either.  The broth was nice and clear, just portion wise...  was not as extra large as I expected it to be. When the bill came, I ended up paying about $18 total which included tax and tip and no drink.  I think the Pho was almost $10.00 and the Spring Rolls were like $4 and some change? I think this place is cool but would not be my FIRST choice when it comes to pho.  (Trust me...  Ive eaten a LOT of pho)  I just don;t think the price vs. portion is worth what you;re paying.  This saddens me to say too because, I am ALL about supporting small Asian businesses.   Oh well..."
1,"Quick spot for a mall-made mayo-based California roll. This is where you go to learn how sushi can go wrong. Youve been hard at work doing swipe-and-sign. Perhaps you even dropped a thousand bucks at Neimans on a worthless Jhane Barnes sweater and some silk-lined Zanella slacks or three thousand on a whats-left-of-last-seasons-collection of Brioni blazer. Whatever your fancy, youre toting a wrist full of roped, glossy, shooshing-sounding bags with tissue paper sticking out the tops. You just want a break and some cool refreshing sushi. Its OK, but beware. Unagi and other ""hot"" items have a ""beep-beep beep-beep"" before they get to you. California and spicy tuna rolls come real quick -- cause they come from a vat of mayonnaise. Rice is not right either. Stick to tuna and salmon sashimi and miso soup. If head chef Rick is there (think Kyoto of Empire at 24th and Camelback, then Ichi Ban, University off McClintock), ask him to make you a Fat Bob on Acid, for good ol times sake. Or just go to Starbucks, tide yourself over, and find a real sushi restaurant. And about the Brioni... Dont sweat the buyers remorse. Itll make a great tax deduction to Florences."
4,Love the medium wings and green salad with thousand island dressing!  The bartender CJ is da bomb!
5,"Where to begin? This is my favorite Mexican food establishment ever. Ive been frequenting Carolinas for years and never once have I been disappointed. Some might compare it to Filibertos or any of those [insert surname here]bertos but this is on a whole different level. Atmosphere-wise its one step above a sketchy hole-in-the-wall but the food makes up for everything the appearance of the place lacks. I dont know their secret but their beans, the tortillas, the salsa... its all to die for. And ITS. SO. CHEAP. Like, seriously, Id dish out more money for this food but the fact that it really is that cheap is the icing on the cake.  Its almost always busy but its always worth the wait. Always. If you havent gone... youre missing out."
3,"This place is fun for drinks. Although, I wouldnt suggest eating here... My friend and I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup. I love tomato soup - even cheap stuff in a can... but what they served us didnt even resemble soup at all! Without any exaggeration, it was literally pizza sauce. I hope it was some sort of mistake... but who does that? Puts straight pizza sauce in a bowl with a spoon? I had been drinking all night and was starving and still couldnt eat it. That being said, the staff here was great and the service was really fast."
4,"This is one of my favorites stores to head to when I need the motivation that comes from new triathlon clothing and accessories. The staff is knowledgeable and helpful, without being intimidating.   They have a decent selection of womens items that are high quality and come with a high price - so I normally head there when Im looking for race wear/accessories and go elsewhere for regular workout clothes.   They do have some sale items, and recently I found some great Pearl Izumi tri shorts for half off - woo hoo! Its great to have stores like this geared towards triathlons!"
4,"Over the last 3 years weve lived in the area, this place has changed 4 times.  First Uncle Bears, then Tio Osos, then Thirsty Cactus (or Thirsty Cantina, whatever, it sucked), and now its TCs Pub & Grub.  The menu is typical bar food, including burgers, sandwiches, pizza, wings as well as some taco and quesadilla selections (which I always appreciate a good quesadilla so I will have to try it next time).  The restaurant section (which was always dead before) has now been opened up and TVs added so the whole place is more of a bar feel (thumbs up).  The place was packed for Thursday night football (Cardinals game!), but still got a good table close to a TV.   Server (who admitted multiple times he was brand new) was very friendly but had to keep asking other servers for clarification on menu, etc.  Still, nice enough and very attentive. We ordered wings (""medium"" but they were spicy!) and their ""ugly"" crust pizza with mushrooms and olives.  The wings, very good, I would get them again.  Pizza, I wouldnt order it again if someone paid me.  The ""ugly"" crust basically is a thick hand tossed crust - too much crust (and half of it was burned) and very skimpy on the toppings.  It was pretty horrible honestly.  The actual toppings (although sparse) were very tasty... good cheese and fresh mushrooms and olives, so I would order pizza here again IF they have a thinner crust option.  Otherwise, if you are coming here to carb load and really need your bread fix, by all means, order the pizza.  I personally prefer a thinner NY style crust. All in all I would come here again based on the good wings and service, and Im looking forward to trying their other menu options.  p.s. text TCSPUB to 411247 and theyll send you a text coupon for a 50 cent draft. Score! (Im a sucker for a deal)  Cheers!"
4,"I will begin by saying that Ive been wanting to try this place for months now, simply because they have a salad that bears my name. Which reminds me of my high school days, when the internet was new and I spent an afternoon with a friend visiting websites that also had our name. Most ended up being adult sites, but tonia.com* was an Asian company that had my name written in a fantastic logo. I wonder what it means.  Anywho, not only does the salad live up to its given name, but Moto is now on my backup sushi rotation. Reasonably priced and of good quality, I was extremely full by the time I ate only half of my dinner. The Tonia salad I actually had for lunch a day later, and was very filling and delicious. I can only imagine what it wouldve been like eating it the same night. Had it not been as great, I wouldve never came back and written to the owners, demanding the salad change to a lesser awesome name, maybe one more common or boring. My to go order was ready exactly when they said it would and I was in and out the door in minutes. Ill be back. *I have no idea if this is still the same site anymore. I am not responsible for where the link leads.. now.. or in the future"
4,"The ""Shoe Dog"" experience was quite fun and entertaining!  It assists in finding the right shoe for your foot...and pretty accurate! Shop from hundreds of the best walking and running brands like ASICS, adidas, Brooks, New Balance, Saucony, Mizuno, Merrell, Nike, Puma, Pearl Izumi, Sperry, Timberland, Under Armour. Youll find fantastic natural running shoes from Vibram Five Fingers, Newton Running, and K-SWISS and trail shoes from Merrell, Salomon, and UK Gear.

1,"If it wasnt for the bad food I would go here more than once or twice a year.  The meat was dry and tough in my first entree and not edible in my second. Now when my wife drags me here to watch a movie, I order a salad only. Because they do catering, I have a suspicion that they serve up left over food from catered events to their restaurant customers.   The service is OK. They have a couple of generic draft beers. Everything is overpriced.  Caveat Emptor if you order an entree."
4,"Great outdoor patio, couches, big bar, tables, great burgers, huge side of crunchy fries and they carry sweet tea vodka.  Do not order the sangria, unless you like it super sweet. I dont, Im sweet enough already."
2,"Returned here after a years absense. I understand they have had a change in management. some for the better, some for the worse. new general manager and now the service seems much friendlyer and efficient. New chef and now food is slow to arrive and not as good as it used to be. steak was charred, mashed potatos were lukewarm. Took over 30 minutes for our food to arrive. hopefully it was just an off night for the kitchen. but the general feel was that they lost the attention to the little details"
5,This was our first time at Texas BBQ House. They gave us a sample and help us with our order. The brisket was fantastic. I got the moist and my wife got the lean. We both enjoyed our choices immensely. I will definitely go back. I wanted some spicy BBQ sauce and apparently they have it but I didnt see it.
4,"I went to Sabas feeling a little scared.  Fast food Greek in a strip mall?  This could go one of two ways...surprisingly good or health code violation bad.   I am very glad to say it didnt end being the latter.  In fact, the food here was pretty damn good.  I did expect Sabas to be an order at the counter joint, so I was a little disappointed to see it was actually a tiny restaurant.  I like my Greek fast and cheap, okay?  But I got over it, got a table and began the interminable wait for our server to stop chatting with other diners and take our order. The menu has all the normal Greek items, including falafel- little fried balls of joy I might add- gyros, vegetarian platters, spanakopita and dolmas.  Prices for the sandwiches and gyros are pretty cheap, but when you venture into the platter territory, youre going to pay for it. Platters start around $10 and go up.  I ordered the falafel, of course, and so did my boyfriend.  The pita sandwiches dont come with any sides, so we ordered a basket of fries to go along with our meal. The dcor was pretty cool with big pictures of Greece all over the walls and the classic Greek music piped in.  Unfortunately, not even the Greek music could mask the hideous, loud tool of a diner that was sitting at the table in front of me. He was one of those idiots that has to talk so loud, even the half-deaf cook in the kitchen can hear him.  He was so loud I felt like I should respond to his questions.  Hey moron- saying things like ""I like it loose, like my women,"" is just not funny. Anyways, when we finally got our food, it was really good.  The falafel pita and the fries were tasty, but our server sucked.  He obviously knew the loud tool, and kept chatting with him while we waited for our check.  That was a little annoying, but overall, Sabas is a good choice for a quick Greek meal."
4,"Brio is delish, plain and simple. I have yet to get something that isnt tasty. I live about 15-20 miles from one so I dont get out there too often but I do wish there was one closer to my area."
1,"I hadnt been to Fuddruckers for about 20 years... now I know why.  Cashier was nice and very helpful.  I ordered bacon cheese burger combo.  Fries were only warm, not hot.  Burger was not very tasty and it was full of gristle bits... you know the ones that stick between your teeth.  Lots of trash on the floor.  After we were finished, someone came to ask how things were.  I told here about the fries and she offered to get me more; I declined.  She offered a free dessert: I accepted.  In all, not a good experience, will probably be at least another 20 years before I go back."
1,"This place is worse than the IRS, at least the IRS admits when they made a mistake. But these arrogant workers will be caught dead before they hear themselves say ""sorry for the inconvenience"" or ""we made a mistake"".  They gave me different information on two consecutive visits that I made, then Dorrie, some lady who obviously should not have been working that day because she was coughing phlegm all over my documents, then after she asked me to wait by the counter for 10 minutes while their system updated.  I waited, 1 hour and 30 minutes later I finally went to the information counter and asked for Dorrie... I was told that she had gone to lunch 15 minutes ago and was told to go talk to another lady. She just dismissed me and I went to go talk to the new lady, who was also extremely rude and kept rolling her eyes and interrupting me before I could finish my sentences.  Basically i spent total of 3 and a half hours waiting and getting attitude and nothing was resolved because of their mis information and Dorries idiot customer service ethics and the last ladys pride..  not one person resolved anything and they all were too proud to say ""we apologize for the inconvenice"".  I recommend this place if you wanna be late to work 2 or more hours and having your mild mannered patience tested to the maximum."
4,"I entered the CPK world late in life, and Im sad about it because, apparently, Ive been missing out.  CPK is great!  Contrary to what I thought, its not just a place for pizza.  Although the place can suit all sorts of tastebuds, I would recommend going JUST for the pizza.  I went this evening for the second time in two weeks and ordered the BBQ chicken chopped salad.  It maybe couldve used a little more dressing, but it was still good, so I cant complain too much.  When I went last week, I ordered one pizza from the MANY great options available, and I have to say, there is a reason it is called the California PIZZA Kitchen and not the California SALAD or PASTA Kitchen.  So Yay!  Im a fan. of the PIZZA here.  The other stuff....meh.   The servers are always pleasant here, and I never wait a long time for the food to come out.  Prices are what you would expect for a chain restaurant.  Parking isnt usually a problem unless theres an event going on at Tempe Marketplace.  The up-side to eating at this particular location is that you can browse the shopping area before you stop in or after youre done eating. Be forewarned: If you are ever asked if you want avocado with your salad, and you say yes, you WILL be charged extra.  Look out for this sneak attack."
3,"Alison B. sums up all the great things about this unique store - and I would return if I was looking for a unique gift for any female friends of mine. However, when I went in on a Sunday I was 1 of 4 women in the store.  The man working was chatting it up with the 3 other women who turned out to be together, and once they left he had a seat and didnt say a word to me as I browsed.  I walked out after several minutes of silence."
5,"The best fish tacos, period!  And I hate chain restaurants!"
5,"Heard about this interesting steak house from Lindsay, my Yelping go to and I am grateful. What a fun night, feeling ""Mad Men ish as we walked through the kitchen when entering the restuarant.  Atmosphere was amazing and the food.... WOW. My fav had to be the amazing steak and bean chili/soup.... fantastic. Steaks were our of this world and the mushrooms... devine. When entering the restaurant we greeted by helpful eager staff ... with each one adding input into our experience.... especially Patti, our server. She was helpful, informative, fun and sealed the deal of a fantastic night. Thanks"
1,"While the menu looked promising, have no idea if the food is any good since the hostess failed to even acknowledge our presence when we walked in the door.   We patiently stood there for several minutes while she walked around us to greet and seat two other parties.   Since we were still unable to get her attention,  we left and went to Tommy Bahama across the street."
4,I was so excited to visit The new Postino in Gilbert!!! I love and frequent the original but this new location is much closer to my house. Bruschetta is amazing!!! Love the atmosphere and staff too. Wine selection rocks!!! Great Happy hour prices!!! Highly recommend a visit!
4,"This is quite possibly the best hamburger on the planet.  I live for In-N-Out Burger when I head West and I was impressed by the friendliness of the staff and speed with which my order was processed during a busy Thursday evening. Id give this location 5 stars (and if I were rating the burger and service alone, its no contest), but I was disappointed by the fries.  They didnt taste as fresh as usual.  That said, they werent stale or frozen, so they beat every other fast food chain. Id certainly go back since my Double Double without, with pickles, sliced chilis, and extra spread was AMAZING. Be aware: they do not accept American Express, but Visa and Mastercard are just fine."
4,Stopped in for a business breakfast. I had the Chilaquiles with scrambled eggs. It was great. Its not really on my side of town but Id really like to go back and try some other dishes. Hefty portions at great prices. All four of us ate well for under $40 including drinks.
5,"Today our travels took us to the Chandler Mall on 10/31/2012. Therefore we were near to Abuelos for lunch. Nothing like returning to a Restaurant that you found to be very good! We arrived after 1PM, so we were seated ASAP. We ordered drinks first along with a serving of Guacamole. Nice way to start off lunch! My wife ordered the Dilla Lunch while I ordered the Grande Burrito Lunch special. Both item arrived on a very hot plate-wonderful! Whenever we are dining at another Restaurant, a hot plate is always expected but all too often the hot plate fails to appear. Our lunch stay hot until the last bite due to the hot plate service. Everything was great with the meal and no requested drink refills-always a sign of great service! Both restrooms were very clean and serviced many times during the day. We highly recommend Abuelos for a great lunch or dinner!"
2,"Ill be honest--this place is good for Americans... but not good enough for Chinese people.  The waiters were sort of rude to us, despite our being able to speak their language. Furthermore.. what kind of authentic Chinese restaurant serves dinner out of plates? Blasphemy! Our table to had to go out of our way to get bowls! Im surprised they had chopsticks. Otherwise, their mock  food was salty and pasty, perfect for Americans in search of a good Orange Chicken replacement.  Wait.. salty and pasty? Its supposed to be a (insert meat type) dish, consisting of subtle flavors and intense chili pepper action. Neeext..."
4,The staff were very friendly and the place was clean and didnt smell funny like some other fast food joints.
2,"Boring.  Uninspired.  Generally sauce-less, which means the meat courses are plain and dry.  The salmon tastes like styrofoam.  The filet is flavorful but they use low quality cuts.  The veggies are simply steamed.  No doubt the options are healthy, but at the sacrifice of flavor.  When I pay this much to eat out, I want to taste it and enjoy it."
4,"Wow.  The food and atmosphere here are great.  The music was a little too loud, but, for a weekend away, this place hit the spot perfectly.  The wait was rather lengthy, so we stalked the bar until some folks left, then had our dinner there.  I had the largest shrimp cocktail of my life, some really good wine, and grilled asparagus.  There are so many delicious options in Scottsdale, but, this is pretty specific in vibe. Check it out."
3,"I was so looking forward to going to this restaurant.  It has a nice view of a man-made pond, but the food is barely average.  If the ambience wasnt so nice, it would get only 2 stars."
5,"My wife and I celebrated our anniversary here for the first time. I have nothing but good things to say. Food, wait staff and overall experience were excellent. This is an old school type of steakhouse with red velvet wallpaper, leather booths, etc. If you havent been, I cant recommend it highly enough. Give it a try and youll be glad you did!"
1,"Dont do business at this unethical business. My $25 savings account from 2009 was  recently stolen from $5 a month for ""account inactivity"" fees. They are a bunch of crooks. It appears you now need to nickle and dime your customers with BS fees in order to stay in business.  Account closed."
4,"These guys scare me. We set up a repair with Karen for a noise in the dash area which i said seemed to coincide with the gauge movement at start-up. Well, we came back the next day and found we had a new stereo but the noise was louder. The dash was pulled and it was determined to be the A/C door actuators and Karen set an appt. for drop-off and rental car pick-up the following day. On the way down the A/C quit working completely. Angie called me the next morning to let me know we could pick up our one day rental as they replace the condensor. Nothing was said about the noise which we brought it in for originally and, more to the point, no knowledge of this at all was logged into their system regarding why we dropped it off the night before. We had already been set up in a rental car by Karen the day before but for some reason nobody had a clue what was going on and she and the technician had both gone on vacation. Finally after speaking with the service manager, Gary, and explaining to them what should have been in the notes on my car it was determined they would handle everything and we could keep the rental on their dime. This made me feel better and we picked up our car 2 days later with functioning A/C. On the way home from the dealership the A/C quit working again so back it went for another random repair. Tuesday came and we picked it up again after they had to make some A/C computer module fix but... on the way home from Coulter... my wife noticed the ABS and Traction Control lights were flashing red and indicating they were innoperative. So now the car was unsafe to drive but at least we had A/C to keep us cool if we had a wreck from the new issue. We took it back to night drop-off since they were now closed and this morning, Wednesday, they have it back in the shop to see what happened as they were doing the other work. Im so happy I dont own the warranty company since Im sure they are paying for all of these mistakes.  Hmmm... Update to follow - Noon 8/29 update - Our new service person, Ben, called and as it turns out this is totally unrelated to the A/C issue but is instead, the brake pedal sensor, whatever that is. Its ready to come home. Im beginning to think that the consumer reports review on this GMC Acadia is accurate. 40K+ for a good looking, nice handling, unreliable SUV.   Overall I have to say that once Gary and Ben were involved this has taken a turn for the better and maybe all this confusion was just a fluke. Ill give them another chance next time we have a service issue."
5,"As a bonafide recovering Art Bitch, I give this university gallery the blue ribbon award for kickassery! Truly a ""hidden gem"" (i hate that phrase) in Tucson, the collection and the revolving pieces never cease to impress me. I have brought almost every single tourist from the east coast to this gallery, including some photography professors, and they leave with snoooty mouths agape that in this pleasant little desert town resides a high-caliber, well manicured collection of the arts.  I am always upset when I visit and I cant stop by this gallery-and dont miss out out on their catalogs, magazines, books, postcards and prints they have in the atrium as unique gifts/decoration. Splleeeendid."
5,"Excellent service!!!! I had to find a spa different from lavenders after they got rid of yet another excellent staff member, so I tried this place! I was SO HAPPY!! clean, pleasant, warm, comforting. The manager is actually on site and aware of the things going on in their spa! The staff is friendly and efficient!  Lavenders day spa can learn from this place. Send the owner from lavenders to sanity and TAKE NOTES.  I HIGHLY recommend it here!!!!!! Go and enjoy!!!"
2,"Over the last 5 years or so, Ive eaten lunch at Dillys Deli a couple dozen times. The location is excellent, as it is near my office, and the interior décor is clean, modest, and charming. The music seems to vary, but on todays trip, it appeared to be a mix of oldies and jazzy easy listening. While Ive never had to wait for a table to clear, seating can be limited during lunch hours. The service is friendly and quick and the menu offerings plentiful and interesting. Vegetarians will find a handful of options here, though it is likely you can request to omit meat from any sandwich or salad.  Carrying Boars Head ingredients is a plus, however the way their sandwiches are assembled and the ratio of ingredients used simply doesnt work for me. Oftentimes, I find my sandwich has a bulge of deli meat in the center and much less (and sometimes none at all) toward the outer parts nearing the crust. It has been my experience that the wraps are not treated this way, though the only wrap Ive tried (Mexi) lacked flavor and tasted processed.  Ive eaten one salad at Dillys - the Greek - and, while it is tasty, I discovered a dead fly in it halfway through and havent ordered a salad there since.  As other reviewers have reported, the soups arent as piping hot as Id like, though the variety and additional ""daily soup"" is appreciated.  The bread is deliciously soft, warm, flavorful, and large - ideal for accompanying a soup or salad. If youre accustomed to filling up on a sandwich made with normal-sized slices, I suggest ordering a half sandwich so you can sample a side of soup, salad, or dessert as well. All sandwiches are served with a pickle spear. The cookies and brownies get 4 stars on their own. Today I gave Dillys another shot and ordered a new menu item, the Red Bird, on wheat. Personally, Im not a fan. The Blazin Buffalo, Dilly Bird, and Smokey Mountain boast far better flavor combinations, IMO. Also, my pickle spear had a hair on it. Dillys is a bit pricier than its nearby competition (All whole sandwiches are $6.99), though a reasonable price if shared. Overall, this is a higher quality sandwich shop than Subway, Blimpie, and the like. Unfortunately, the fly and hair experiences combined with the bread/meat ratio issue guarantee I will not return."
2,"I have been a long time customer at this car wash with this location. I have been going there since it Changed from Weiss Guys to Diamond Car wash and now its known as Francis and Sons. It seems the service has declined for each change of ownership.   Today was the tip of the iceberg and I will not be going there again. The past 2 visits have proven to me that their customer service has rapidly declined.   I understand that every business needs to ""Upsell"", but it becomes an annoyance when they keep bugging me 5,6,7,8 times after I have said no. Dont even get me started on their glass repair salesmen.... I always get the Premium auto wash, a few weeks ago I went and when I got home I noticed they had not cleaned my dash or center console (which is included in premium). I also noticed they had not wiped down my tires after applying Armor All and it all splattered up to the sides of my vehicle after driving away, I wrote these off as a simple mistake and that it probably would not happen again.   Todays experience was worse. I took my truck in for a wash and I told the guy I did not have time for a hand wax (upsell) I was then pressured into buying it in advance so I could come back another day and get it waxed. No was not an answer to this guy, I had to actually walk away to leave this Pressured UPSELL.   Again, I purchased the premium wash. They called for the vehicle and I noticed that there were little black spots (mud?) all over the side of the truck. I told the guy about this and he said ""its ready."" I explained that it wasnt and started using my finger to poke at what was probably 20-30 little black spots all over the side, he gave me a disgusted look and told me he had to go get a clean rag. I asked for a manager.   The manager came and had the guy wipe the spots off, but did not seem to care at all and walked away before the guy wiped down half of the spots. I had already given a tip to the first guy and this guy stood there expecting a tip, I am generous with tips, but will not tip more because I had to ask them to fix their mistake.   Upon entry of my vehicle I noticed there was still some dirt on the floor and my center console armrest was not cleaned. I only took the truck in due to my dog leaving paw prints on the center armrest and hair all over the place...   I got an oil change at Dannys Car Wash at Tempe Marketplace a few weeks ago, and was so Impressed by their service and car wash service that I will make the 20 minute trip to go up there for my car wash from now on."
4,"Creamy, luscious, divine...just some of the words that barely describe the wonderfulness that is Ritters frozen custard.  Short of having real Italian gelato (never been to Italy yet, so I cant even begin to compare the schtuff we have here), this frozen custard beats everything this side of town. Mix-ins, schmixins.  The custards yummy with or without.  Its more flavorful than teeth loosening sweet and they have over 65 to choose from...although they rotate around about 6 of them per day. It sure makes the moody blues go bye-bye with each spoonful.  Okay, Im being a little over-dramatic.  But it really is good! Price is right, service is great, and it would take a long time before you became bored with the flavors.  You could literally go every day and try something new.  Bad for hips, good for the little kid in all of us."
4,"Food is top notch and within a good price range for a weekend breakfast.  I dropped a star because its always so crowded theres usually a line to order your food.  That and theyre closed on Sundays.  Its a perfect weekend breakfast, how can you be closed on Sundays?!  But I eat here all the time."
3,"Ive grown to like Apple, though Ive always thought their products were priced on the rich side.  When we lived in Seattle there was a Microsoft bias, but a large group of us all had Apple iPhones.  And that is a key part to the Apple story.  You buy the iPhone and then the next thing you know, youre looking at iPads.   The Genius Bar is fun and very helpful when things go wrong; like when my new phone duplicating one calendar entry 341 times.  I had to bring in my Win-Tel PC into the Genius Bar and in the end we had to delete MobileMe to fix it.   But, absolutely great, GREAT customer service!!! I love my new iPhone 4, and Ive had Blackberries for 14 years!  Maybe when they add FaceTime to the iPads, Ill belly up to the Genius Bar."
5,"Great service, great food, highly recommend.  We had the scollops and they were to die for, the scotch beef and mac and cheese were also amazing.  Will definitely go back and recommend to friends."
5,"A friend of a friend was telling us about this place on Sunday morning, and how awesome their pizza is.  It sounded awesome, but he warned us the line is usually an hour and a half long.  Oh well, we went anyway.  Luckily, we were early enough where we didnt have to wait long for a table.  When we were leaving, though, the line was easily an hour long. We started with the wings, which come in an order of 14 and were delicious.  Five of us were dining there, so we ordered two small pizzas, with each one being a half, so we had a nice variety of pizzas to try from.  We got the BBQ Chicken, the Frisco, Grandma Gs, and one more that eludes me now.  All were pretty delicious, and I give them mad props for going out of their way to create unique pizzas with untraditional toppings (Grandma Gs had potato on it).  Our entire bill with a few drinks came to under $80. Oh, make sure you sit outside... the inside had a lot of loud kids, and it seemed to echo off each wall and annoy the hell out of our party.  The women in our party also said the air temperature kept changing in there.  Keep in mind, too, that they dont have a full bar, so if youre going there hoping to start off with a bloody mary, youre out of luck."
5,"The PERFECT Breakfast :)  If only I could have this every day :) Matts is all you want a breakfast spot to be...cute, friendly and the most amazing food out there. I highly recommend the hog and chick.  You just cant go wrong with eggs*, bacon*, home fries* (get the home fries, not the hashbrowns) and their toast* served with Terra Verde Farms preserves.  * = best ever, ever, ever I could write on and on...youve seen the reviews.  Just make sure to make it there, you wont be sorry, youll be addicted!"
4,"Not a bad visit. I regularly visit the Location in Columbus, OH. I have developed a certain expectation as to the type of service that should be implemented in this concept. Compared to Hooters, this place will eventually put Hooters out of business. The food is consistent and delicious. I am a huge fan of the shepherds pie  and Quinlans 5 cheese pizza. The service at this particular Location was a few notches below the service provided at the Scottsdale and Columbus Locations. The servers seemed under trained in how to communicate with the guests. That preferred to fraternize amongst themselves which was the only fault that was noticed. The place was clean, restrooms well maintained, and the food was expeditiously served. Prices are a little high but who are we kidding, commodities are up everywhere. I will always stop by when passing this concept. Compared to its competition of sports bars it is among the top of the list."
4,"I met up with a girlfriend at borders. This Borders is across from the Scottsdale fashion square. The store is inviting, clean, bright, and new. They have a variety of books, and good sales. Upstairs is the Seattles best coffee cafe. I had a coupon for a free medium drink when you buy a bag of coffee beans. I was surprised how good my cafe mocha was, better than Starbucks. note: If you have little kids, they do have story time on Mondays at 10:00 AM. Every Friday is Bean Friday in Seattles Best Coffee cafe. Buy a bag of beans and receive a FREE medium beverage."
5,"I love my eye doctor!  Platonically, of course.  The entire staff is relaxed, friendly, easy going, and personable.  No one ever makes you feel rushed but instead take time to make sure that everything is okay, that youve thought of everything, gotten all of your questions answered, and had plenty of time to make decisions and think.  The doctor takes time to get to know you and to talk about how you use your eyes (staring at the computer, sports, etc).  The assistants try to think of things from your point of view so they can volunteer useful information and ask a lot of specific questions while doing so.  This place treats you like family.  Theres a broad range of styles, but mostly, theyre fashionable frames.  When I go in, I see a lot of kids, young adults, and 20 and 30-somethings as well as the older patients who so often come to need glasses.  Horwitz costs a little more than the mall chains, but my prescriptions have been consistently better thanks to the doctor taking time, the lenses are much higher quality, and the frames are worlds better in terms of availability of things that arent ugly and durability."
3,"I can understand why everyone loves this place-- who wouldnt, right? With so many choices of cool, creamy gelato? Well, unless I am just very unlucky and visited on a bad day, this Gelato Spot has gone steeply downhill. My husband ordered a strawberry-kiwi flavored and I chocolate peanut butter. We both agreed: the gelato tasted grainy, with noticable ice crystals. And worse, the flavorings tasted like they came from a bottle, not fresh. IMO, this has become more of a place to see-and-be-seen -- not savor good gelato!"
4,"Both of the previous reviewers are correct, actually. Yes, there can be a line to the door at times, and not everyone working there is 100% nice 100% of the time. But who is? And, once you get to know them -- and are courageous enough to give them the benefit of the doubt -- everyone working there is very cool to deal with. Because this Post Office is tucked way back in the Foothills, its not staffed as heavily as Ive seen some others. But the remoteness of the location also means you get to breeze in and out on rare occasions too (seeing as this is too far out of the way for any non-Foothills residents). So, do like me: never go here in a hurry; be polite; be patient (its not all about you). And youll see this is really no worse than any other Post Office...and maybe even a little bit better."
4,"Im not a sushi expert by any stretch, but suffice to say that the rolls here are well-priced, fresh-tasting, and overall pretty damn delicious, with good presentation.  Im not a fan of their tea, but thats just a personal preference, I think. I enjoy the Las Vegas, but the Spank Me roll was really good as well. We usually mix and match our way around, and right now theyre running a ""happy day"" 4pm-9pm special on a lot of their rolls which makes them cheaper by $1-$3, each. Definitely worth it. Good service, laid back vibe, even if the decor is a little ""college dorm"" with the lighting, but overall, fun, good food, and affordable."
3,"Yelper Jane Bs review is remarkably similar to what I intended to include in my review. Weve stayed at close to a dozen different Homewood Suites over the years and this one left us wishing we could have stayed at any of the others instead. Furnishings were adequate but not terribly comfortable.  The living room had a sleeper sofa and a side chair, a dining table with two chairs, an end table, a coffee table, and a TV stand with 3 drawers plus the kitchenette, all in a room roughly 9 x 14. The bedroom contained a desk with 3 drawers (serving also as the dresser) and the bed and nightstands.  The desk also served as the TV stand, allowing a small work area and taking up so much room the door couldnt swing all the way open. Our bedroom also contained the mystery deadbolted closet with unknown contents, which took up half the guest closet space. The bathroom was large but dingy and dimly lit. I considered renting an on-demand movie one evening, but everything offered by the hotel was $15+/each (!!) and since there wasnt a DVD player we didnt have the opportunity to rent somewhere more reasonable and bring it back to our room.  Free wifi seemed stable although a bit slow, and the pool was small but the kids didnt seem to mind. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was well-prepared and always had enough variety to keep the kids and adults happy. We got a great rate but hey, its Scottsdale in the summer so most rates are pretty darn good.  Normally we enjoy staying away from home, but after 6 nights here even the kids were anxious to get home. Well stay at Homewood Suites again in the future, but not this one."
4,"Talk about options!  Its almost unfair to have so many items on a menu.   Especially when the food is so good.  I have gone to the Cheesecake Factory several times and have not been able to even put a dent in the menu. So, I wasnt too hungry this time, so I decided to order from the small plates menu.  We started with the corn fritters.  Then I ordered the shrimp and grits and my husband ordered the hibachi steak.   The only reason I didnt give them five stars is because we didnt get our appetizer until the our food was ready.  And by that time, we had already stuffed our faces with bread and butter (which is delicious)!  The server apologized for delay in bringing our app and the manager came by and didnt charge us for the corn fritters.  That was much appreciated!  We only had one of the fritters since our other dishes were in front of us and we didnt want those to get cold.   I really like the shrimp and grits.  I think the dish came with a little too much sauce...but thats just me....I just really liked the taste of the cheddar grits.  My husbands steak was really really good!  The hibachi steak is what I normally ordered.  I will go back again!"
3,"I love Greek food, but I need to stop letting my friends drag me to this restaurant. The staff is extremely friendly and the place is comfortable, but for me the food is always a disappointment. I know I know, its a chain... and maybe I just have high expectations, being that Im from back east where we have small family-run Greek restaurants on every corner."
3,"The coffee at this location is awful- please go get lessons from the lady at the Thunderbird and 40th street location. However, the primary morning guy, Shawn, is awesome. He is friendly and chipper, but not so much so that hes annoying as your first human contact of the day. He is generous with the toppings and speedy."
4,"Seriously, their happy hour prices cant be beat.  A beer, a spicy tuna roll, calamari and avocado egg roll for under $20 including tip.  Service was attentive and friendly.  We had to lurk around the bar area for awhile to get a table, but that only speaks to how popular this place is.  If you are looking for an inexpensive dinner out that doesnt involve Dennys or Olive Garden this is a great choice."
5,Harvest hash is incredible - ask for their house made BBQ sauce on the side.  Vegan raspberry banana bread French toast!!!  Sooooo good! Its a busy place on a Saturday morning but they work fast and everything runs smoothly. A gem!!!
1,"Most horrible buffet I have ever been to. My boyfriend and I are big chinese buffet fans. A ton of them have raised their prices recently (and, not surprisingly, have been closing down left and right).. so the prospect of a good buffet at 5-8 dollars was absolutely amazing. We read all the reviews on yelp and I had high hopes. Dear lord. The food is awful here. Inedible. Tastes very distinctly like a bad frozen dinner.  The only thing I remember being remotely food-like was some kind of beef and onion dish.. which tasted a bit like a philly cheesesteak. not exactly asian fare.. I tried really hard to like this place. My boyfriend didnt like any of it either. I dont understand how they have such good ratings. The ONLY thing I like about this place is their dessert bar, because they have toppings for the frozen yogurt. It always annoyed me how so many buffets dont even have sprinkles.. so theyve got that going for them.. though I think Ill just go to Mojo or Yogurtland. haha. In short, I dont understand how anyone can eat this garbage."
2,"This place is not that great. Shogun express has way better chicken teriyaki rice bowls and beyond. The chicken is what really bothered me here. It was really tough and extremely chewy. And that was the white meat. Theyre bowls are around 5 bucks which I like, but theyre not even filled to the top.  All in all I came here because Shogun was closed and there arent any other rice bowl places in Scottsdale that I know of. Eh."
4,Ive been to Joes & Bobby Qs but Daves takes the BBQ on this one! We got Daves family portions for one of our many tailgating experiences. We tried all of there dishes and the beef brisket was delicious as was the pulled pork. And dont forget the cornbread muffins. While this is a place you cannot go often or you will be the pig! Its worth the calories every now and then!!
1,"I purchased a pair of Naot Paris sandals ($160 with tax) at The Shoe Mill.  I considered buying on-line, but decided to shop locally instead.  I ended up paying more, but assumed that I was paying for the superior service.  I wore my new shoes to work on Friday.  By the end of the day, I had developed blisters on both feet near my toes and my ankles.  I was surprised because I had read many reviews stating how comfortable Naot sandals are and the salesman who helped me confirmed that I was buying the correct size.  Sadly, I took them back to the store the next day.  To my surprise, I was told that The Shoe Mill does not take returns.  I have never tried to return shoes, so it didnt occur to me to ask this question when I made the purchase.  However, as I stated, I expected full service from a high end shoe store. I will no longer shop at The Shoe Mill.  Its been three days and my feet are still recovering.  Its a constant reminder of how dissatisfied I was with my purchase.  I will definitely shop Zappos next time."
3,"Slices or Spinatos? When youre near Tempe Marketplace and dont want to miss the movie you are about to watch you should check this place out. Slices is more of a ""New York"" style pizza where as Spinatos is more of a homemade style pizza, and I dont say that with any disrespect. In fact, if I had to suggest one of the two places I would most definitely suggest Spinatos. Ill try outline my reasoning behind this choice. Slices just has their ""NY"" style pizza, and to be quite honest they dont even do it that well. There are tons of places in Phoenix that do ""NY"" style pizza, and a notable place is Venezias on Southern and Mill, not too far from Tempe Marketplace. Spinatos does have an ""NY"" style pizza and a Sicilian pizza, and the latter is actually pretty good. On a Friday night, this place gets somewhat packed for dine-in, but you can order ""eat-in"". So basically, you order you food, wait to be seated, and then shortly after being seated you can get your food. This worked out pretty well. The service is also good, and the staff are pretty friendly. Bathroom was small, one bathroom for the whole place, but it was clean and well kept.  The pizza was very interesting, we got a Sicilian ""Traditional Vegetarian"" pizza. Essentially, if you could compare it to another pizza itd be DiGiorno. Seriously though, the pizza reminded me a lot of DiGiornos frozen pizza. This place has a unique homemade feeling to it, and even the pizza. Im not saying its bad, its just unique. The crust is actually delicious, and I usually dont care too much about the taste of the crust, but this one actually tasted pretty good. The downside though is the way they served it, nothing to pick up slices with, and it was super easy for toppings to slide through the grill when it was warm. It became somewhat of a pain to handle the first few slices.  This place has serious selection issues. Lets see, pork, pork, more pork, and a little bit more pork, oh and a little bit of vegetarian stuff. Ok, so where does that leave kosher meat eaters? Not at this place. If you eat kosher meat, and enjoy it on your pizza, this is not the place to come. There is literally no chicken or beef available here in terms of toppings. This place is pretty good and moderately priced. My significant other and I shared a 14"" sicilian, and got waters which totaled to something like $15. Certainly not a terrible price, but for the price I think we could do a little better. I suppose if we wanna catch a movie after dinner we would visit this place, but it is certainly isnt on the top of our pizza visiting list. Its good pizza, it filled me up, it was tasty, but pizza is a competitive market."
4,Absolutely delicious food at reasonable prices. Only complaint is that they only sell cans of soda. This kind of meal requires a big old drink
5,"5 stars all the way.  Let me begin by saying that Im a big fan of the products. The store is done in very warm tones and the drinks are incredibly aromatic and these 2 things combines seem to make all my stress melt away when I step in the door.  Im not a huge coffee fan, but I can order some of the coffee drinks here. Im completely unable to drink the caramel frappuccino from Starbucks, but I cant get enough of the caramel ice blended from Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf. So now that weve established that I love the product, we can move on to the real reason this place gets a 5 star review--the staff. Ive never seen anything like it. If you come in 3-7 times someone will probably know your name and might even know your drink. Leila is the best at this. She knows peoples names, their drinks and if you come there often enough she even knows which car you drive. Shell see a regular customers car pull up and shell have the normal drink ready and waiting for them by the time they walk through the door. THAT is the epitome of customer service."
1,"We decided to hit up the ""Wine Down Wednesday"" that was happenin at Tastings courtesy of KYOT.  Heres what went wrong: The event is from 6-8 so we arrived just a few minutes (3 maybe?) after 6 so we could get a spot just in case it was hoppin.  We walked in and the hostess (she looks like shes possibly the manager or owner) asked if we were there for the event and then pointed us towards the back room where the event was being held. We walked in and there were about 7 tables and there were people at them all already.  Talk about early bird gets the worm!  We had to wait for about 3-4 minutes for the waitress to finish with a table to find out if we could sit on the patio for the event.  She said yes and that she would be right out to help us.  In the meantime another woman and her friend also took up at a patio table nearby. 20 minutes later the hostess/owner/manager looking woman came out and asked if we had been helped yet.  We said no and she left only to return with a small happy hour flier menu which she just handed from a distance and didnt even come over to our table.  I know youre wondering why I would wait the 15 minutes, but I really wanted to see just how bad the service was going to be and frankly, I just wanted some good $2 wine. Its been about 5 minutes and the same woman comes back with full, detailed menus and I asked if the happy hour flier was the deals for the event and she said yes and then asked if we were ready to order.  Um, you just gave us the menus 10 seconds ago... By now Im ready to just order and enjoy the meal deals from the event.  I look over the happy hour flier and I see some app deals.  They said there was a specialty appetizer menu.  Not so much, but whatever.  I can deal with that.  Then I see the drink section.  The claim for the event was $2 glasses of wine.  I was excited to try some nice new wines on the cheap, but again... not so much.  In reality it was $4 glasses of house wine which only consisted of three different wines that werent really what I was looking for.  By now, the other women that were outside decided to leave having had enough of this shenanigans.  We decided (after 30 minutes since we arrived) to go next door to Sprouts, get some apps, and have our own ""Wine Down Wednesday"" at home. I bet there are plenty of people that will have good experiences here and continue to visit happily, but this one experience has caused me to write them off for good (which I dont usually do after one instance).  I wish that I could actually review their wine and food, but the service was so poor and substandard that its not worth giving them my money.  I understand if the food isnt good at a restaurant - some are just better or more talented than others.  However, any business can and should have good customer service.  I think this is where the cliched line of ""if I could give them less than 1 star I would"" comes in... Oh yeah, and I slapped down a ""Youve been Yelped"" card as I left. Take that Tastings!!"
5,"We were here on Wednesday, 12/21/11. We had been at a Rubios in CA recently and was extremely disappointed. Not this time! Jacob was our order taker and was VERY courteous and professional.  My husband got two fish tacos that were a good size and yummie. I went with the grilled veggie burrito and man, it was huge and tasty! This is what Rubios is about!"
3,"DVAP.... You have to go at least once in your life. It really is a neat place with alot of history.  The service is great, it appears to be family run.  The food is good. Better then Dennys but not as good as Mimis.  I had the all u can eat of beef ribs, lasagna, meat loaf, cat fish, chicken, mashed and diced potatoes, stuffing, rice, homemade apple pie, etc and salad bar. I know I am missing a bunch of stuff they had but you get the drift.  They run specials on Prime rib and stuff so you might want to call to see what they are serving the night you go."
