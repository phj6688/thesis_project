5,"Stopped by here for lunch today... I saw the Burger sign outside and thought I would try it out. WOW!! This place is amazing. The owner/chef was taking the orders and was super helpful and friendly. I had a Paradise CHZ which came with 2 patties, smoked mozzarella lettuce, tomato, caramelized onion as well as cucumber. I also ordered  Sweet Potato Tater Tots I was blown away! BEST BURGERS IN PHOENIX!  Our bill came to $18 for 2 cheese burgers, 2 sides and a soda.  It was so amazing I went back for dinner. I bragged to much when I got home that my boyfriend just had to try it. I had the special which was a Roasted Duck Burger (2 beef patties, topped with roasted duck, caramelized onions, bacon, fried egg over easy served with duck au jus) By far the best burger of my life. My boyfriend got the Beach House (2 beef patties. roasted green chili, smoked mozzarella, pico de gallo and jalapeno ranch) He also ordered the seasoned fries. I dont care for fires and I think I could eat 3 orders they were so good. His was so good he ordered another burger.  For Desert we shared a Maple Pecan Bacon Milkshake, also to die for. I really think I need one of these every night. From the atmosphere, the music, the staff to the food every thing about PV Burgers was a hit. This is a must go!"
5,"I have been living in Arizona for 4 years and have yet to find a decent Italian Beef Sandwich, until now.  I even gave the same statement to the owner.  I had ordered an Italian Beef for carry out, and while I was waiting, I let him know my frustrations.  He gave me his card and told me to call him after I ate the sandwich because he wanted to know what I thought.  Well, it was FANTASTIC!  Of course, I called him back to let him know.   The service, and the time and effort put into the food cannot be beat.  This is what you get for a mom and pops type place.   There are plenty of other sandwiches and foods there too.  I cant wait to go back and try some more!"
4,"Wow! what a great meal last night. Kinda nervous to go back after being there a cpl of years ago for lunch and not loving it. BUTTTTT 2 words: Boiled Wontons. Order these and u will prob crave them for days. Spicy broth with boiled wontons in a light peanut sauce. I also ordered my fave, Peking duck. Very impressed with the quality and will be going back more. They do bring the food out superman fast so you kinda feel rushed but other than that, i see why they are sooo packed."
5,"Been here twice now and wish I could say more. The food is delicious, the set up is really relaxing and service is great. A great place to take an out of town guest. Happy hour menu has these amazing tofu tacos that I highly recommend. My boyfriend had the Pork tacos which he said were also delish. Definitely check this place out!!"
4,"Ive been here twice now for the lunch buffet and the second time I even brought a friend who was a foodie and both times it was great. They have a great selection of dips on the buffet, a few salads and many warm entrees to choose from.  I recommend taking a little bit of everything and if you follow my rule, you wont be disappointed. Everything is absolutely delicious and youll have fun guessing the spices in the various dishes.  If youre in the mood for some tasty middle eastern food, I would really recommend it. Its a little short on ambiance, but with flavors like that, whos looking anywhere but their plate?"
5,"We happened upon this location when meeting a friend for dinner.  When I showed up there was a line of about 20 people ahead of me.  i asked them to put me in first available and they said 15-20min and then 45min for a booth. Ok, Ill wait. Our friends showed up and my girlfriend had asked if there was a spot at the bar we could sit in the mean time.  We were there for about 10min already.  Thats when she said to us. ""Your table inside is ready""  she walked us right there and we were sat.  WOW!  that was quick! We ordered drinks and food.  I got these jerk chicken wings for an appetizer and holy cow, they were delicious.  For my main dish I ordered a garlic noodle dish.  It definitely hit the spot.  My only beef would be that it was hard to talk with so many people inside.  I wont let that affect the rating though. Awesome place!"
5,"We were here on Wednesday, 12/21/11. We had been at a Rubios in CA recently and was extremely disappointed. Not this time! Jacob was our order taker and was VERY courteous and professional.  My husband got two fish tacos that were a good size and yummie. I went with the grilled veggie burrito and man, it was huge and tasty! This is what Rubios is about!"
4,"This place is very cool! I went here after work with a sorority sister for drinks on a Friday night. Ended up staying for like 3.5 hours. Fantastic atmosphere with outdoor and indoor seating. Lighting is dim and intimate indoors with rustic seating areas and large booth perfect for groups getting drinks together. The outdoor patio is sectioned off in a covered area with tables and smaller seats while an uncovered area hosted seating for peeps who rode their bikes in. The drinks are pretty yummy. If youre into fruity, girly cocktails there isnt much to choose from, but for a more mature, grown-u beverage, youre in luck. Hit the happy hour (which sadly ends at 5pm). It gets a tad loud and it difficult to tell the wait staff apart from the customers because theyre all in street clothes but theyre very attentive and sweet. We ordered the fondu plate and it was great. Pretzels, sausage, apples and the cheese... perfect for sobering up a bit from those yummy cocktails."
3,"Best time to work out at this gym is in the early morning.  Went in the afternoon a few times and its usually packed.   This place has everything I need to work out. (threadmill, free weights, machines, basketball court, swimming pool, and sauna).  Rarely do I see any of the machines out of order/ broken.  Although the mens sauna bench was broken for maybe 2-3 months before they finally fixed it."
5,"Stopped in for Margs and appetizers. Had 2 house Margaritas......AM I DRUNK? Holy MOLY what do they put in those things? Food was great, drinks were better, Ill be back!"
5,"As much of a sweet tooth that i have (dark decadent chocolate is my weakness)..Toffee was never my thing ,never on my mind .. And then i sampled Goodytwos toffee ..wowzer ! Sweet and salty toffee is regoddamndiculously good ..seriously good ! They have a toffee topped popcorn ..these gals are killing me ..oh ,oh the twozels sinfully delish magical pretzel mix with kettle corn ,nuts and chocolate . Listen ,you cant put a price on happiness ,ha ha  Everyone i love is getting their stockings stuffed with a box of salty-sweet love from Goodytwos. Nothing more delicious or sexy ,ya sexy then a salty sweet combo ..it is a heavenly pairing ..Goodytwos has perfected this,worth every penny ! Rock on ladies !"
4,"I have had the opportunity to watch games at the Staples Center, and Honda Center in Los Angeles and Anaheim. Both are great arenas and are very fan friendly. Jobing.com is totally different, and thats not a bad thing! I really enjoy the arena is in the same complex with restaurants and movie theater. Great place to hang out before and after the game. Parking is great, I actually had a parking pass and did not use it. I just parked at the west gate parking lot. The arena was very easy to acess, and we had a great time. We will be coming back many more times."
4,"I eat here at least once every week since its close to my office, and they are always quick, tasty and reasonably priced.   I usually get one of the lunch specials (even the Chinese-sounding dishes have a Thai flair, especially if you order them with extra spice), but if youre hungry the house special chicken is well worth the extra buck, as are the Thai noodle dishes (the pad see ew is my favorite).   The wait staff is always friendly, the food is always quick, good and reasonably priced.  i havent had a bad experience in several dozen visits, and ill continue to call myself a regular."
4,"So im not here to buy spices or shop for sheesha, im here for food. Lots and lots of food. Luckily for me, Haji-Baba is known for tons of food at decent prices so I have a promising evening of stuffing my face without breaking my wallet. God, I sound like a really cheap buffet commercial. But really, to be truthfully, super blunt, honest-to-go-honest truth, Haji-Babas food is not the best in the world but it is 1) fresh, 2) good quality, 3) tasty and 4) cheap. I am sure you can find better Mediterranean food around town, but this place is really good on your wallet and fits my needs just right. And hey, 215 reviews cant be lying. THE PEOPLE LIKE IT. They like it a lot. I ordered the gyro deluxe (gyro with raw onions and feta cheese), a side order of hummus, Babaganoush (eggplant dip), tried my friends lamb tongue and a pistachio  baklava.  If you are feeling adventurous and want to try the lamb tongue, lemme tell you: dont. Really, dont. There is nothing tasty about lamb tongue. It tastes slightly like roast beef but the texture resembles congealed liver patee and the big chunks are really scary. The only positive about eating tongue? Infinite pun jokes about talking about it forever. Get it? The gyro meat was pretty standard in the Gyro deluxe sandwich, the best thing about it was the creamy fresh salty feta cheese. Its the freshest ive ever had and they really DO slap it on that sandwich, like a boss. The babaganoush was also very very tasty with the pickle and the black olive- however- i would have liked bigger pieces of roasted eggplant than a hummus-like texture. The hummus was just A-OK, it needed more of a PUNCH of flavor. Last but not least, the baklava is my favorite dessert in all the land.. so obviously I enjoyed it. Heavy on the honey and not very crispy on the nuts, but pretty decent nonetheless. In conclusion, only use the tongue in your mouth and not the one on the menu, get as much feta cheese as your body can process and buy a desert to-go. BAM, lunch is served."
5,"I LOVE this place! From the moment you walk up to the door, it is spotless. Sometimes you will be approached by an employee asking if you need assistance, majority of the time, you wont talk to one employee, which is great! I just want to go in, get what I need, and peace out until next time without the small chatter.  Their hummus is AMAZING, along with a few of the prepackaged meals. Their Creamy Cilantro Salad Dressing is OMG AMAZING!! Sweet tea... LOVE IT!!"
5,"Oh my gooooooooodness!  I love this store.  I have been a tea enthusiast ever since I received a cast iron tea pot for Christmas.  A few weeks ago, I purchased a Groupon for $20 worth of merchandise for $10 and headed over to the store.  The experience was amazing.  The varieties were intriguing, the prices were reasonable, and the owner was very knowledgeable and friendly.  Also, the layout of the store was appealing and inviting.   When we visited the store, we received a packet of tea for the stores 1st birthday.  I hope there will be many more to come."
4,"I was surprised to see that this place has such low ratings on yelp- it is one of my favorite Mexican places in the valley.  Favorite dishes include: mini beef tacos, Tapopo Salad (iceberg lettuce, cheddar cheese, chicken, peas, corn, beans, tomatoes and large amount of quacamole under it all), fresh salsa, and Tacos Al Carbon. All freshly prepared and wonderful tasting. If you have kids, ask to sit in the blue room by the fish tank - the decor is fun and mysterious and will keep young children distracted thru the entire meal."
5,"Marcellino and Sima are finally back after their yearly 1 month Italy vacation (re-opened September 10th)....and are we glad they are back!   We had a fabulous duo appetizer: fresh fig and prosciutto and the second was a filet (carpaccio) with shaved mushroom and black truffle!  Delicious!  Ive always been a fan of prosciutto and melon, but the fresh fig was tremendous! Marcellino also brought us a fresh black truffle cream for his crusty bread, mmmm, amazing.  I dont think you can get this anywhere (fresh), even here if you ask for it, but we were lucky to be in the right place at the right time! Pasta duo was tortellini with even more truffles and a wild boar pappardelle.  Best hand made pastas anywhere.  Perfect! Main course was a perfectly cooked filet with his mashed potatoes and julienned vegetables...and more truffles!  So right...so full!  Im so glad we had an hour spinning class before embarking on this journey! We ended up skipping desert and had some left over to go!  What a perfect Italian dinner paradise! We cant wait to go back for opera night...and of course we are waiting for his next wine dinner.  Best in the valley."
3,"This would actually be another 2.5 Star experience but I went ahead and rounded it up to 3 stars since I am in a good mood.  We came here after going to Chelseas Kitchen down the street which was super packed for the night.  I easily get annoyed with complementary valet parking because I hardly ever carry cash and feel weird if I do not tip the valet boys and girls but I digress.... The concept and look of this place is really fun and different.  I felt like I was in a modern barn.  We walked in and put our name on the list and was surprised that it is all done by an i-Pad and you receive a text message when your table is ready.  Good thing the bf and I remembered our phones or else we would have been out of luck.  The wait wasnt horrible.  We went to the bar and got a couple of glasses of wine, the bartenders didnt seem really in a hurry to help us which got me a little annoyed. We were seated in a cozy, and I mean cozy 2 top table right in a main traffic way.  My bf and I are not big people and felt uncomfortable in the size of the table.  I know you want to pack a lot of tables in a small space but at the expense of the customer?  Our waiter was friendly enough but not as friendly as he was to the group of women that was seated next to us.... nothing like treating all your tables equal huh? We ordered an appetizer, the zucca chips, which had a decent flavor but were a little burnt.  We ordered out main dishes which were a chicken dish and their version of spaghetti and meatballs.  The wait for the food wasnt bad either but I hate when you as the customer have to ask for a wine list because your wine was empty for 10 minutes but the waiter didnt ask if you wanted anything else because he was focused on the table of 5 women next to us sharing an appetizer.   I had the pasta and meatballs, which was meh.  The pasta was a little mushy and the meatballs really didnt have much flavor.  My bf had the chicken dish with spinach which he loved!  All in all the experience wasnt bad but wasnt good.  Maybe they are still working out their kinks but this place probably wont be high on my list to return any time soon!"
5,"This is Mesas best breakfast, hands down! This is one of my familys favorite Saturday/Sunday brunch places in the valley.  Crackers & Co. is great food at great prices and we always take out-of-town guests there when visiting! I was never a fan of eggs unless they were scrambled or in an omelette, but Crackers showed me the way to delicious fried and poached eggs!  The Eggs Benny is great, both Traditional and California-style. Their omelettes are huge and never overcooked (my fave: Spinach Mushroom) . The skillets are mighty tasty and really satisfying (my fave: The Vatican with eggs over easy). Try their French toast... its got great flavor and is delightfully crispy.  If you get a chance, try lunch there! Their soups are so scrumptious and the sandwiches are to die for! The Cream of Spinach and Artichoke soup tastes just like a bowl of spinach and artichoke dip, and they dont skimp on the artichokes at all! The Chicken Dumpling soup is seriously the best Ive ever had (Im not even a fan of dumplings!)! The Roma Tomato Chicken Melt is my favorite sandwich on the menu (such good flavor!), followed closely by the Drunken Chicken sandwich. Their burgers are quite good and along with their salads, they serve up a hefty portion! Beware though of 30 to 45 minute wait times on the weekends in the winter due to snowbirds flocking for breakfast. The wait times let up about 12:30P though, so its great for those who cant decide between breakfast or lunch!"
5,"Ive been planning a visit to the Public Market for some time now, and was downtown today so I finally stopped in for lunch.  I had the ""Friggin Chicken"", which was friggin delicious.  The market fare is counter service, but when I was ordering the cashier was very friendly and courteous and brought my food to me out on the patio. This was a very pleasant first experience, sitting on the patio reading a book, sipping my canned mint green tea, and eating my sandwich with a side of couscous.  The atmosphere was very relaxed and there were others nearby sharing a bottle of wine, or just finishing up their lunch with good conversation.  Speaking of the wine, there was an impressive wine and craft beer selection.  Ill be going back to sample the beverages very soon. On my way out, I stopped at the coffee bar for a latte, which was much more bold and flavorful than your ""Fast Food Coffee"" variety; a great way to finish off my lunch.  If youre looking for a quick, inexpensive, fresh and local dining experience, check this place out."
4,"I like this Sams. I get my eye exams/contacts/glasses here and some groceries. Its almost always pretty dead and therefore easy to get in and out quickly and easily. They dont have nearly the selection that most Costco do, but Ive never waited in line here."
3,"Finding this quaint location wasnt to hard... i like that there is a parking lot right north of the place... as well as street parking :)  you walk in the place and wow... its a completely different atmosphere... low lighting but in a calming way rather than creepy...  they have a DJ.. the music makes the setting but to be honest it was a little odd for my taste,,,  Our waitress was very nice and helpful... automatically served us cucumber water... (which tastes amazing!!) and then asked for our drink orders ... a good waitress can seriously turn everything upside down or completely make your visit ya know... its a pet peeve of mine.. customer service...  every table had a pink candle lit... pink lights hung above the chefs area... it was just so relaxing! the mirrors on the wall around this cool looking splatter painting... i was diggin it...  everything on their menu is served as appetizers... which kinda sucks.. they are all at least 6-12 bucks at least ... from what i saw.. and the waitress said that they recommend for people to get at least 2-3 a piece.... wow, on top of drinks.. its kinda pricey to me.. good thing we shared everything...  the lemongrass chicken (cant remember the full title) was amazing!! so good... the gyozo (dumplings) were alright.. a little too minty for my taste... we had this other thing where they bring you the hot stone and you cook your own meat... it was alright but the stone only stayed hot enough to cook the meat med rare... i dont like my meat to moo at me... so its was alright... but i prefer it well done...  the beef wrapped in grape leaves.. well i was soo excited to try them.. but was sadly disappointed... they were so fiery hot (spicy) that i almost had tears in my eyes... never did it say on the menu .. SPICY... after a server came over and saw us gasping for water.. he filled us up and said, oh yea those are pretty spicy... wow good thing i had my TUMS lol  over all  The atmosphere was amazing.....  the staff was fabulous...  the food... eh...  the menu is crap... if your gonna serve spicy food you should say its spicy! isnt that some sort of health hazard?!  and its kinda on the pricey side...  i think i would go back again... But i dont think i would opt to...  there are alot more dishes i would like to try... maybe a different location would be better?"
5,"Tacos, tacos, tacos......how can something so simple be this great? Having seen this place being featured on DDD we had to try it out and it was worth every penny! I have a thing for always trying the ""odd"" menu items so Ive tried the tongue tacos and cabeza (head/cheek) burrito and to me there is nothing better on the menu! This place is rather small which makes it perfect if youre there with some friends or a special someone! My friend loves the shrimp ceviche though I havent tried it myself. Go to this place for some great authentic, local and quite tasty food.......probably some of the best the east alley has to offer!"
5,"I have been going to the Matador since I was little when it was a little hole in the wall on 2nd Street.  They have always had great Sonoran style Mexican food!  Its always our go to place when we attend events downtown or have business to attend to. They also have the best hot sauce in town!  As far as the service,  the food comes out quickly and we never really have to wait long.  If youre downtown and looking for great food I would highly recommend this place."
3,"I came, I Kiltlifted til the wee hours, caught up with a friend who was in town for a few days and staying nearby. Decent enough bar, was able to talk above the music without yelling, no asshatness witnessed and they have Kiltlifter. Service was attentive, a team effort, yet a bit robotic. They seemed a bit overstaffed, and well , just bored. Did I mention the Kiltlifter?"
2,"I just moved to the area so use Yelp but was very sad that the experience here was not worth making a return visit.  The only reason I am posting is because it has not been reviewed in so long.   I did not like how the spa pedicure was one price and then things you would expect in a spa pedicure was ""upgrades"".  I want to ask for a pedicure and then lay back enjoy the chair and some reading.   After the pedicure, the woman left me in the chair for my nails to dry and think she completely forgot about me!  I would have left if she had put my flip flops on before painting my nails.  Their child was cute, but I do not go to get a pedicure to play games with other peoples children.   Then to top it off, when I paid she asked for my pin as she was walking away (again)....no pin, it was a credit card....usually this would not bother me but I was already frustrated at this point."
5,I love this place. It was so beautiful over the holidays with all the lights and garlands. I think the people who run this have a lot of pride in their business. The room was clean and the beds so comfortable. The decor is rustic but elegant at the same time. I liked how close we got to park to our room...super convenient. Lots of coupons given to us at checkin too. Great experience!
5,I highly reccomend this place. They helped my girlfriend and I figure out our taxes and deductions so that we could get the max refund. We both had been doing our taxes online and missing out on hundreds in deductions. Ill never use another online service to do my taxes again as long as these guys are here.
4,"Been going to Baileys for the last six months. Its an older crowd during the day, but at night and on the weekends the crowd id much younger! Bartenders are all friendly and the drinks are cheap, though they could be stronger. I highly recommend it!"
5,"The best fish tacos, period!  And I hate chain restaurants!"
4,"My sister in law and her fiance took us to Jimmy Johns after discovering it. The location is really convenient to us, which is great. I enjoyed my sandwich. The branding is a little intense. EVERYTHING, right down to the chips, is branded with the Jimmy Johns logo. Its all good but its a little crazy. The sandwiches are big and the cookies they sell by the register are huge! Prices dont seem too bad either. A nice sandwich stop."
4,"Family business bagel shops are my favorite.  I found this place through Groupon and decided to check it out.  The name itself intrigued me as Lox means salmon fillet that is cured.  I didnt go with salmon, but I got a honey wheat bagel with veggie lite cream cheese.  The cream cheese was freshly made with carrots, garlic, and celery.  It had a light taste to go with a healthy and hearty sized bagel.  My friends got croissants with cheese which tasted delicious as well.  The prices are very reasonable here and you can order bagels by the dozen."
5,Love this place! I think this is probably the best Chinese buffet out here! They serve quality gourmet food. And they have a full bar too. Place is clean and service is great. Would go back anytime!
3,"I like this mall.  Its in a decent location, there are lots of good stores, and the clientele here is bearable.  Ive always thought of this mall as just below Scottsdale, but without all the silicone and snobbery.  We went last weekend to kill some time and were a little surprised to see that it was overrun with screaming toddlers.  I guess I should have known that when the AZ temperatures tip past 100 degrees, we have nothing better to do then hang out inside air conditioned malls or hang out inside air conditioned movie theatres, take your pick.  Anyway, the store selection is pretty good here, I just wish they would add a Crate and Barrel and a LUSH, then I would never have to visit Scottsdale again."
1,"We were so disappointed!  We were on vacation in Scottsdale and wanted to try a Brazilian restaurant.  It was nothing like the one we have had home.  Actually it was completely worse than all three Brazilian steakhouses we have close to home.  I tried about 12 different meats and I think there were only 2 out of the 12 that were tender.  The rest were over cooked or hard as a rock.  We really wanted to love this place as I kept trying more and more of the meats as they came around hoping the next one would be better.  Besides being hard, the meats didnt have much flavor.  The salad bar was okay and I dont know that I would even pay the cheaper price to just eat from their salad bar.  This is sad that I have to say the highlight or our meal was the fresh bread and salami slice you get at the salad bar.  :("
1,"I was severely mislead by Frank As, ""Its hot, but the food aint bad."" review.  It was very cold and by far the worst food Ive ever eaten.  You would have to drag me here in cuffs to get me to return."
5,"One of my favorite brunch spots.  Not the cheapest, but you come here to admire the Arcadia families/couples coming into have brunch.  There is sometimes a wait but it is worth it.  I have a hard time deciding between the lunch salads and breakfast.  I usually cave and get the french toast or ginormous belgian waffle.  Parking is plentiful but it is on a weird corner in the strip mall, if you are going, look for cork and cleaver."
2,"This is the first time Ive had a bad experience at an Oreck store. My 6 year old sweeper suddenly began spewing dirt out. The bag wasnt close to full yet and it didnt appear anything was stuck. The sales associate without opening it up began to insist I needed a new roller brush for $40. When I showed him it looked fine to me and wouldnt that be covered by warranty, he got upset with me and began stomping around. I also showed him a warranty sticker from 2010 on the machine which stated that there was a new roller brush installed and also asked him to look up my Oreck warranty. He found my name in their system and then began shoving my sweeper at me insisting I just take it and leave then, since I obviously didnt trust him. This man was totally weird and his behavior and attitude felt very unprofessional.  I still like Oreck but do not recommend this store."
5,"I hate ordering flowers sight unseen, but needed a local florist for a sympathy arrangement. Rachel immediately alleviated any concern when we discussed what I wanted in detail, and she even emailed me a photo of the final arrangement.  Gorgeous flowers, same day delivery and reasonable pricing - cant beat that."
3,"Visited recently for the first time.  Enjoyed happy hour appetizers on the patio.  Cool place for outdoor dining, the waterfall added a nice background.  They offer smoking and non-smoking on separate sides of the patio.  Of course you know that if anyone is smoking, the entire area gets to ""enjoy"" the smoke.  Being a non-smoker, I would appreciate an true non-smoking area but being outdoors was too compelling to pass on this beautiful day.  Another small observation - the tables were too low for the chairs causing you to lean over to eat and the chairs were not comfortable at all.   We ordered chicken quesadilla & crab cake appetizer.  The quesadilla was made w/ green chiles and cheese, served w/ green & red salsa.  Didnt care for the red salsa but the green was pretty good, rather mild.  A side of sour cream was all that was missing here.  Crab cakes were ok, nothing special.  Served w/ a nice side salad it made a very good small meal.  A side of some kind of orange sauce (chipotle?) for the crab cakes that seemed really HOT to me - skip this next time please. Just based on the outdoor atmosphere alone, I would definitely come back again."
5,Its not a standard restaurant as it is in the middle of a grocery store...but thats just what it is get over it!  The food however is fantastic!  I ordered the samosa chaat...A samosa covered in chick peas and other sauces and chatney.  A delicious Punjabi snack!  The portion was very generous and the price cheap.  I also recently ordered a dozen samosas to bring home and serve at a dinner party.  Very convenient and good service.  I will be a regular from now on!
5,Excellent. Fresh and yummy!
5,Great decor. Great food and very good service. You have to try the pork belly pastrami. To die for! Their version of the Manhattan was very good. As for the main courses you cant go wrong with the scallops or the smoked duck. For dessert go with the black & tan pudding. Oh soooo good. Highly recommend this place.
4,"This staff at this United Blood service is first rate. Always quick and effiiant. They are always staffed and ready to go when I arrive for my appointment. Ive donated blood at this location 10+ times and have never had to wait. Of course, I cant encourage everyone enough to donate and donate often."
4,"If you are a beer snob, stay at home trying to make it yourself.  If you enjoy a decent local beer in an old chandler building with a nice atmosphere give this place a shot.  The owner used to be a brew-master at Four Peaks Brewery which is a local favorite in Tempe.   I am not a fan of the over-the-top Hops that a lot of folks enjoy.  A few of the offerings here have a bit too much bite for me.  The red ale was my favorite until they changed the recipe and over did the bitterness.  Right now I get a Sun Devil Ale when I go in and it is pretty good.  They will bring you a taster if you ask and will explain the offerings to help you choose.     The food is always good.  It is a bar so dont expect 5 star cuisine.  The fries are great and the sandwiches and salads are good as well.  I havent been disappointed with a meal yet.  Even when busy service is decent.  Enjoy the beer, watch the game and let it all unfold."
5,"This mall has all the upscale shopping that you will ever need. Just make sure you come here with your credit cards in check as you are bound to fall in love with something when you come here. They have some of the best department stores in my opinion, and if youre looking for that perfect dress for any occasion, you have tons of options to choose from. I love how clean and perfect this mall is!"
4,"Had lunch here with 6 coworkers and the server accomodated 5 seperate checks with no fuss. She quickly brought out two baskets of soft warm bread that looked handmade, along with pouring out balsamic vinegar and light olive oil for dipping. The server described the days special, but we all ended up ordering eight inch pizzas (a lunch only size.) I had bacon and chose to have it cooked in the optional brick oven for $1 extra (not sure why they offer it seperately, but exp. at other places made me like the way it cooks better than reg. oven.) It wasnt much to go on, but the food was good, the service friendly and efficient, and the everything was clean and neat. Recommended if youre in the area."
4,"Cibo is positively adorable.  I love the atmosphere.  I love the little house, and the yard.  I love the excessively busy yet amazingly friendly servers.  I love the iced tea.  I love the bread.  I love the Antipasto plate.  I love making ad-hoc bruchetta out of said bread and Antipasto.  I love the margherita pizza. Just on a Thursday afternoon alone, I dont think Id ever come with a large group of people.  It just doesnt seem like a wise life decision. Really? Its love overall.  Love, love, love, love.  When I can, Im dragging my family here."
2,"just wanted to chime in & say that this place is so vegetarian-UN-friendly its not even funny. I was dragged here with family & ended up ordering a chile relleno, which was just about the only meatless item on the menu, short of a fucking cheese crisp. it wasnt terrible, but this place is really just all kinds of lame. service was mediocre, food was mediocre. with as many awesome & authentic mexican restaurants as there are in the valley, theres no reason on earth to come back, except MAYBE to try a mango margarita."
4,"It is a nice place. Actually when i have just come in, everything seems to look normal. Nothing different frm other nail salons. However, when a lady did manicure and pedicure for me, she did really good service. She always smile a lot, and made you feel comfortable. I will come back soon and tell my friends abt this salon cause they did a good job."
4,"Had the pleasure of enjoying House of Tricks last night, for the second time in the past twelve months. With a party of six, I was excited to get to see a range of dishes and try out most of the menu via my dining companions choices.  The restaurant, found in Tempe near ASU, is not hard to find and houses both indoor and outdoor seating.  The outdoor seating is where we ended up last night and between the fire pit in the middle of the grounds and the abundance of trees/greenery, the setting works quite well.   Our party was seated immediately and without problem, the night was off to a solid start.  Our waitress, Jamie, was both friendly and courteous.  Jamie had a great understanding of the menu, the specials and especially the wine.  Her recommendations for multiple members of the party worked out perfectly.  Each person in our party ordered an appetizer and off we went. I had the pork belly, on Jamies suggestion. Other choices within our party included the salmon cake, sweetbreads two ways, and the scallops.  I thought the pork belly was great. It had a pea puree as a base sauce and some baby carrots that just killed.  The scallops were tasty and cooked perfectly.  The sweetbreads two ways were a bit of a letdown.  As a lover of sweetbreads, I have had the pleasure of tasting some of the best variations of there preparation. These were just not that great.  They werent cooked properly and the seasoning was lacking.  This would be the only lacking dish of the evening. For the entree, I had the pork osso bucco.  This was a real treat, cooked evenly, tender and tasty.  Other entree selections around the table included the ahi tuna, the salmon, and the duck.  The tuna was the standard seared variety on a bed of mashed potatoes.  Both diners who chose this selection were quite satisfied.  My companion had the duck and while she certainly enjoyed the dish, she found the duck slightly fatty.  All around, the entrees were solid and plates were cleaned.   With little room left for dessert, we ordered three selections for the table to share.  All were good and once again our plates were cleaned off.  The dessert best was agreed upon to be the homemade smore the restaurant produces.   All in all, this is a solid restaurant with a good atmosphere and good service.  I would eat here again and recommend you to do the same."
4,I was super excited to find a place in Arizona that has vegetarian pho! The service was just mediocre.  It met basic requirements without any friendliness. Very cost effective= CHEAP.
4,"Came here in a daze after not having slept for a loooong time and flying in to the airport with Dad; reminds me of the nice breakfast diners in Chicago, got the combo with turkey sausage (still greasy--defeats the purpose), eggs (always the same everywhere), french toast (more white bread, nothing too special but filling), coffee.  Nice atmosphere and no major problems, would be great for the weekend brunch!"
4,"While I am giving this restaurant four stars, I must start off by noting that the pizza here is mediocre.  If you want spectacular pizza in Phoenix, dont kid yourself that its at I-17 and Thomas.  Its over at Pizzeria Bianco. However, the other items on the dinner menu are worthy of a visit to the hood.   The Penne alla Vodka ($12.95) offers up pasta in tomato sauce with bacon, fresh basil cream and vodka.  It is an excellent starter to split with a dining companion and thats exactly what the BF and I do every time we visit this place.  The Cozze Posolipo mussels in garlic white wine sauce ($11.95) are also quite tasty as an appetizer.  The complimentary warm pizza dough they serve with an onion and olive topping is a nice touch.  For entrees, the Pollo Parmigiana ($14.95) is the classic breaded chicken breast with marinara, mozzarella and parmesan cheese served with penne.  The Lasagna della Casa with Bolognese sauce ($13.95) is very good, but the portion is a bit stingy for the price.  The BF often enjoys the Gamberi alla Pana ($15.95) that includes jumbo shrimp sautéed with mushrooms in a brandy cream sauce over a bed of fettuccine.  Please note that the brandy cream sauce is extremely rich.  Another tasty option is the Spaghetti con Salsiccia ($13.95) with mushrooms, bell peppers, onions and Italian sausage in marinara sauce with a touch of white wine.  The Cheese Ravioli ($13.95) is another great choice with the tomato cream sauce.  For dessert, be sure to order a Cannoli Siciliani ($5.95) as its the very best I have had in Phoenix.  The Tiramisu ($5.95) is good as well. The bad news is that this place is no longer BYOB.  For whatever reason, the management decided that a restaurant that seats no more than 20 needed a full liquor license.  I really hope that the investment in that spendy license doesnt lead to the undoing of this place.  Given that they dont even have a bar area and I almost never see anyone order a mixed drink, I think staying BYOB might have been a better choice for this neighborhood joint. The service at this place is also part of the show.  The waiter may well be manic as he will either be way up or way down for your visit.  The décor here is pleasant enough given the location of this tiny restaurant in a modest strip mall.  If you happen to need a trip to the restroom, you will get the chance to traipse through the kitchen. All in all, Pizza A Metro is ironically a great option for everything but pizza."
3,"Typical dumpy yet fairly clean little sports bar in a strip mall setting. Get your tires changed next door at Discount Tire and grab a few heinekins while you wait. Beware though, they call it coppers because it is owned and frequented by Cops and for some reason there are a lot of people missing limbs that frequent the place.?. hum. ho."
5,"Being my first review, there is only one place Ive always had a 5-star experience. Hoodlums is the ultimate music/cd/vinyl/DVD/used music store in the Valley. ZIA and Stinkweeds are a distant second in terms of selection, price and overall experience. Steve and Kristian are two of the nicest local business owners Ive ever met. They know a ton about music and the local scene. Theyll help you find anything you need. Tucked in the SW corner of Guadalupe and McClintock (next to Traders Joes), this is a special place to find that CD/DVD youve been waiting to purchase.  They also have a wide selection of used CDs and DVDs to are at bargin prices, be sure to check that out too!"
1,"Im sorry. Youre too busy to look up my club card information? Too busy too push the button to do the search, enter my phone number and click ok? I took the time once upon whenever to sign up for your card. And now, you cant take 5 seconds to look it up for me? Let me clue you in, the cashiers here have always looked it up. It always takes 5-10 seconds at most! Great customer service. Insert sarcasm here for the uneducated. Other Big Lots this hasnt been a problem. Just the one."
2,"It was an OK gyro for almost twice as much as the other places Ive been to. It had a ridiculous amount of mutton sausage (thats what ""gyro meat"" is, fwiw,) and was pretty tasty, but not as good as a $4 gyro at Ali Baba. The price you pay for location, I guess. This would have gotten three stars, but then it gave me indigestion all day and I couldnt eat dinner, so it loses some for that."
5,I recently stayed at the Sheraton for two nights while attending a conference in Phoenix. I was blown away by the services. This is by far the best service I have received while staying at a hotel in recent years. I received a room on the 15 floor. Room was what you expect from Sheraton. The view from the room really sucked!! I got the room with a view of the hotel satellite and communications towers. TV quality was good and room had Starbucks coffee. Room also came with a refrigerator. I would like to see Sheraton move to Nespresso machines. After a long day attending a conference was great to relax at the hotel lobby bar. The desserts are yummy. I didnt get a chance to try the restaurants in the hotel. Hooters and Starbucks are directly across the street. My work colleague used the gym. He said the pool was really nice and gym had everything you need. Next time!!! I would definitely stay here again!!
5,"Does anyone know why their regular subs are $1 more than all the other Jimmy Johns? Or is that just when its delivered, instead of charging a standard delivery fee? Ive noticed that with the other types of sandwiches too, and extras...the slim is $4 instead of $3.25, and extra avo is $1.75 instead of $0.75 Thats not going to stop me from ordering though :-) Still love their sandwiches...they make the best veggie sub Ive had. They load it up with veggies, whereas I have to ask for extra everything at a certain other sub chain and then they still barely put any on. Id much rather pay a little bit extra for Jimmy Johns :-)"
4,"As my roomies put it: ""Finally a Thai place in Mesa that I actually like."" ""This tastes like my Moms Thai restaurant in Utah."" Three of my roomies and I ordered the Panang Curry with Beef, Red Curry with Chicken, Tom Yum Koong, Spicy Chicken and 4 Thai Iced Teas. The curry was the right consistency, not watered down and too thick. And the best part was that it was just deeelish! What is great about this place is that the spices dont overpower the dish, and you can taste many different flavors with each bite. This little place seats under 16 people max. Its a definite mom and pops store that makes tasty and very reasonable priced meals. We chatted how we wish we hit this place up sooner because its one of the best tasting ones in the Phoenix area."
4,"This place defies being stuck in a single category. Their menu is a bit eclectic and my only regret is not getting to try more of it. This place was right around the corner from my hotel on a recent business trip. We liked it so much, we ate here a couple of times. Im sorry Alex P. felt that he was getting attitude. One of my coworkers asked if he could have the daily special from the previous day because he had liked it so much. They told him it wouldnt be a problem and fixed it right up for him. The food was good and reasonably priced. I was there in April and enjoyed getting to sit outside on their patio and enjoy the awesome weather."
5,"Even though the new place is limited on seating the food more than makes up the difference.   I took my wife and kids for lunch.  We had some pulled pork and beef brisket sandwiches, fresh made slaw, and mac and cheese made from scratch like mom used to make.  The kids gobbled up the mac and cheese.  The meat was definately cooked with love.   Gradys makes their own signature sauce in several varieties.  They sell bottles of it as well.  I liked mixing the Hot with the Super Hot to make that pork melt that much better in my mouth. I also noticed they do catering.  Ive had events catered by some other BBQ joints before, but this food is much better quality and I think I can woo the crowds with Gradys BBQ. I fully recommend stopping into my new favorite barbeque place in Arizona. Thanks for making good food Grady.  We all enjoyed it and writing this made me hungry for more."
3,"I hate being disappointed by bars bragging about their ""huge"" number of taps... while I cant dispute that they have 52 beers on tap, I can tell you that very few of them are worth drinking.. and that the prices here are on the ok to high side... I would never come back if its not happy hour or late night pricing. I asked general questions about not discounted pricing, nine dollars for a Manhattan made with Jack Daniels and beers ranging from five to seven dollars... if Im paying seven bucks for a pint at a sports bar in Tempe it had better be something from Russian River or a Stone anniversary brew... and a nine dollar Manhattan seems out of place... this isnt Scottsdale or a hotel bar.    Well the good news, Thirsty Lion is quite lovely inside, plenty of seating and dim lights, really not a bad place to relax and mellow out. Plus, the food was great, everything weve had has been very tasty, now its all been off of the happy hour menu, but thats the only time Ill probably be here, the scotch eggs are delicious and my main recommendation. Im hoping that in time prices will drop a bit and more craft breweries will get represented, but aside from the nice interior and spot on happy hour menu, Thirsty Lion just doesnt stand out enough to steal me away from Boulders or Taste of Tops..."
4,"I am excited about this place, even though I have not had many opps to try northern style Chinese food.  Think dough, and dont mistakenly believe its the same dough steam/cooked/fried/stuffed in different ways.   The kind owner lady proudly told me each of our 3 dishes was made w/ a unique dough recipe...  At first I was worried all the dough would overpower my tastebuds, until I asked for some dipping sauce... they kindly made me a black vinegar, ginger, and scallion sauce... that just upleveled everything.  Who knows if its traditional or not, but I implored the owner to start dishing this out when Americans like me (smiley face) come over and eat. The off-menu items are written on a small whiteboard sitting atop the freezer stuffed w/ to-go dumplings... luckily the folks there speak English, so Ill be working my way thru this secret menu and who knows.. this might go 5 stars! SW corner of Ray and Alma School, next to the JCC."
3,"I am a BIG fan of chicken and waffles and I will try it just about anywhere it is served.  I especially love it in the morning; when everyone else is ordering a light breakfast, expect me to go for the fried chicken. Lo-Los was just alright for me.   I liked the chicken, but I was not fond of the waffles.  They were a little too... thin?  Light?  I dunno how to describe it, but I like my chicken AND my waffles to have a little crunch.  And there was kind of an interesting taste to the waffles.  I cant put my finger on the flavor. I liked the atmosphere okay, but I probably wont be back. I know Mrs. Whites Golden Rule Cafe is not for everyone, but honestly I prefer the feel there.  It feels less ""affected"" by its customers, I guess.  For some reason I am finding it hard to come up with the words here, but Lo Los feels like it is the more popular cousin of Mrs. Whites... you know... the one with the Letter in Football. Anyway, I am glad Lo-Los is thriving...  Maybe I will try the Scottsdale location sometime to see if they have a different spin on things."
3,"While throwing a small get together, we were able to have a back patio with a buffet style table set up with some pretty tasty appetizers.  The chicken sqewers were delicious and smoked salmon was also tasty but something seemed to lack.  At the end of the day it was good and I wouldnt hesitate to go back, but nothing to make me a raving fan."
4,"Service, awesome.  Food, spectacular.  Price, unbeatable.  I cant tell you how many times this restaurant has saved my life.  Richard is very understanding when I come in completely hung over, and knows to put extra kimchi in my side dishes.   Also, in terms of the local ""$20 all you can eat"" sushi specials, this is the only place that ever pops into my head as  a place I need to go.  Their sushi chef if spectacular and super friendly so its always a nice time sitting at the bar. They have a special lunch menu that is served only during the week, so you can expect the dinner menu on Saturday and Sunday regardless of the time you go.  Both menus are amazing, its just that the menus are slightly different in their options so if you have a specific craving (and I often do) you might have to concede to something different once you get there.  Its mildly annoying, but the food never disappoints so I let it go. Try it, you wont be disappointed."
5,"The food is fantastic, the staff is helpful and the atmosphere is comfortable.  The food at El Bravo just tastes better than the food at any other Mexican restaurant I have been to in Phoenix, regardless of price. The cheese is amazing!  I love their flour tortilla flautas , crispy beef tacos, cheese crisps, enchiladas (I could go on and on).  I really can see no reason to go anywhere else in Phoenix for Mexican food.  I highly recommend El Bravo."
3,"For some reason or another this macys has a better selection of shoes than the one at Scottsdale mall. In the past year I found a pair of Calvin Klein sandals for half off, and they carry the higher end, younger brands- which is great Nordstroms selection tends to be for an older crowd."
4,"A bit pricey, yet one of the best breakfast sandwiches you will find.  Parking is slim."
4,"Let me first start off by saying I was skeptical.  I had no idea what to expect and after reading a ton of reviews, we thought we would give it a shot.  Located in an old converted home in Heritage Park right across from Pizzeria Bianco the place is small and intimate and just an experience in and of itself. Now for the food.  Where do I begin?  Tapas (small plates) style, and community (share) the experience is in ordering from each section of the menu. We started with the Kimci and Nasu.  The Kimci is a Napa cabbage cold plate that will rock your world; a little sweet, a little spicy it was a great way to start.   The Nasu is an eggplant with a bacon marinade of sorts on top and while I am describing it poorly it was truly delishous.  Amazing!! Next was the Yellowtail Ceviche.  This WAS OUT OF THIS FING WORLD.  Inexplicable but so, SO GOOD.   Next was 2 off the menu plates, chicken and Wagyu beef short ribs.  The ONLY REASON this place does not get 5 stars is 2 of the 3 different types of chicken were mediocre.  The wasabi grilled chicken was pure wasabi on grilled chicken.   The 2nd was a panko fried chicken, which was moist and delishous but nothing amazing, HOWEVER the 3rd chicken was an orange peel fried chicken that way just so good beyond words. Lastly, the Wagyu beef short ribs were so so so amazing, I mean, I never wanted the taste to leave my mouth. The service, very good Juan (our server) was very attentive and very helpful as it was our first time there...but it most definitely will not be our last...oh and THEY VALIDATE FOR PARKING ;)"
2,"With regard to AMber W.s points 1. Im rating the food not the containers or the owners 2. If it makes you feel better eating subpar food because of the American Spirit so be it. Others of us are more concerned with the food itself. 3. Im not downgrading it because its not a sit down restaurant. Even among non-sit down restaurants or ""fast food"" style Indian themed eateries, this place is subpar. Ive eaten at quick Indian eateries and they are much better than this. 4. My review is for people who understand and can appreciate good Indian food. Its not for people who value text service, nice containers and chatty owners. 5. I want to support mom and pop and locally owned restaurants but I also want to support good ones and not encourage bad ones to emerge simply because there is no competition for Indian themed restaurants here."
5,"Just open.  I had the roast beef sandwich and my wife had the turkey and stuffing sandwich.  Both were excellent, modern interpretations on classic lunches.  I highly reccommend this place. P.S.:  iPad driven POS system is way cool."
4,"Hey Guys,  This place is awesome....but I could be jaded because of all the wonderful wines I sampled! From the gris, cabs, sparkling shiraz, riesling to the chardonnay, this shop had what we were looking for and what we werent looking for! The atmosphere was amazing and quiet for a Thursday night get together. Our hostess was sweet and doted to our every need. The food was amazing. I completely recommend the crocodile pot stickers.  For exotic wines and exotic meats appetizers, look up Down Under Wines!"
4,"Every once in a while, you just need to enjoy good southern cooking. I was taken to Lo-los while visiting Phoenix. The Sweet Tea is served in a mason jar and comes with a diabetic attack. I had the Betty Bop - fried chicken breast and waffle. The waffle was really the stand out portion of the meal, but the two did work together. You dont have to get the chicken and waffle combo. But come on, dont be like that. We went Friday before lunch, and we were sitting and eating in 10 minutes, but from the looks of the other reviews, that isnt normal."
5,How could you write a bad review about a mountain?  Great sight to see.
4,"Clean facility, prices are super low! You cant go wong with saving money!"
5,"General Manager Scott Petello is a good egg!!! Not to go into detail, but let me assure you if you have any issues (albeit rare) speak with Scott and treat the guy with some respect as you state your case and Id be surprised if you dont walk out totally satisfied as I just did. Like I always say..... ""Mistakes are inevitable, its how we recover from them that is important""!!! Thanks to Scott and his awesome staff. Youve got a customer for life!! .......... :^)"
4,"Food is whatevers, drinks the same. However, this DnB compared to the one in Tempe is much better if youre really just interested in getting some game time in. The on at Tempe Marketplace is crazy busy, like 11 people waiting in line to play basketball crazy. When I go to an arcade and am already dropping 20+ bucks to play games I want that gaming experience to be nonstop. However, the drive is really far for someone that lives in Gilbert... so thats really the only reason why it gets a 4 star."
4,"Never had a bad meal. Just this week had the halibut ceviche special and as always the best guacamole (especially if you like garlic). The green chile stew was good, although I would have liked a bit more kick. Dined in the patio for the first time and it was great atmosphere. However it was a bit humid. Still a great experience."
1,"So a friend of mine went here last Friday, and they were double charged.  The bartender took advantage of the situation and threw out the receipt to avoid cancelling the $60 amount. Which she claims and assumes was her tip (on a $60 bill). ""I get a 100% tips!"" umm..yeah.. I think I will skip this place for sure!"
5,"This is one excellent Ethiopian restaurant, rivals anything Ive sampled in Washington DC or Seattle.  If I lived in Phoenix, this would be a Top-5 restaurant for me (along with Lo-Los Chicken & Waffles - yum!). Lalibela takes a slightly different approach to their menu.  Many of the entrees are offered as small portions ($4.50-$6.00 each).  They suggest each diner order 2-3 of these to make a meal. Kitfo and Lamb Tibs dishes are offered as full entrees and like many Ethiopian restaurants, you can order combo plates (meat combo, veggie combo, house combo plate etc.).  This made deciding on our meal a little more complicated, but also offered more flexibility for sampling different dishes. Our favorite dish ordered was the Lamb Tibs (the spicy version with Awaze spice paste).  Lamb was soooo tender, and the spices were a delight - rich in flavor but not too hot for those with tame palettes.  Good thing it comes as a full order - four of us were competing for bites!!  We ordered a half portion of Keye Wott (beef in a spicy brown sauce) that was some of the best Ive ever had.  Again, rich in flavor but not too spicy.  My favorite Ethiopian meat dish is Kitfo - choice beef sort of like steak tartar (servered raw or lightly cooked) but with Ethiopian spices.  Lalibelas was pretty good, just not transcendent like the Lamb Tibs or Beef Keye Wott.  The vegetable dishes were on a whole excellent - especially the yellow lentils, gomen (collard greens) and spicy (Wott) lentils. Staff was great - attentive, helpful service.  Unlike some Ethiopian restaurants, this one is very user-friendly.  Although in some cases  the menu accommodates American tastes it doesnt compromise on quality or authenticity.  One note on the injera (sponge-like bread used to scoop up the entrees) - its a mix of wheat flour and teff (a grain indigenous to Ethiopia) and I dont think its fermented like injera that is made with 100% teff.  Im used to the latter, but you can argue Lalibelas injera doesnt compete with the flavor of the entrees as much. All in all, one of the best Ethiopian restaurants Ive been to, and I have been to many in the States.  Only problem now is whether my favorite Ethiopian restaurants in Seattle will still taste as good!  Highly, highly recommended."
5,Being from Sweden you just like salmon and at Le Chalet you can get a delicous Nordique Crepe with salmon! Never had anything like that in Sweden! Besides the great crepe and friendly service from the owner Alain Keller I was also treated to a laughing experience. They have a comedy show twice a month. Great place to eat and have a nice relaxed evening!
5,"If youve never had or even heard of bingsoo you NEED to check this place out. I have two friends who were constantly bantering about bingsoo and this Fresco place. I was excited when I found out it was so close to my house. If youve never heard of it, this is how it goes down. Its a layer of shaved ice, then you have your choice of ice cream or FF frozen yogurt, your choice of fresh fruit off the menu (apples, strawberry, mango, banana kiwi and many others) and then your choice of ""sauce"" which is a fruit puree of either strawberry, kiwi or mango and honey. You mix it all together and there you have it. A somewhat healthy dessert! They even have a frequent bingsoo buyers card =)  This place isnt just all about the bingsoo though. They have a menu of fresh sandwiches and fruit juices too!"
1,"Im going to have to agree Whole heartedly. And i informed the manager of it as well. I picked this one because it was close to the Airport and the Light Rail. The noise from the Airport wasnt to bad. But it was the Train Horns all NIGHT LONG and ALL MORNING when your trying to sleep. I wouldnt pick this one, the neighborhood wasnt bad despite what people say. But the Train noise is just unbearable. I got it for the Click 6 rate which was reasonable. Stay Elsewhere. I should of picked one further down that was right off the light rail."
5,"Feeling yucky one day and wanting nothing but some reminders of my bay area asian food... My search began with my iPhone for Pho.. AND I wanted good Pho.. (Im skeptical of some dishes in the desert, just sayin!).. I drove a good 20min from my loft to find this place.. worth it. Usual toppings you will find with real Vietnamese Pho.. but awesome! I asked for a variety of tofu and seafood.. I couldnt finish it all.. but never can with Pho.. its a big bowl, and filling!  Extras on tables to get your Pho on..  Ordered the Vietnamese Shrimp Rolls too.. left feeling not so stuffy! AND full.. OH yeah, and I still had money for a bit of shoe shopping the next day... :-)"
5,"Love me some hidden house!  The music is too loud. The drinks too cheap. The clientele too local. But Ive never had anything but a good time there. Whether its karaoke or weird shit on the weekends youll have fun if you dont expect it to be Merc, cuz Merc it aint. And not for one moment in its life has it pretended to be. But I love it for what it is and thats an experience."
1,"This review is based on delivery, service and food quality as delivered. Second and last time I will be ordering from this place. The first time they forgot a few items and were very off for delivery time.  Tonight I Ordered at 11:03 PM, estimated delivery at 11:50 updated to 11:54 PM (from a whopping 1.5 miles away to add). 11:54 comes and goes. Call them, at 12:07 AM now, I am told they are on their way (1.5 miles away keep in mind). Call back at 12:40 AM to cancel my order as I do not want to eat at 1:00 AM. They actually come to deliver while I am on hold waiting at 12:44 AM. My ""hot sub"" is ice cold, theres nothing like the taste of cold greasy bacon and chicken close to 1:00 AM on a Monday (now Tuesday) night...if you are going to take nearly 2 hours to deliver this, at least make sure the temperature is somewhat close to where it is supposed to be....never again silver mine...never again. This place probably has a ""good taste potential"". Unfortunately, like most ""hot food"" the taste quality substantially decreases the longer it sits...in a fridge, alley, or wherever they decided to leave it for nearly 2 hours. If you feel the need to get food from here..for the love of sub kings please just DONT GET DELIVERY!"
4,"We were staying at a hotel nearby and found the reviews for this spot. Boy are we glad that we did! We are constantly on the hunt for great tacos in any city, this was definitely one for our list.  We ate here for dinner both nights we were in town. The majority of the meals ordered were the 3 taco plates. One carne asada, marinated pork, and carnitas, served with yummy rice and beans- the tortillas were very good too. This is definitely the plate to get here. I think that the carne asada ones were the best.  Normally we order all of our food medium spiced, but beware of the red hot sauce that they put on the tacos. My daughter somehow got an extra dose on her tacos and was having a hard time getting through the burn. This somehow justified the obscene amount of Frescas ordered. :) If you are remotely sensitive to heat, order your sauce on the side."
5,"Huge store, friendly staff"
5,"This is an adorable little gallery located in the middle of nowhere, Downtown Phoenix.  My art teacher friend got fixated on bringing me here when she heard me complaining about Phoenix being chain hell (and thanks to her and Yelp, I dont believe that anymore).  I think she chose wisely as I loved this little space.   It was a nice place to stop and check out, and then of course we had lunch at the attached City Bakery.  A perfect activity for a half-day of school!  Hooray creativity and uniqueness!"
4,"I like Pei Wei, its good when I want something fast. But the main reason for my review on here today was to say HOW AMAZING the manager was at this location.  I came in at lunch and it was VERY busy. There was a line to the door. There were some arguments about someone stealing a seat (unhappy customer, complaining because a seat was saved and they had waited in line, wanted to be comped because of it.... so dumb if you ask me. I mean just deal with it people! Its busy!) But the manager dealt with it so professionally, and when I was next in line he did not act rushed, he was very helpful, and told me that if I did not like what I ordered to just tell him and he would get me something new. I work in the restaurant business (a much higher priced place) and this manager was awesome! Good job man!"
3,"This was supposed to be my trip to have the best pizza in America. So imagine my disappointment that they dont even serve it at lunch. What human who eats pizza thinks it should only be served at dinner?  Whaaat?  I have since been kindly corrected by another yelper that this restaurant isnt the pizzeria. My party was confused, since the server said they DO serve pizza...at dinner. The soprassata focaccia sandwich was fine, but overpriced by about $3.  I dont live here to try it again, so the first impression is the only impression. Ill leave it to all you foodie hipsters to prop up the rating."
5,Love it!!! Wish we still lived in Arizona as Chino is the one thing we miss. Every time I think about Chino Bandido my mouth starts watering. If I am ever in the state again I will drive out of my way just to go to it again. YUMMY!
5,"Lets see...what is there NOT to like about Surprise Stadium? Well, $9.50 tall cans of PBR is about all I could come up with and thats not a surprise (pun intended) considering youre attending a sporting event...even spring training.  But as someone who does not living in Arizona, and as someone who doesnt go to MLB baseball games in Southern California due to the fact it costs so damn much, people bitching about the slow service or any other little inconvenience when it comes to seeing a game here. Look, youre lucky enough to have almost an entire month of low cost MLB baseball right in your back yard. If I could, Id live down here during March just to take in the awesome baseball action that crisscrosses the Phoenix metro area each year.  I attended my first spring training game on March 12th, 2012 at Surprise Stadium as the Royals took on the San Francisco Giants (my favorite team). Our seats (Sec. 112, Row J, Seats 13-14-15) were 25 bucks each (around 30 bucks including service fees). I mean, we were maybe 5 or 6 rows back from the Giants dugout (check out some of my pictures). The stadium (funny calling it that since it only holds just over 10,000 people) is big enough so you feel youre at an MLB game but small enough to feel pretty close and intimate with the players. The stadium is well maintained and kept super clean.  Arriving to the park, I was surprised (pun unintended) to see that parking was free, an oddity when going to an event like this. The stadium staff, as mentioned by other reviews, are mainly made up of senior citizens who were super friendly and helpful. I didnt have to wait long at the concession stands, even if lines were a bit long. The outfield is lined with a lawn area, perfect for people to sit back and have a picnic while taking in a game (Tickets are around 9 bucks each after service fees!!!).  I love this place and hope to return next year when visiting family. Oh, Giants won 2-1! Go Giants!!!"
4,"I like these sort of ""mom & pop"" spots, small and intimate setting.  Great pizza!  I always enjoy the veggie pizza with jalapenos, oh so good!  And mu hubby loves the suicide wings, but weve tried almost everything off of the menu and you CANNOT go wrong.  Prices rock too!"
4,"Yum!  even though it is incredibly heavy and bad for you- YUM.  we got the beef and hominy stew with fry bread and the ultimate taco.  lets start with the stew- though it was just beef and hominy, the broth was so tasty and delicious.  didnt even need the fry bread on the side.  the ultimate taco was pretty awesome- we got the red beef chili and then it had refried beans, cheese, sour cream, and lettuce.  it definitely wasnt gourmet but it was so delicious and so cheap!  gluttonous, but worth it.  we wanted to get a dessert fry bread, but we were just way too full to even go there."
1,"As I promised myself, Id go back again to try it again. Yyyeeaahhhh...sooooo....the food is still not good. I got the mongolian beef and its like ""wha? really? is this IRL?""  Im a chinese food kind of a fan, this restaurant, Im not a fan of."
4,"If your going to see the Phoenix Coyotes at Jobing.com arena.....or the Arizona Cardinals at the University of Phoenix stadium....then you you cant really miss the experience that is the Westgate City Center. Now it is not a spectacular mall by any means...and the parking is a bit confusing...but it does have its own flair and style. During the summer months it is the perfect place to go after a game or event at the stadiums...because you can grab some dinner....a drink...take a nice walk....or just hang out and watch the stars in the beautiful skies over Glendale Arizona.  The best part about all of this along with the close proximity to the stadiums.....is the parking is FREE....cant beat that. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"
5,"I love this Gelato! My favorite combination is the panna cotta with the mint chocolate chip. Weird but wonderful. I am rarely down this way, especially since Ive moved, but I still fantasize about digging in to this deliciousness!   I only ever had great service, and fantastic product here. So far it is the best Gelato Ive had, although I hear Arlecchinos is pretty fantastic as well. I miss visiting Angel Sweet, I will have to go back soon."
5,"Tucked on the western edge of the Foothill Acres neighborhood in North Phoenix or what I would call ""The Slope"", Try Me Bicycle Shop has been in business for nearly 40 years and has been collecting the odd part for every type of bike over that time.  The showroom is filled with cruisers and comfort bikes, new and used. No high end bikes here but they do have an inventory of old and hard-to-find parts, good service and free air that makes this place."
1,I went there with a friend last year after reading so many good reviews. The service is good. We didnt have to wait but I didnt like the food I ordered. I had a salmon with caper butter sauce. The fish is not fresh at all and the food is too geasy for me.
5,"Going to Desert Botanical Garden is the perfect field trip for a beautiful day like today... Ive been to DBG a handful of times for events, exhibit openings, meetings, and of course Yelp In Bloom (a yelper party that I planned a couple of years ago)... but today I went with my son and we met some other friends with the sole purpose of checking out the butterfly exhibit. We didnt get lucky enough to have a butterfly land on us, but we did see tons of gorgeous butterflies.  There were orange butterflies and yellow butterflies and striped butterflies, etc... The flowers in the pavillion are pretty to look at as well.  We visited the gift kiosk afterward and took home a butterfly finger puppet, which I know we will get tons of use from (only $6.25). The exhibit runs until May 13th, so dont miss it! And if you do find yourself with more time while youre there, definitely check out the design for a living world exhibit as well... I saw that when it first opened and it was really cool.  The photography alone is worth a visit. I just wish I had more time to explore DBG more often!"
3,"Weve been in the market looking for a church for the family to start attending. Chandler Christian seemed to be a nice offering since they are located fairly close to the house and have a decent size to offer something for each group (parents & children).  Ive gotten some good reviews from a family that I know that attends.  I LOVE that they have a service on Saturday, as that is ALWAYS a plus for me. The sermon for today was an interesting one, and it seemed to be relevant and on topic for today.  The pastor took an updated slant to the story to make it a bit more relevant to todays time.  My husband was even laughing at the pastors jokes.  My mother-in-law even commented on how she liked the music.  I did notice that the verses that they pulled up were not the verses that I remember.  I believe its due to them using a different version. All of this being said, the service seemed to be a good one. The signage indicated that this was non-denomination; however, the service reminded me one Baptist services from childhood."
4,"Now accepts plastic!  Now accepts plastic!  Did you hear me?  Harveys now accepts plastic! Ive lived around the corner from Harveys for a little over 4 years now.  I had lunch there once in the mid 1990s, and went in to watch a Suns playoff game a few years back when my friend was decked out in Spurs gear and we were nearly lynched at Half Moon.  Quick lunch with a girlfriend who was in the mood for a burger about a year ago.   While I love, and I do mean LOVE a good dive bar, this place scared the crap out of me.  Im young, not hideous, female, and not of the meth-head variety - so not only did I not blend, but I felt targeted.  Sad, really.  The ONE bar within easy drunk stumbling distance from my house, and I wasnt happy going there.  During a weekday for lunch was more or less okay.  But evenings are when the freaks come out.  And I dont mean the freaks like me.  I mean the dangerous crazy ones - not just the fun crazy ones.  Theres a difference! Well, enter the new roommate.  He was disinclined to believe my review, and insisted we go.  I resisted until late Saturday night, when he came home at 1am and insisted I get dressed so we could go there for an hour.  Maybe I was tired.  Maybe I needed a change of pace.  Whatever the reason, I gave in, got dressed and we walked over to Harveys. YAY!  According to Echo, the bartender (yes, its her real name.  her parents are hippies like mine), the owner has been working hard to improve the place (read: clientele) for over a year.  It shows!   Echo is three shades of awesome - the perfect gal to be running the bar!  Easy smile, quick wit, great sense of humor and the talent to mix a great drink while cooking any of the grub from the menu.  She is a one woman show and pulls it off like a champ! June drink specials included $2.00 Beam 5 Star bourbon, Yukon Jack, and I dont remember what else.  I asked for a bourbon and coke, the roommate asked for his bourbon neat.  (Brave - cheap bourbon *needs* to be cut with something!).  The pour is solid and consistent  Oh, and did I mention you can get a mixed drink, anytime day or night for just two bucks?  For $2!! Two drinks for me, two shots for him, a beer chaser for him and a cheese wineburger split between us.  Under $14!!  Holy hell, its cheaper to drink here than it is at home! And at home - we dont have the entertainment of the other patrons.  Like Cowboy who would do the splits on demand.  And suggest my roommate go through the needed steps for a game of ""rodeo"" with his girlfriend. You just cant make this up! Oh - and he bestowed slightly drunk me with a new nickname. Apparently, I am a ""prick ass bitch.""  I dont know how he meant it, but I am taking it as a compliment and will wear it with pride! Oh, yes.  I will certainly be back!  A LOT."
2,"Gary Betz, DDS with Southwest Dental Group in Phoenix (Ahwatukee) Dr. Betz was nice, but the office...well it seemed to be the unfriendliest, coldest dental office Ive ever been to (out of 6-7 in my lifetime). I used to complain that dentists offices were too full of perky, chatty, overly friendly clones, but now I miss those offices. I saw nary a smile or warm greeting - businesslike efficiency seems to be the norm here. Dr. Betz was friendly and smiled, however. No complaints about him, other than my feeling that everything was rushed. We didnt go over my history or much of anything, but well see if the next visit is better.  Postscript: After getting home from this appt. and reading the horror stories on various review sites relating to ALL Southwest Dental offices, I changed my designated dentist and went to Foothills Smiles instead. Please see my review of Foothills Smiles on Ray Rd."
5,"I have lived all over the US, and I have experienced extreme lows and highs with dentists, but this dental group is by far my favorite I have ever been a patient of. I cant say enough good about them, so I wont ramble.... Just love them."
5,"I honestly have only positive things to say about Postinos since every one of my visits here has been very pleasant. From the valet who is running his ass off to the food and everything in between, this place does it all right! If you go here hungry, you should know that your options are basically a panini, a salad or some bruschetta. Ive had a little bit of everything and for the value and quality you cant go wrong the the bruschetta. I recently determined my favorite to be the ricotta, dates and pistachio but a close second is the salami and pesto. Wine by the glass can be a bit steep so if youre planning to stay for a bit and can agree on a style with your company, you might be better off getting a bottle. A bottle is pretty much 3x the price of a glass so you end up getting 1 1/2 glasses extra. Bonus! Someday, Ill actually take advantage of their $20 deal for wine and bruschetta!"
3,"This was the perfect place for the family after a day at the resort.  The food was good, especially the barbeque chicken.  The kids menu was wonderful.  My only complaint was that the server really could not answer questions about the menu."
4,"This was our third visit and I have to say the service is impeccable. They are attentive, friendly and helpful.  I cant remember what we had our first visit, it was right after they opened and during the awkward stage. The second visit we had pizza it was good, we were looking for deep dish which they dont make but it was good and great service.  Tonight we all had different things: Mostaccioli for my older son he was very happy, cheesy and flavorful sauce. Spaghetti and meatball off the kids menu for the younger boy, sweet sauce and a big meatball another happy boy. Husband had the Chicago Grinder hot and it was gone in a flash and he said it was really good. It looked great on the toasted bread. He also got a salad instead of fries, lots of fresh veggies. I had the Italian Beef with peppers and onions, it comes with Giardiniera and au jus and french fries. The bread was yummy soft yet substantial enough to withstand au jus. The bread was stuffed, stuffed with meat, the peppers and onions were good but the giadiniera made it. It was a really good sandwich. San Tan Brewery on tap - yum. I could give them 5 stars but Ive had better Italian Beef though I will admit Im not an expert.  A great dinner and I hope to return soon."
5,"Kids love Disney, and so do I.  One of my favorite things at this location (as opposed to the AZ Mills location) is the magic princess mirror.  Grab any of the princess items (shoes, tiara, wand, etc) off the rack, and wave the package with the UPC symbol facing the jewels and mirror, and after a few seconds, that particular princess will appear in the mirror with a little story for the kids."
5,"Hertz Gold Club service worked perfectly for me. My Toyota Corolla, booked over the internet, was in its bay and ready to go. The buses to and from the rental centre were frequent and painless to use."
4,"Being a fan of the infamous Roscoes Chicken and Waffles in Long Beach, I was totally down for some chicken and waffles this morning. The bestie found this place because it was close to my new home in Arizona and was sure to be a hearty brekky after all the physical exertion of packing, moving and loading/unloading a Uhaul. So off we went... The place is easy to find and pleasant to walk into. The staff was friendly immediately upon arrival. Service was quick and attentive. The menu is simple but appealing...so are the prices. We decided to go with the traditional chicken and waffle plates to satisfy the savory and sweet tooth. Waffles are big, maple syrup is warm and the chicken is perfectly southern fried.  Im afraid I have to admit that I may now be thinking of LoLos first whenever I hear chicken and waffles. MmmMmm!"
1,"Let me first say that we are fans of the W Hotel and have stayed in many of their hotels around the nation and are overall happy with the accommodations and customer service.   Im a local Phoenician who resides in the Arcadia neighborhood and frequents many of the wonderful restaurants and hotels this City has to offer.  After hearing MANY negative reviews from co-workers, family, and friends, my fiancé and I decided to give the W Hotel Scottsdale a shot prior to forming an opinion of our own for this hotel/restaurant/bar. During a night out on the town with visiting and local friends, we opted to give this place a try.  Upon approaching the entrance of the bar, security tells us that were not welcome here due to one of the members of our party not having closed toe shoes and another not having a collared shirt.  The attire our group was wearing was more than appropriate for any Phoenix/Scottsdale restaurant/bar.  Let me remind you thats is July in Phoenix, and over one-hundred degrees at the time of night we went to the W and the six of us just finished a dinner at an adjacent, popular restaurant.  The staff was flat out rude to not only us, but others in line wanting and willing to spend money and support the local hotel. I will strongly suggest not staying here or supporting the quality of business they are running here.  During a time of a slowing economy and tourism, many businesses are forced to rely solely on the best possible customer service to attract and retain business--the W Hotel fell way short of this. I was very discouraged after our experience here and will agree with the many other reviewers that this place in not worth supporting.   Phoenix/Scottsdale has many great places to experience, so dont settle for this place."
5,"This place gets it right from the moment you walk in the door. Signed baseballs jerseys and bats by legends on the wall, a friendly host to greet you and when you sit down they ask if you want free chopped liver. It comes with bits of egg and onion, warm rye bread and bagel chips.  Our waiter, Jeff, was friendly and attentive, even lending us his flashlight to read an old newspaper story in the rafters. The cream of mushroom soup made from scratch was superb. Our mains were baby back ribs, the specialty of the house, cooked perfectly with a flavorful sauce. The broasted chicken was to die for: moist and juicy with a crispy outer skin. The fries were piping hot, as they should be. And the portions are beyond generous. We topped it off with key lime pie, light and tasty, an ideal complement to the meaty mains. And the bill was under $60, an amazing deal. As a bonus, some of the players drop in during spring training."
4,"This place is a good go to when youre looking for a mexican infused panda express.  Haha.  Yum!  I got the combo meal with the Jade Red chicken made into a quesadilla and the diablo chicken.  Really good!  I also got jerk fried rice.  The beans were also very good.  Yummy in my tummy.  I really enjoyed Chino Bandidos, but dont think I could go more than once during a trip to Phoenix (Id get very large from eating like this!).  :D  Oh yeah, if you want something more than a snack, dont just get a quesadilla by itself.  My poor brother thought the quesadilla would be huge and good enough for his dinner (thinking taqueria size), but it was pretty sad and small.  Luckily, my combo wasnt that small and I had extra food to share."
5,Yen has amazing sushi. I would say that they have the best sushi in AZ. You have to try it to see how amazing it is. The service is great and I feel like I just stepped into Japan. The whole sushi experience is very authentic and perfect place to hang out with friends or take a date :D There is only one thing I dont like. Sometimes it gets to busy so make sure to get there early (around 7 P.M) if you want to be seated right away.
3,"The pizza here is average. Its not bad, but its not the best pizza Ive ever had, either. Was it worth $9.75 for a 12"" personal pizza? No. I paid with a Fox Restaurants gift card, so I cant complain too much about a ""free for me"" meal. I would probably not come back again if it was on my dime. Also, my pizza was a little bit burnt on the crust. It was edible, but I was surprised that they served me slightly burnt pizza at the price of $9.75. My fiances wasnt-- in fact, they remade his entire pizza and didnt even send it out to us because it had a hole in the crust."
3,"We made the trek down from northern phoenix to get some authentic ramen.  I wanted to love this place and I wanted it to be worth the trip, but it just wasnt.  The decor is as previously described - you sort of time warp back to the 80s but it is clean and well loved by its owner.  They do have a lot of authentic menu items and a great kids meal, but the ramen was just not that good.  Its downfall was the broth.  Hubby got the salmon chirashi which was also not that fresh.  If Im in the area, I may give it another try for the don-buris."
5,"This is probably the sweet I crave the most! Salted Butter Caramel! Yummmm! When I cant make it up to Scottsdale, I stop by my local Whole Foods in Chandler and pick up a pint from the freezer section and it is just as good."
4,"This Gamestop is nicely stocked and it is very clean.  When I checked in here, I was picking up a copy of 007: Blood Stone.  It is currently on sale NEW for $9.99.  A fantastic price!   Heres the catch.  I tried their ""Pick-Up In Store"" service, in which you pick out the game online, you enter either your Rewards Card Number (which I have), or you enter your Credit Card number, just to make sure that you arent making a bogus claim.  Then you can go ahead and pick it up right away in store. BUT.  They gave me a USED copy of the game, and wanted to charge me $22.95!  Are you kidding?!  I just saw the ad online, and I reserved a NEW copy for $9.99.  The last thing I want is a colossal mix-up... I dont know how they could have messed this up.   This place would have gotten a 5 star rating, but with the colossal mess up with the pickup, I will only give them 4."
4,"A group of friends and I decided to check out Vincents Saturday Market this past weekend after a beautiful morning hike had worked up our appetites.  When we got there, the place was packed (but still had space to accomodate our group of 6).  It was the perfect outdoor market feel, with fresh vegetables from the garden available for purchase, next to organic lotions and soaps, and all sorts of food stands to whet any appetite (crepes, tacos, paninis, etc).  There was even a mimosa stand, where for $20 you could purchase a bottle of champagne, a glass of OJ, and as many plastic cups as needed.  This is definitely going to be added to my list of favorite places to enjoy a beverage while observing some extremely entertaining people watching!  I loved it, and hope to go again soon!"
1,"Cummings took over the company that we originally used, and since they have taken over we have had nothing but problems. I havent seen a single bug in years in my house and as soon as we started using Cummings weve found a bug almost every single day and not just bugs but cockroaches. I called Cummings to ask them about why this was happening and the receptionist was extremely rude saying they didnt do anything wrong. I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone.  Needless to say I will be finding a new pest control company today."
4,"Ive been to a few Schlotzkys around the valley and this one is actually surprisingly one of the nicer ones.  Its clean with plenty of space for even the largest working group lunch.  Service comes quick, and they have this southwestern sandwich that is great! If youre one of the many people who work for a large company on the Dunlap corporate freeway, this is not a bad place to grab a bite before the second half of your work day. One quick tip - its kind of tough to find, but its a stones throw north of Dunlap on the frontage rd.  You have to go back and around a building to find it though."
1,"Tried a couple Tammie Coe cupcakes and a mini muffin two weeks ago... Unfortunately for them, I also sampled Ollie Cakes... No wonder Ollie Cakes, aka Urban Cookie, won Cupcake Wars and Tammie Coe sits in high rent selling pretty sugar disguised as a cupcake. Drive a few miles north, get whatever the special cupcake of the day is along with a Brown Velvet and Lemon, and save saying you enjoyed Tammie Coe for impressing snooty folk who wouldnt know yummy if it bit them on the butt! Really, the TC cakes were just cakes... No flavor, no texture, dry... And I cant say how impressed I was that the clerk shoved all my selections into one, tiny, flat bag meant for cookies or sandwiches!  Apparently presentation and flavor preservation mean nothing... As their products now do, at least to me."
4,"Ill admit I almost fell outta my chair after hitting a triple-double on the Malibu. Quite generous pours plus delish menu. Cant wait to go back and try out the dance floor!!! Did I mention the Disco Ball?? Yeah, baby!"
4,"Sure, Ill pretend that the main reason I come here is the food and not the super cheap margaritas. It was the... uhh... food that is really good even if I dont remember what I ate. I think there were some fish tacos that were pretty tasty. Okay fine, I go for the margaritas- they are big, cheap and tasty."
3,"Im sad to say that I wasnt in love with MacAlpines.  The fact that the building has never been restored is cool, in a dirty kind of way.  The floors will never be clean enough, because they are so old.  That may seem ridiculous, but cleanliness is important to me when Im eating somewhere. Our server was odd, but helpful and attentive.  We spent a good amount of time oogling the random items displayed throughout and were entertained with our surroundings. The food is where I saw the problem- my Mac Cheeseburger was bland and tasteless.  My broccoli and cheese soup was below average.  I wasnt impressed one bit. We ended up having dessert.  I opted for a single scoop of Chocolate Malt Krunch, which Id never had before and didnt love (total personal preference as my friend loved it).  MacAlpines is cool, but I think purely as a place to get something sweet."
4,"Had a very nice meal in there on 5/10. Bengan bartha was tasty and the only poor part of the meal were the nan breads, they were not at all fresh. Good prices though and good service and Fullers ESB to boot!!"
2,"This place bothers me.  I already everything about country so going to these kind of places freaks me out.  I was forced to go here because the boyfriends parents were in town and they choose Cadillac Ranch due to their type of ""cuisine"". I have to say the foo d wasnt bad.  Server messed up my order but when they got it right it was ok.  I will not go here again however.  Sorry."
5,"I dig the breakfast been to 7th and 38th and had Nans breakfast, Plus have had tamales too so really is something to come back. In 13-years (I live in Cali) been here 26 times and not fancy (although 7th is the one with great pottery and colors inside. I ate 1 time for lunch of dinner and 25 times for brekafast"
5,"I had lunch there recently and was very impressed with the food,  friendly service and excellent value.  I had a lunch special -- two cheeseburger sliders with sweet potato fries.  They serve the burgers with several pieces of fresh crisp lettuce, tomato and onion.  We will definitely go there again."
3,"In the office, Fiesta Burrito is aptly known as ""across the street.""  Kind of like, ""How about across the street?""  ""Yeah, I could do across the street, today.""  If I ever said, ""How about Fiesta Burrito?""  I would get, ""Wheres that?""  Then I would have to say, ""You know, across the street.""  And the response would be, ""Well, why didnt you say so in the first place."" The primary reason we eat at ""across the street"" is because it is convenient - its across the street.  And in the immortal words of my most quotable co-worker, ""It is fast, cheap, and good -- no questions asked.""  The part about it being good is debatable.  I could do with a little less greasy.  Fast, no question.  And despite that fact that ""across the street"" charges 60 cents for spicy carrots now, the prices are low.  I like the chorizo plate with a side of sour cream, although I might start branching out as we eat at ""across the street"" way too much, and Im getting tired of always having the same thing. At just above a dive, I would call it a hole in the wall, but really, it is just a generic Mexican joint that hides in plain sight.  Even the name is rather plain as no one can seem to remember it.  There is a smallish, generic inside dining area, which is accompanied by a small, generic patio for outside dining.  Some high school students seem to come by for lunch leave.  The staff is polite.  Until they move or I no longer work across the street, Ill be a regular."
1,"So far my restaurant experience in Phoenix has been subpar when it comes to service and this one took the cake. Everytime the server came to our table it was just to do one thing and we would be left in the lurch with our mouths silenced in the middle of asking for something. Finally the food came and it was actually quite delicious, I ordered the turkey eggs benedict with potatoes and fresh fruit. However once again the food was dropped off with no silverware, no condiments and no refills on the coffee. I truly hope the restaurant re-trains the staff or hires a whole new batch, because I am afraid food alone can not keep a business afloat."
4,"Been there many times with many friends, not fancy food but decent, fresh, local, organic at a good price with none of the pretentions that one would associate with the whole organic/green mocvement in dining. That being said the food only gets 4 stars based on the price plus the 5 star brownies...food is above average but not by much, the atmosphere and price are what i enjoy most"
5,"I am disabled with MS. The heat of summer about does me in, esp. in the car. Because of this, and because the best thing Ive ever done for myself was to buy an electric Hamilton-Beach water kettle, I drink TEA. All day. Loads of it. Teavana is MUCHO EXPENSIVE, though I adore it. I learned of the Tea District through somebodys ad and like them very much as well. But, I had no idea we had a genuine tea company in Phoenix. And because of HomeRun, I was allowed to buy THREE vouchers. And because DragonFly is so awesome, they let me use all three to buy tea online and have it shipped to me all at once to avoid huge s&h fees. It should be here any day, and I cant wait to try their Cab(ernet) against Teavanas Opus Rouge. I love red heavily tart, fruity teas. It doesnt matter to me if there is no white, green, or black tea in it. In fact, I prefer it to just be the fruit. I drink it hot, and then as it cools all day in my tea pot, I keep refilling and either warm each huge travel mug with lid in the microwave, or drink it room temp, or even add some ice if it is particularly strong. I can EASILY drop $150 at Teavana, or $120 at Tea District and just touch on what I most want. With your three vouchers worth $60, I got to try two bags of every flavor I most wanted, except Peach (as they are out of it, but Holly wrote me several times and made recommendations based on what I had in my cart).   I know I will love it, and go back to order the Peach when it is in stock again. Thank you so much for finding a local treasure and making it accessible.   Sincerely,   Judith Ann Hillard President of Addiction Overcome, Inc., a non-profit foundation Author of The Other Woman at the Well www.addictionovercome.com"
2,"I planned to order chocolate truffles from Truffle Trolley for our wedding favors.  We ordered the sample box to try them out.  They came in about a week and they were packed on ice which was really nice.  However, when we tried them, we just found them WAY too sweet!  We didnt like them so we are looking for something else.  Just make sure you try the chocolate before you buy to make sure you like it."
4,"This place has good fast food, its always clean, and the staff is super nice. SUPER nice.  My kids love the play area and its a lot cleaner than any other fast food play area for sure. We love this place."
3,"We had a large group and they honored our reservation with having the tables ready at our specified time as opposed to getting them ready when we arrived. We had a somewhat set menu.  The tofu dumplings were delicious. Satay chicken was alright.  We had a choice between 3 entrees. I want to give them higher ratings for their service, but the spiciness between the dishes were very inconsistent. You get to choose on a 1-5 scale and finding a dish that suited your desired spiciness was a hit or miss. Some peoples 1-2 were super spicy and others 4-5 werent that spicy. (note: 5 is spiciest)  Also, we had a huge mess with the bill where they put all the appetizers onto one bill for a table, and none on ours. It was quite a mess trying to figure that out. Also, their timing for food was so bizarre. By the time 1 table had basically finished their dinner then the rest of the meals arrived.  Then again, dealing with 40+ people is a lot."
1,"I was really disappointed with my local Baja Fresh tonight.  The lobby, salsa bar and even drink station were very dirty and unkept.  To top that off my salad had old dark colored guacamole and limp lettuce. I hope they read this and will do a better job at cleaning up!"
5,We love Dr Steve!
2,Good service. The waitress was friendly. but the food was just icky and the Place smelled bad! like sewage pipes. I had a glass of wine. there was no way I was going to order a mixed drink while she was tearing the bar down.  I didnt feel good after eating the food. I had a coupon so it made the total bill cheap. But i would have walked out if I had to pay full price because The atmosphere they boast should provide better food. No Not good dont go
4,"Went to Sticklers for the first time today, with a friend who works across the street.  Im a little leary of places that get talked up so much, but Sticklers was everything she talked about and more.   A family friend once told me that the way to tell a good restaurant is how busy it is.  Seems like common sense now, but how many times have you walked into a restaurant with less than 10 people in the whole place and then walked away disappointed? Well Sticklers was packed.  My first impression was ""Crap, the line is 20 people deep and we only have 40 minutes for lunch...theres no way""!  Well I was pleasantly surprised when we got through the entire line, food in hand, in about 5!  The guys and gals that work there are efficient and have it down.  And they showed some great patience for a newbie. The chicken salad and provolone sandwich was outstanding and the hot peppers gave it a great kick.  Word of warning to the lactose intolerant - its a 2-piller!  The atmosphere was active and lively but not overly loud.  We were still able to have a conversation without shouting.  I just wished the people at the next table realized that.  We didnt need to hear about their daughter ""wrongly"" accused of DUI...for the third time!"
4,"This restaurant is truely cultural experience in your mouth---Chinese, Mexican with a dash of Jamaican. Pollo Diablo is fab! Mom and Pop place with some true TLC that goes into the food. The beer and wine was a good selection as well!  Way to Go!"
3,"This goodwill is Alright, I have been to better. Their selection is okay, cleanliness is okay and organization is okay. All goodwills prices are the same, as far as I know. The staff is helpful and I never have trouble finding somebody if I need help."
4,"I go frequently because every day, from 2-4pm, 44 oz. strawberry limeades are on ""happy hour"". But more importantly, chunks of more or less real strawberries come up the straw into your mouth. There are also real limes down in your gargantuan tankard of ice crunch and sweet sweet nectar. For a dollar.  Sometimes I get something big and fried at Sonic and it makes me feel a little gross, but on the whole their food is great if you can handle its intensity of flavor. I should note that I have a very fond memory of eating bacon cheeseburgers (and the aforementioned strawberry limeades) there after a hard days work, but that could have been the heat and poverty of the Tennessee county in which I was day laboring, or my avid youth, or the sheer novelty of my new southern surroundings. I do stick more to drinks and desserts if I go here though. Total Americana - theres a lot of junk to pick through, but you can make your personal choice for something special. I chose limeade."
5,"Five stars is truly deserved For Yasu. This is truly the best sushi in town and some of the best I ever had! I am a big seafood lover and there a lot of ""chain sushi"" places in Arizona that are decent and good for rolls, but if you want quality and authentic Japanese style fish and incredible Sashimi, you need to go to Yasu. There is really no way to describe it till you go, but once you do, you will become an instatnt fan!  Best thing to do is sit at the sushi bar and ask Yasu to make whatever he wants! You wont be disappointed.  The area and building are misleading... However, if you are the kind of person that thinks RA is the best thing since sliced bread and nothing can beat it, this is probably not for you. This is real sushi... Go try and enjoy!"
5,"Spotted Donkey Cantina is amazing!  They have delicious Mexican food, and fantastic margaritas to wash everything down with. You do have to pay for chips and salsa here, so there probably wont be any of that four bowl snacking before your main entrees come, but the medley of salsas it comes with make it all worth it. Ive tried quite a few of the dishes here, and theyve all been excellent.  In no particular order are my favorites: cheddar enchiladas with hatch chiles and rice...spicy! santa fe macaroni and cheese...again- spicy! cod and shrimp tostadas- delicious! shrimp fajitas shrimp tacos And for dessert: fried banana wraps or the mango margarita sundae!"""
5,"If you buy half a duck, you dont get to pick which duck. I lived in China, mainly Guangdong, for three years, and all it really took was a look at this sign, along of course with all the wonderful roasted ducks and pork, to know I had come across a place with bona fides.  Hope Kee has some of the very best Chinese food in town, in my opinion, and is worth the trip from wherever it is in the valley that you live.  I dont know anywhere else in town you can get such good congee, which is actually called ""zhou"" or ""jook,"" and which is a soupy, delicious rice porridge.   Theyre also one of the only places you can get dried scallop soup, which they do an excellent job of.  Dried scallops, a specialty of HK/Guangdong, are one of the most delicious things in the world.  Everything that they make is delicious, and sitting in there listening to the customers and staff talk in Chinese and Cantonese can really take you back to China, if youve had the pleasure of spending time there. Otherwise its just about as close as you can get.  If you want to eat some real Chinese food that is both delicious and approachable, and very reasonably priced, you cant beat Hope Kee.  Get some soup or some congee, some clams with black bean sauce, some greens and some BBQ, and youll see why China and Hope Kee are such hard places to stay away from.  If you do decide to try your hand at duck-picking and buy a whole duck, fear not for wasted leftovers, because roasted duck makes for a very tasty soup."
5,"This is the old location. For current reviews, look up Karens Kreamery Cafe. Here is what I posted for the new location...please give it a chance. I do not know the owners, I just love supporting a good, local business... Great ice cream, super cute store, extremely CLEAN! The ice cream is good, service is always great, and the location is fun (although a little out of the way). The prices are reasonable. I would rather support a locally owned business and pay more than McDonalds prices and less than Cold Stone prices. If you havent been, and plan on visiting in the Summer, bring suits for the kids. There is a nice little splash area right next to a big playground. Karens Kreamery is located in a big park/sports facility. There is also a medium sized skate park. We usually make a fun outing out it. My family loves this place!! Support local businesses!!!"
4,"Ahi tacos, rib tacos and ribs are all good but a little overpriced. Service staff is always top-notch. Both the beer and wine lists are good, mixed and specialty drinks are nicely done."
2,"When I heard about this place I was really excited because it is hard to find really friendly vegetarian food in Tempe.  The atmosphere here is great and very sunny.  It is in a strip mall which takes away from it a bit, but the inside has a funky feel to it.  I always want to like the food, but something is just off every time.  The black bean burger is good, but it comes on an untoasted piece of wheat bread that gets all soggy and falls apart.  Everything else is OK, but why do they do that.  It makes it disgusting.  Put it on a bun like normal people."
4,"Great food and very knowledgable/helpful staff. A little expensive, but the food is definitely worth it Have had pasta on one occasion and salmon on another....loved them both. Will definitely be back to support this great restaurant!"
4,"It was a busy bustling little town perched atop a small hill between the mighty Superstition Mountains to the east and the Goldfield Mountains to the west.    The first gold-strike was made in 1892, and it took just a little under a year before the town came to life. One rich strike after another supported the town and approximately 4000 people who lived in the district for five rich years.    The town boasted 3 saloons, a boarding house, general store, blacksmith shop, brewery, meat market and a school house. Just when it looked like the town would outgrow Mesa, the vein faulted, the grade of ore dropped and the town died a slow painful death. After several unsuccessful attempts to reopen the mines, the town did come to life again from 1910 on and off until 1926."
5,"I grew up at this library.  And now I am old and married and hope to someday take my very own kids to this library.  They have a great selection of audio books.  I am a major audio book fan and this is the place to be!  Clean, safe, you are not bothered by stranger dangers.  I dig this library."
2,"Okay now this is a large chain and on average its okay to good!  and I have been to this place many, many times, but I have to say the last time I went there for the happy hour hot wings (they were dry, over cooked) then I had ordered a steak and seafood combo (Cajun) something but after my second brew I thought it was me, so I had the wife and my son taste it man was it salty!!!!  It tasted like they dropped the salt shaker in the food, but my waitress assured me that could not have happened ""because all there sauces come in bags and are pre-made"" (Gross, that did it for me) I  was outta there with the quickness..."
3,"I am a sucker for a theme restaurant. I have been wanting to visit this place for a while because of their whole gimmick. When you arrive a nurse checks you in, gives you a hospital wrist band, and dresses you in a hospital gown. Seriously, I love a gimmick more than the next person but the Heart Attack Grill is 100% gimmick and only 60% good food. The menu consists of burgers which vary only in the number of patties, french fries fried in lard, shakes, pure sugar coke, and PBR. They have a strict no sharing policy which completely bummed us out because we wanted to order the huge 20 patty burger and split it 3 ways. We ordered 2 single bypass burgers (one of our trio boycotted the burger because of the no sharing policy,) all you can eat lard fries, a vanilla shake, full sugar coke and a PBR. The burgers were ordinary, the fries were ordinary, and the service (aside from being dressed as naughty nurses) was ordinary. The only win was the delicious butterfat filled vanilla shake.  The bill came to around $30, which is a bit pricey because remember only two of us actually had food. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it. It is a gimmick. Heart attack, fat, lard, waitresses dressed as nurses, cook dressed as doctors, sugar, beer...whatever. It gets old pretty fast."
5,Had a celebratory lunch for a colleague today. We had a group of ten. Service and ambiance were great. I had the best burger I can remember. It was Lons special burger; expensive at $16 but worth every penny.  Highly recommend.
2,"If youre into smoke that reeks all over...this is the casino for you.  It sure aint Vegas where you dont smell any smoke.  Peeee---uuuuu!  Stinky. And if that wasnt bad enough:  I went with a group of friends and we all ate at the buffet.  Now, in all honesty, some of the food there was pretty good:  the shrimp, the prime rib beef, the stuffed cheese lasagna, etc. Some was pretty bad like the ceviche  and the desserts--OMG--how bad they are.   My cheesecake was, obviously, a day or two old and had that refrigerator slightly hard crusting over it--plus, ever so slight smell from the fridge. Not yummy.  The pies were alot of filling and few pieces of fruit.  Just cheap desserts, so stick with the meat and fish. Here is the coup de gras, tho.  I was given a $4 comp on my players card.  I went to 3 different machines and they were all BROKEN!   Finally I find one that lit up green so I knew the players card was working. And guess what?  The $4 comp money never showed up on the card. If this Casino thinks I would actually spend money to sit in their stinking cigarette smoke loaded casino, they have another think coming.  Hell no! I also had a ticket to see their Showstoppers ""show"" which, if it sucked as much as their slots and crappy old desserts, I figured it wasnt worth it. On my way out to go home, I pitched both their non-working players card and their ticket to the ""show.""  I knew I would have more fun watching reruns of Sex and the City at home than boring myself even more. Goodbye, Casino Arizona.  You have alot of people in that casino so youre making money off some sucker...just not this sucker. Never again. (2 stars because their fish and meats were really good)"
4,"Well this is truly a hidden gem in Old Town Scottsdale. The wife and I visited this establishment last Sunday after church. There is usually a long wait here...but we arrived about 10 am and there was no wait. We were seated very quickly and the service was very good...there was a little wait for our food but no complaints about that though. I had 2 great buttermilk pancakes, turkey sausage, eggs, potatoes, and hash...the price....only 9 bucks plus tax...a really great deal. So if your ever in Old Town Scottsdale and need a great breakfast to get your day started...visit this establishment. Eat, Drink, and Be Merry my Friends!!!!!"
4,"This was a brand new experience for me, but so much fun!  The staff was very patient and helpful, and we felt perfectly safe after some one-on-training even though we were all newbies.  Only complaint is that the beginners walls were a little crowded, while there were a lot of super advanced walls not being used.  May want to swap the ratio to match the customer base.  But a very good time and an amazing workout.  It may be days before I can lift my arms again..."
5,"Heres the deal. I said I was done with OT, but a friend told me the management had changed and it was worth another shot.  My friend was right. Everything I had a problem with before was remedied. I went in unannounced, didnt tell anyone about a previous bad experience, and I was given some of the best service Ive received in town. When we went in, we were sat quickly and tended to very well for our entire visit. No texting employees, no indifferent waitstaff. The chef was in the food window expediting food, making sure it went out promptly and correctly. Not only was our server attentive, but there was a team service atmosphere and other servers came by our table when we had empty drinks, debris on the table, etc.  The decor has been refreshed, and although I didnt dislike the decor originally, it is definitely an upgrade as well. Now its much cleaner, but still maintains the character that was part of its charm before.  Props to the new management. Well done. Ill be back. PS - forgot to order side syrup. Curious to see if they still charge $2."
4,Went and got some delicious Boba today. Mango and Strawberry Banana.  Guy behind the counter is very welcoming and friendly. :) My choice place for quick to go Boba.
5,"a G Spot is a myth.  and Dr Graffenberg was a mad scientist. So its no surprise that I couldnt find the Gelato Spot either.  Shannon spouts, ""I love gelato so much, I would bathe in it"".  Hmmm, thats interesting I drove in and around the dirt road ... and went up and down Scottsdale  ... explored the box ... looked south of the landing strip at Scottsdale Airpark ... manually googled it ... orally asked the passerbys Road several times and I couldnt find it ANYWHERE Maybe I need to do more research.  Perhaps some field research...Or a targeted focus group *** UPDATE  *** Its on Shea Blvd??  No wonder I couldnt find it- I was looking down the wrong road *** UPDATE  *** Thanks Jake P for ""Yeah it is on Shea, in the strip mall area east of scottsdale rd near the Harkins Theater and Pita Jungle and such.... "" BUT the point of this review was sarcasm.  i.e. g- spot is hard to find *** UPDATE  *** Now I have a girl, ""Shannon W"", telling me where g-spot is.  She writes,  ""Its on 74th St. and Shea, in between Coffee Plantation and Pita Jungle."" Shannon W:  The point of this review was sarcasm.  i.e. g-spots are hard to find"
3,"You have to know what youre looking for to find this place.  Ive passed this location several dozen times and never realized that a restaurant & bar was located underground.  A friend of mine invited me to have a few drinks and some dinner and I was intrigued, so I decided to go for it. We sat at the bar and ordered glasses of Wine and some Oysters.  The bar was packed, but we were able to comfortably enjoy our food and have a conversation.  The food was OK.  The Wine was the house Zinfandel, which was *eh*....but I didnt like the call options, so whatever.....now I know not to order Wine here. Overall, it wasnt too bad of an experience.  Next time, Ill go with a Beer instead of Wine and try sitting in the dining room. Return Factor - 80%"
4,"Ive been here three times once for lunch and twice for dinner. Lunch was pretty crowded, dinner not so much but tons of take out. Prices are cheap and food is good!  I love the beans and I recently tried the guacamole and loved it. Try it out and see for yourself."
5,"I put forth that we need to institute a new standard of measurement to be used for comparing coffee shops.  Furthermore, I think that Cartel Coffee Labs should use this place as a standard for this new unit of measurement. I have to assume its called a ""Coffee Lab"" for a reason.  Too many coffee shops these days are retail stores, where coffee is an incidental thing in all the yelling, stupid names, and fancy colors.  If you look at the menu of Cartel Coffee Lab, there are a total of 13 items.  Its all about the coffee, plain and simple. Then again, theres really nothing simple about it to those who take their coffee as seriously as this place does.  The artistry of their baristas is not to be trifled with.  These people can make a latte so pretty, you really wont want to drink it (until you do, then youre happy you did).  On top of that, the selection of coffee varietals is impressive.  Ive only tried one, but that alone was better than anything Starbucks tries to pawn off on the masses.  Perhaps the use of the term ""Lab"" is because theyve actually stepped beyond anything any other coffee shop has done.  Either way, the formula that they came up with works better than anything Ive come across before. Then again, maybe Im being too hard on the other places.  Its not that they have an intrinsically inferior product, but the reason for these places has been lost behind t shirts and mugs and open mic nights and selling you a card containing the same money youd use on the place anyway... I digress.  Cartel Coffee Labs is a great place with a fantastic product.  If their WiFi is weak or the back corner gets dark, I honestly dont care.  Their coffee is excellent and Ill be coming back for more."
4,"Had myself a new york striploin and it was quite good although I do hate paying these kind of prices for steak.  I really thought the vegetables were more special than the steak, but if you compare what kind of quality steak you get here compared to say Donovans (high quality steakhouse in CA), Ive got to say that I like the overall package presented at Keg Steakhouse with respect to the quality and price."
3,"I moved in here a few ago and I do like it for the most part. The grounds are kept clean and tidy, except for some irresponsible pet owners. Some of them even let their pets run around leash-less or cannot control them. But that is not the managements issue. Pros: 1. The apts are spacious, well-built. 2. Grounds are clean and grass is maintained. 3. Pool is well-maintained. 4. Online system for rent pay and maintenance tickets is great. 5. Price is great for the value. Cons: 1. Apts not sound-proof or heat-proof. 2. Sprinklers tend to sprinkle more water over the sidewalks than the grass area. 3. Covered parking is extra $$$ and not enough of them anyways. 4. Uncovered spots are all just crowded in the parking lot at the back. 5. Security gates are open most of the time from the front and have gaps that could let an adult through on the sides. 6. Outer compound Walls are not high enough to actually prevent/make it difficult for an intruder. 7. Fitness center is adequate at best. Most of the free weights and equipment (except the machines) are broken or missing. The machines work ok, but are not maintained well. 8. Leasing office employees could use a bit more smile and inter-personal skills."
4,"Why pay full price for mens clothing when you can find quality used items here? Well Suited consistently has an excellent selection of suits, sportcoats, slacks, dress shirts and golf shirts. You can also trade in your old clothing for store credit or cash. The credit is good at any of the different stores in the My Sisters Closet chain, including all of their stores that carry mens and womens clothes, furniture and kids apparel, furniture and toys."
3,Pretty tasty dogs.  Pretty long wait for a hot dog.
4,Sometimes you just gotta have a burger.  I was in the Scottsdale Rd/Grayhawk area and noticed this place where Nicks used to be.  I tasted their burger at the Scottsdale Culinary Festivals Burger Battle and thought it was really good. The CB&CB burger with tater tots really hit the spot for lunch.  The burger and carmelized onions worked together really well.  The tater tots were delicious. Overall it was a satisfying meal and Ill be back soon.
4,"I think half the fun of a used bookstore is the treasure hunt.  This used bookstore is better organized than some of my old haunts in Dallas but I will survive. I think of used bookstores similar to looking through your Grandmothers attic at her book collection - it isnt supposed to be all shiny and new. Bookmans has a decent selection of books, Ive found an entire collection of Rishdie one afternoon! Of course it is always going to be a crapshoot but that is just the way it is in used books."
3,"My husband and I tried this place out since it is fairly close to our house and gets decent reviews.  I drank, my husband ate.  The wine selection is ok and the staff seemed friendly.  My husbands dinner was okay.  Id probably give this place better reviews had they not attempted to give themselves a $15 bump on their tip.  Id also probably give them better reviews if the manager would have called me back after leaving a message with a staff member about the charge especially when I left all the details necessary to fix the issue and was promised a call back that afternoon when the manager arrived.  Now, I can only assume it was not an inadvertent mistake since they give me no reason to believe otherwise.  I really would rather not have to keep calling back and chase my $$ down. Edited review - took them from 1 star to 3 stars since I received a phone call today from a manager and was advised it was a mistake and they credited me back the funds.  Also will be sending me a gift card for the trouble.  Overall, I appreciate the follow up and their efforts to fix the issue and bring me back in.  I was routing for them since the patio seems like a pretty chill place to have some drinks and unwind."
2,"This place is great - IF YOU LIKE TO BE IN A SNOBBY ENVIRONMENT!  There are not too many places that Ive been to that are more hype than anything.  But this is one of them.  When you try to go to THE PINK TACO, its impossible to find a parking space.  Once you make your way to the front, the hostess is always too busy texting her friends than interested in helping the customer!!  If you are lucky enough to find a seat at the bar, you better have a rolex watch on or you will not be served quickly.  Either that, or you better be a Hugh Heffner spouse.  I tried the burrito and was grossed out by how rubbery it was."
4,"My husband and one year old son dined here on a Saturday night. Service was great, food was delicious, and the BYOB was much appreciated! Staff was very accomodating with our baby. :)"
1,My brother also posted about our Mothers Day experience. These must be franchises because the Scottsdale and Chandler locations are like eating at a different restaurant entirely. This is the second and last time we will frequent this location. The pizza and calzones were awful.
5,"I was truly impressed by the quality of service and the knowledge of the employees. I have had my ears pierced at Claires when I was 4 (way to go, Dad!) and an industrial piercing performed at Club Tattoo. I went in to adjust my bar bell for my industrial piercing and they explained a lot of things I had no clue about, like the difference in threading. The place is clean and every one is friendly. I will ONLY ever go to HTC when I need to handle my current piercings or want to get another. Thank you!"
5,"Beer is awesome (first timers must do the beer flight sampler) and I have never had a meal that wasnt excellent!   A quick note, there isnt a/c in the building so keep that in mind during the summer months - although that doesnt stop anyone from going, the place is always jumping!"
4,"The workers here are SO friendly. The minute you walk in the door youll here a ""Hello, welcome to paradise!""  and if you stay to eat/study/chat youll probably hear it every few seconds. I love coming here to study. They have lots of chairs and booths that welcome it and the staff, of course, does not care how long you sit.  Food is decent. There are better bakeries in general but I can say that their cookies and salads are worth trying."
4,Breakfast is fantastic.  Work on the coffee selection.  Only thing holding back a star is no French press coffee or an espresso machine
2,I dont know how this place stays in business. The menu is so limited. Would you like chicken or chicken? Chicken in a pita? Chicken on some lettuce? Chicken rolled in a tortilla? And the pita chips are bland! Yuck! And  the potato salad has something in it that is way too tangy. Ive only been twice and tried different dishes both times but I just dont get anything greek about this place.
2,"So I have been to the location in Tucson and now experienced this one and I have to say that I did not have a WOW or YUMMM drooling moment at either. Dont get me wrong its not horrible it just has no wow factor at all to me and I will pass next time. There is just better Mexican cuisine out there,,, Service was promt though!"
4,"We had my husbands birthday party here.  The staff could not have been more accommodating.  They made everything easy! Our friends loved the place and the band (ReGroove) and had a wonderful time.  Drinks are well-priced and very generous.  The owners and staff truly want customers to be happy, comfortable, stress-free and to have a good time!!"
5,"Heres how to do Pizzeria Bianco the right way: 1. Show up at 3:30 or earlier to get a good place in line. Make sure you bring some friends to enjoy the time together and the great food. 2. At 4:00, the bar opens. Get yourself a bottle of wine and make the best of the 90 minutes youll spend just waiting to get on the seating list. 3. Order a few appetizers from the bar; theyre light and fresh and yummy. 4. When you finally get seated for dinner, dont hold back. Order salads, share different pizzas, and have a coffee after. The quality of the food is ABSOLUTELY worth the wait. We tried eating here a few times over the past couple of years, but realized it takes commitment and two bottles of wine to make it through the line. Best pizza Ive had since Italy. Bravo Bianco!"
1,"I was looking into gyms around the area. Upon entering I was greeted by the front desk guy. I asked about memberships and then he said, ""Sorry we are sold out"". I stood there stunned. Then he snickered, ""Just kidding"". Trying to be a good sport I went with it.  Next came the young sales guy. He was personable - at first anyways. Showed me around the gym and I was interested in joining. Next we went over to the childcare area since I have a little one. Children were in the room however the two girls monitoring the room were chatting it up with one another and ignoring the kids. Bad sign. I asked the girls if they were CPR certified and had fingerprinting and background checks. The world stopped for just a moment and they stared at me. I had interrupted their important conversation. Then they were both saying, ""Yeah, like, well, um, no, I mean yes,"". In other words, no straight answers.  We sat at the sales guys desk and the wheeling and dealing began. I felt like I was purchasing a new car. ""If you choose option A, you then can go to all the gyms."" ""If you choose option B, then only here"" . The whole time I could see the childrens area and the kids were being completely ignored (and we are talking very little children). When I told the sales man I needed to think about it he switched into some type of Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde routine. ""Well you only have today to make a decision, after that no price guarantee!!!""   From there he was down right rude. I walked out of there thinking what the heck just happened. Like Sarah G, I felt horrible when I left this gym.  It was an awful experience. Ended up getting a membership at Tangible Fitness on 7th Street. They dont have the same amenities however it is locally owned, and the people are very nice there."
1,veerrrrrryyyyyyyyy dirty. I think I will buy them some clorox wipes and light bulbs for their sign out front. I made 12 u-turns trying to find this place.
1,"Lets talk about failure, baby. Hey, if your idea of salad is punishment via tasteless lettuce and mealy tomatoes splashed with the most generic, industrial vinaigrette, youve found just the right place to BDSM your tongue. Go for it! I ordered Capellini Checca, and I had it substituted with Spaghetti (I like more girth re: pasta).  What I got was the limpest pile of spaghetti that couldnt be revived with a lifetime supply of Viagra.  The DOA pasta was topped with a pathetic sprinkling of more mealy tomatoes (the menu says Fresh Roma Tomatoes- these had the texture and taste of a dying horses ass moreso than fresh produce).  The faint, acrid garlic tasted like it came out of a shaker bottle and not a bulb- and motherf*&k, respectable Checca should have more than 1/16 teaspoon of microscopically chopped basil.   This place makes Old Spaghetti Factory look like fine dining, and I would rather starve than be even close to that chain restaurant of culinary doom.  Hell, this place is the  disowned, cracked-out junkie brother of OSF. Its really *that* terrible. I gave them the single star only because the management was incredibly lovely, and did not charge for the unforgivable disaster masquerading as edible food worth paying for."
4,"I have been dying to go here since a coworkers spouse is one of the chefs. We finally went  last night  before the Symphony and it was a very good dining experience. The food came impossibly fast. The shrimp and Sausage Po Boy sliders were heavenly. The bread is this roll type of joy like break back east. Yum. You know the type of bread you cant find in AZ or west of the Rockies as Al Pacino would say-lol!They also served the bread basket with a veggie type of garnish if mixed with butter and put on the bread it had a very pleasing taste to it. Innovative menu- Lobster Potpie and Duck Quesadillas. HMMMMMM! Interesting. I had a side of Mac and cheese which is what I had heard about for so long and a Caprese Salad. My friend had divine Salmon. I am not a Salmon fan but i tasted it and it was yummers. My Ice tea was tasty and my friend had  a Basil Mojito that was mixed well. I dont like them usually because they are so strong mouthwashy tasting, but this had a nice blend to it. The restaurant decor is beautiful.We did not get desert but I want to go back and try those Seasalt sticks. All in all I loved going here. DT was packed last night due to Wrestle-Mania but we were in and out  in an hour at 5ish, so try that time to avoid crowds. Service was great despite other reviews. I know great service and I had it."
3,"So Im not a big Chinese food fan, but my husband is. Truth be told, it usually makes me sick. But if I were to go to Chinese food, Dragon Palace would be one of the places that I would go. The food is decent and theres a lot of it. I really felt I was getting my values worth. The waitstaff was attentive (always there asking if I wanted a refill) and the food came out quickly. It looks like every other Chinese food restaurant in the world (lots of red and gold, lanterns, paper Chinese Horoscope place mat -- save for the deep teal walls).  Im not sure I would make a long drive to Dragon Palace because chances are you have a comparable Chinese food restaurant nearby, but if you live in the 32nd St. and T-Bird vicinity, this is certainly a Chinese food place worth trying.  As for the food, we ordered the Peking dinner for 2 which came with won ton soup, a pu pu platter (consisting of won tons - yum -, eggroll, a small fried shrimp, a skewer of glazed beef and honey chicken), Peking fried rice (fried rice with shrimp, chicken, pork and beef), Mongolian beef and the house chicken. (as an aside and a disclaimer, I am preggers right now and I have developed a severe dislike for chicken which means I, of course, hated the chicken dishes). My husband thought it all was ok. I really liked the won ton soup and the Peking fried rice. After dinner, we got the requisite fortune cookie (""Express yourself now."" WHAT?) and a really yummy banana wrapped in a won ton and fried with a sugar glaze thing. All in all, it was a good time at a pretty good Chinese Food Restaurant."
5,Best chocolate croissants EVER!!!!
2,Ive fequented here often enough to know that all the majority of the games here are all those ticket games and little claw type games. I come to hang out with friends and play some games. I can in on tuesday night around 6pm and thought to have dinner there since I had a coupon for the place. I really didnt care about price at the time with the coupon.  After being seated our waitress got our drinks took our order and everything was fine. After we recieved the food we were left unattended for quite some time. When the waitress finally returned I had to ask for a refill and some ketchup as well. My drink was empty so I would assume that would be something that the waitress would ask but I caught her before she left. My boyfriend did not recieve a single refill the entire night and we were there from 6pm to 9pm. We had friends meet us there and we just chatted it up for some time. It wasnt for some time that we realised that the place was bare not just of customers but of staff as well. It was as if they closed the place down and just left us. After the waitress had taken our check and cashed us out that was the last we saw of her. The plates of our food were still in front us the entire time and we had kind of placed them all together so that she could come and just take them...kind of thought that the bunch of plates stacked together would give the hint we were done but I guess I shouldnt be so subtle next time.  The food was ok at best. Nothing bad nothing good in hind sight though if I had to pay full price for what I got if that waitress had left us like she did and I didnt frequent the games I wouldve walked out. Probably wouldnt notice.  All in all go for the games if anything else. The games are even ok that is IF they are running. Sometimes I come in and games are off or not working. This is just a place that is convienent for myself and friends to meet up.
3,"The meat shop has 100% grass fed beef, which means that they also finish their beef with grass (alfafa) which cant be said for every place that claims to have grass fed beef.  This is great if you are trying to eat food the way its supposed to be, none of that factory farming... However the same cant be said for the pork.  The pork (or at least the bacon) contains nitrates which keeps me from eating it.  The farm that provides the pork also feeds the pigs grain. This place would be perfect if they were able to get pigs and chickens that are pastured centered and not fed grain as part of their diets.  Until then Ill stick to their great prices on the grass fed beef and obtain my chickens and pork from somewhere else."
1,I work right across the street and a few of us went here for lunch one afternoon. I ordered a salad to go. As soon as I saw the guy grab shredded sandwich lettuce to make my salad I almost told him to stop but I didnt. I regreted it when I started to dig in and realized the lettuce was brown and yellow. Very disappointed. $6+ bucks for nasty lettuce tomatoes and green peppers. I ordered a salad thinking I was getting something like the picture on their website. I wont be returning here. Ill be passing on lunch next time the co-workers opt for this place.
3,"It is a total dive bar...If you need a drink go get one.  There are pool tables, shuffle board, video game or two, and a jukebox.  The bartenders know their stuff.  Enough said!"
5,"Brown bag chicken sammich, mac n cheese, fried okra, and the bourbon drink.  Nuff said."
4,Their Bruschetta selection was absolutely amazing.
5,"I love that this Safeway is right across the street from my work. I like to walk here for a bit of exercise to get lunch. The deli is awesome. They have a sandwich bar that has these really great gourmet ingredients they will make a sandwich for you. For 5.49 its not too bad and if you use your Safeway card you buy 7 get the 8th sandwich free. They also have premade salads and a hot bar as well. Very friendly, Alan who has made my sandwiches the last couple weeks is very friendly and does a good job. Bonus points the Starbucks is right next to it!"
2,"The place has a nice little vibe going on and they have some unique items but the reason the rating is so low is that there really arent a lot of options that dont involve faux meat.  Arent these people vegan?  Dont they hate the idea of poor little animals being our food (even though that is the only reason they are alive)?  Then why so much FAKE MEAT?!   I will never understand the meat envy vegans and vegetarians have.  I go to a place like this to get a dish that uses vegetables in more creative ways, not to get some overly processed soy products that arent nearly as healthy as fresh lean meats like chicken and fish.  FYI, I love meat but every once in a while I like to grab a vegetarian dish.   Another negative is nearly everything is fried.  Guess they bust the myth that people are vegan because it is healthier.  Frying things is the cheap way out of actually creating a healthy AND tasty meal.   Ill give them a 2.5 star because what we chose was quite tasty.  But with nearly every option involving faux meat and tofu it really is a disappointment.  If you want legitimate vegan fare try out some indian places or Ethiopian places.  They are very creative and using spices to flavor a vegetable dish. The fake cheeses and meats are for Vegans with meat envy, not for Omnivores that just want a good meal.  Keep your expectations in check and you should be okay."
5,"We went here for my wifes birthday, and its a rare 5-star review for me. They scored on food, presentation, service and atmosphere. We sat indoors - its a bit hot out still - and loved the decor, including the fun pillows on our large booth seat. Service was prompt, friendly, and attentive - but we never felt rushed. They make a killer mango mojito that perfectly balances the mango, lime and rum flavors. The kurobuta pork was perfectly prepared. And after having some disappointing lobster (in Maine of all places) the Maine lobster here was done just right - firm but not tough. They serve it ""lazy style"" and did a great job with both claw and tail meat coming out perfectly. A special birthday souffle topped the evening off. Expensive but absolutely worth it for a special occasion."
4,"Tasty Kabob is kind of a throw away name, but the service and food are excellent. The hummus is good, not the best I have ever had, but it is better than many places I have been to. The chicken kabob was excellent, I am not sure how they spice the chicken shwarma, but it is excellent. I had the gyro platter and that was also excellent.  What I really do not understand is why Pita Jungle is so packed and this place is empty. The food is more authentic and frankly tastes better in my opinion. No more Pita Jungle for me. When I am in the area, I will go to Tasty Kabob."
1,"I decided to try qwest as I was tired of Cox continually raising their rates. BAD CALL! Cox may cost a little more but is completely worth it. If I wasnt locked in to a BS contract I would switch back right now. Internet: I signed up for their ""Heavy Duty"" internet @ 20 Mbps. I regularly test less than 2Mbps on dslreports.com. The best I have ever seen is a little over 5. When I call to try and get it fixed they tell me there is no guarantee on speeds. That is why they advertise ""up to"" 20 Mbps... Phone: Extremely poor sound quality, very loud static and crackling, shocking as this is what they should be good at. I called to complain they explained we would have to pay to have technician look at it. This was the day after install!! Helpful hint, call back and tell them you want to cancel your account. The customer loyalty group is actually decent, they sent out a tech free of charge. He fixed it after a couple of hours, but acted completely put out that we wanted a clear line... The bundle: Ah my favorite part and what has finally pushed me over the edge to submit a review...  I went with a bundled package (phone, cable, internet). The plan I signed up for was $147 a month. The first bill was $147, the second bill in Im at $272.43. I cant make any sense out of the bill so Im not sure why they think i owe this much. I love the fact that I will get the pleasure of wasting another hour plus of my day tomorrow talking to these fools.  The day this contract is up Im going back to Cox and Ill be happy to pay more!!"
4,What can I say - I love this place!  I was introduced to it by a group of 20 something friends so I was a bit worried going there (Im no longer of that age group.)  Turns out I had nothing to fear!  Roosevelt is perfect for a glass of wine with the hubby or post dinner cocktails with a group of friends.  Still have a the munchies after dinner - there is a great food menu selection as well.
4,Love Sweet Tomatoes!  My favorite is their Won Ton Chicken Happiness salad!  Although it can be expensive it is a great alternative for fast food!
1,"I give this location no love.  We went to this one rather than the one uptown on a Saturday night with a voucher from another location from a bad sushi upchuck experience.  Going late at night with a mostly empty restaurant, we still ended up waiting 10 minutes to be sat, then SHOVED and I mean shoved in next to the only other table in the place - the hostess snickered at me when I kindly asked to move a single table down (really sick of bitchy hostesses in Scottsdale by the way - your job is not that hard so shut up and color for christs sake)  Our waitress took another 10 minutes just to greet us, sushi took forever, and if you can believe it the fun hadnt even begun yet.   When paying the bill, we present the voucher to the waitress, who says she cant take it.  The manager came over with a bitchy look, basically trying to call it bull shyt and continued to give us the 5th degree about it for the next few minutes - certainly NOT appreciated.  She takes it to the point where she calls the other location where we got it (taking ANOTHER 10 minutes) and finally gives us our bill back - only taking off our 2 rolls and 2 nigiri.  This created one pissed off yelper instantaneously. Dont bother with this location - you could find bomb shrapnel in your soup and they still wouldnt give a damn.   And for the sake of all that is holy - STOP WITH THE CRAZY IM-TOO-SEXY-FOR-MYSELF SCENE!  YOURE NOT THAT COOL!"
5,We went today after lunch. I got my usual of lime basil and real mint chip (which I love for the real mint leaves) and my hubby got chocolate guiness and four peaks hop knot. Best ice cream in Phoenix! The staff is always super nice. They give us ice bags to take our ice cream home :-)  Love this place
4,"I have never eaten a regular meal here. I usually go for the reverse happy hour from 10-12pm. Cheap drinks, good food and a good atmosphere. The servers here are good. I dont eat sushi myself, but everyone I go with loves the Crunchy Crab Rolls.  They have three different pizzas, pepperoni, BBQ chicken and cheese. I have had the pepperoni and BBQ chicken. Both were extremely good. I definitely recommend that someone looking for a good time, cheap drinks, and good food."
5,"I come here probably at least once a week. The prices are right, theres a good variety of ""ethnic"" food, the cashiers are quick and friendly, and theyre just helpful. I locked myself out of my car when having a space-cadet moment and they let me use their phone to call AAA to bail me out.  Fresh flowers + great selection of wine and cheese + all the essentials  They deal is that they cut out the middle man to get great prices for quality products and they dont have sales because they always sell their products at the best price possible. =) GO TJS!"
4,"Just spent two years in Austin eating BBQ from all over the state. This place is legit.....for Phoenix. WORLD CLASS sausage and excellent brisket!   Sides were average.  Nothing much exciting there. The bread was killing both me and the quality of the meat. The sauce is too sweet.  It would be great for St. Louis style ribs, but this is Texas...put some spice in there."
4,Great fried fish and crispy onion rings....yum!
4,"Awesome pizza, great cocktails, and salads. Friendly staff. A favorite!"
1,"Be VERY, VERY careful asking for a sandwich as a wrap. I ordered a ham and cheese make your own sandwich, ordered it as a wrap to go. I got home, theres lettuce and mayo and... what this? whats this I see in this sandwich? theres the cut-off fingertip of someones glove lodged between the lettuce? (At least I hope its the finger tip of a glove - Im not even going to think of the other thing it could have been.) Ewwww.... gross.... I didnt finish the sandwich. Memo to self: Dont ever get wraps from Einsteins, particularly not the one on Shea. Disgusting. If it ever happens again, Im calling a local news station to report it, then Ill call the state health department. Gross, gross, gross, gross, gross, gross... if you cant deliver sanitary wraps, THEN DONT PUT THEM ON THE MENU. Not a place to go if you like wraps."
3,"This place confounds me... They have an excellent beer and wine selection. As a matter of fact, their beer selection is one of the best Ive seen in AZ. Tons of micro-beers and many different and unique bottles of rare Euro- brau. For the selection, to stop by and pick something up and go, this place is great. As a restaurant/Wine Bar bar, I give this place a big...Meh. The service was terrible. Of the party of 6, everyone that ordered a glass of wine, only got one. They sat with their glasses empty for at least 30 minutes. Those of us drinking beer, just walked over to cooler and grabbed a beer. We also had an appetizer. We got the warm pretzels with gourmet mustard. It was frozen pretzels they microwaved with Honey mustard. They were still cool in the middle and a little stale.  Maybe it was just an off night or something, Ill probably give it another shot."
5,"Never thought Id review a supermarket, but since its tough times for alot of people out there, Id like to share my 2 cents.. First of all, you dont need a card.  The deals are for everyone and it makes it hassle-free during checkout.  Now, about the deals ~ I find that Albertsons has the lowest prices and best deals and you can find them amonst any product youre looking for.  Its WAY cheaper than Safeway for sure. This is what i found yesterday:  88 cents for 2 (yes two!) snicker bars or other comparable chocolate bars, $1 for a bag of lifesavor hard candies, and $14.99 for a 24 bottle case of coors light.  They also had 69 cent bags of frozen veggies that people were buying like crazy.  Also, this location has really good cuts of meat.  Im Korean and was so excited that they had short ribs cut perfectly for Kalbi jjim (korean braised shortribs), and for $3.99 a pound, it was quite a deal!"
5,"I just love Chipotle. Fresh, yummy, spicy (if you want it to be). And the restaurant was clean a HUGE plus! My personal fav is the chicken burrito, no rice, no beans w/ fajita veggies, pico, cheese, sour cream, and lettuce. Guacamole and hot sauce on the side. So delicious!!! The person who did our order was so nice! It was my friends first Chipotle experience! She was impressed by how big the burrito was. Im glad I only live a few blocks away... because I will be back."
4,"I didnt stay here, but patronized their restaurant. The servers were very polite and accommodating. They frequently refilled our drinks and aimed to serve by making sure the fireplaces were working. Its a nice place to hang at if you have a reason to be here."
5,"This wasnt the first time, but we went to Tutti Santi for a family Christmas Eve Dinner.  All I have to say is that everything was simply perfect.  Not only the food, but the service.  Which to me makes a restaurant with great food go from good to great.   I ate the lamb shank- Angello Dorato, which fell off the bone and was delicious. I cleaned the plate.  Dad had the veal marsala with fettuccine alfredo.  The veal was fantastic and the alfredo was just right. The sauce was not too thick-not to thin.  Dad cleaned the plate.  From him being in the food industry for 30+years and eating in many italian establishments both here and Chicago, believe me that says more than alot.    Mom had the special of the night, which was a cioppino with tons of seafood.  When most italian restaurants serve this dish at least one of the seafood items will be rubbery or fishy tasting (not in a good way) especially the mussels.  Not here. Everything was the way it should be. I felt this was the plate of the evening out of 3 great dishes.   Mom didnt clean the plate, she has a small stomach.  But I will be eating the leftovers in about two hours after I sleep off my meal. Everything from the bread, the calamari fritti, to the tiramisu was fabulous.  Im glad we couldnt get reservations anywhere else for this special meal.    Gratzi and Buon Natale. Oh yeah, I didnt get the raviolis this time, but if youve havent had them its a must try."
4,"Hey, art is very personal so I wont pretend to be objective about jordre studio.  What I can tell you is that anyone who has the cajones to open their own studio and, more importantly, the staying power to be an ongoing entity is deserving of praise.  I have a friend who owns several of Kyles pieces and they look spectacular. If, like me, you look for a personal connection with your art, youll be hard pressed to do better than JS.  Kyle is outgoing and personal and, if youre especially nice, hell share a Schwanns ice cream sandwich with you.  How about that for an artistic connection?!"
3,"I like to call this ""My Bashas"".    On the positive side, the selection of wine and beers is pretty extensive, the produce is fresh with quite a few organic choices.  The natural foods section has a number of pleasant surprises and theyve added some new bulk dispensers there as well.  Ive had mixed experiences getting help in the meat section but the checkout up front is always quick, much faster than some of the other grocery store chains out there."
4,"Went to the Rooste for a Christmas Eve dinner among a small group (9) friends. I had never been. Had heard the name many times over the years when I had previously lived in Tempe.  Been intimidated that by where it set that it was expensive and swanky. Thats all a lie! It sets up high and has a wonderful view. Its not located where you are just strolling down the street and decided to pop in that is true. You wind through these grounds to the back of the property pass beautiful fountains and buildings until you come to the lite up restaurant. You can self park but why bother go for the valet.  You pass a smelly ranch steer at the entry that is probably wondering why the hell its there as much as I was. Inside the door the smell escapes you immediately, thank goodness. You see some young sap making cotton candy and wonder what the heck have I arrived at. A few more steps and you see you are in a western theme establishment, by the overwhelming amount of raw wood beams and flooring.  First stop the bar. Its a limited full bar and for this it losses a star.  From the bar the view outside is great and you can look down and see the country music band playing (it was a band but I wouldnt book em) but hey they gave the place a little extra pulse. You see the staff in casual western gear also and you instantly know youre welcome in your jeans.  Moments later our table was ready and half of us choose to take the slide down to the dining floor and the others took the steps. Hey I went for the slide! It was short and fast and another reason to come casually dressed.  Our waitperson was a delightful and articulate young woman. We skipped the appetizers to leave room for dessert (next time Ill reverse that decision). The menu was very good. Several steak cuts, enchiladas, fried chicken, BBQ beef & pork ribs, Seafood, a burger, pork chops, most plates $15 - $20.  While waiting for the salad course a magician name Flash comes up and asks if wed like some magic that night (he works for tips). He went about his tricks and blew our minds! THIS GUY I WOULD HIGHER for an event. Never figured out how he did what he did but would love to see him doing it again and again. So if he comes by your table take him up on his offer of magic.  The food arrives, the salad is good and fresh the main courses come and all are cooked to perfection. My medium rare T-Bone was actually medium rare for once! My steak was tender and taste fabulous. The food didnt hold its heat well and they serve sweet potatoes or rice with the dishes rather than standard baked/mashed or fried Idahos (extra charge for a standard potato - why? - Minus another 1/2 star). But over all it was a good meal. We barely had room for the dessert so we split a 9 layer chocolate fudge cake and another dessert among us. And we still had four or so layers of cake left to go home! It was so rich and such a huge slice no 3 people could have eaten the entire thing following a meal if they tried... 4 of us dug into this slice.  All in all it its a great steakhouse. Prices lower than Lonestar and Steak portions (ounces) bigger for your money, plus a better all over food and appetizer menu by far. Oh yeah Im a fan and will be returning again and again when I want a steakhouse to fill my steak cravings and a bit of entertaining to accompany the meal.  I highly recommend Rustlers Rooste."
5,Nobody likes going to the auto body shop..period!  These guys took a negative situation and absolutely turned it around. They immediately made me feel at home from the moment I approached the front desk; all the way up to the ownership of the shop. It was a professional experience with a family friendly approach. The work they completed on the rear bumper of my car was excellent. I HIGHLY recommend Impact AB for your AB repair needs. Tom Butka was a pleasure to work with. Thanks Impact AB for everything!
4,"This is my favorite Tapas joint in town. Its a place I have to get the same thing everytime and maybe more to try a few new items... my must haves are: Island Gingered Yam & Pumpkin Bisque Soup (Seasonal)... so good and the fact that its seasonal makes it even more of a special treat. Camarones Al Ajillo (Garlic Shrimp)... this is my all time favoreite dish thus far @ Havana... I can eat it as my meal as long as they provide me as much of their tasty bread as I need to sop the dish dry of all the yummy garlic sauce it contains. Maduras Fritos... Fried plantains... need I say more? Mojito... best in town in terms of authenticity. Marquesas de Chocolate aka Chocolate Pate... I never cared for dessert here until I tasted this strangely named treat. It is so rich at first you think it will be too little but then you realize you need to share with everyone at your table. Other worthy options:  Arroz Con Pollo... It has baby peas in it and I really dont like peas... but I like them in this dish! I got to try this dish because a friend ordered it as his meal and didnt even make a dent in it... so I got all the leftovers and it was pretty tasty and economical! Fritoras de Frijoles Negros... Ive never had Black Bean Fritters before--they are quite tasty dipped in Guacamole! Calypso Chips...A thinner more chippy version of Fried Plantains. Sun Spots... Sweet Potato Fritters pretty tasty as well... for a fried root vegetable! Datiles Con Chorizo... A meatier appetizer... not the best Ive had but pretty darn good. Empanaditas... These are alright... though Im partial to Filipino style Empanadas... but since I have no place to buy them from, nor have I mastered making them, these are quite good for a band-aid craving. Tamal Cubano... pretty tasty, but my fave is the soupier Salvadorean take on the chicken tamale. Flan... havent had it, but flan consistency throughout varying cultures seems pretty consistent. Free Goodness: Their Bread! Its just the way I like it, hot, thin and crisp crust and soft in the middle! As you can see, outside of the Arroz Con Pollo, I have not tried many of their entrees... Im quite content to dine with others and share Havanas wonderful tapas... but one day I WILL try their Paella. A vegetarian friend said they make a veggie paella that was pretty tasty... and she loves their Mojitos just as much as I do so I think she may be right on this one. Cant wait to try it... with a side of Camarones al Ajillo and a Mojito!"
3,"Unlike a lot of the other reviewers, I actually had a decent experience here. We came in yesterday (Sunday) around 2. The place was pretty quiet, excluding the plethora of football fans who came here to watch their games. They have a ton of TVs to do so, including a HUGE screen that was playing the Cardinals game. No complaints about that. Some of the guys were rowdy but hey so am I when I watch football. It took us a while to be seated. Im not quite sure where the hostess was. As soon as we were seated we were helped by a very pretty and sweet girl. Our food took a while even though the place was pretty dead, but what we got was satisfying. We started with the nachos which were really good and then I got their jalapeno burger and my friend got their pork sandwich sliders. The fries were seasoned well and crispy. The service needs some work: nonexistent hostesses, disappearing servers, slow cooks, but this place could be a real gem."
5,"Grassroots is right around the corner and we drive by it every week on our usual Friday-Dinner-Out.  I always assumed it was more of a pub than a restaurant.  My wife and I arrived around 5:00pm and were seated immediately.  The waiter was super attentive and knew the menu and preparation of everything I asked about.   We started with an AMAZING appetizer special of burrata* with ciabatta tips, their house spicy tomato jam and arugula with champagne vinaigrette.  It was described as a sort of an experimental combination of preparations from other dishes.  The burrata was silky smooth and spreads onto the ciabatta like softened cream cheese.  The play of flavors in this dish was excellent, wed go back here just for this dish alone. My wife ordered the lobster bisque as her entree, which was smooth and creamy with a good lobster flavor.  I suspect we could have asked for bread on the side, but it didnt come with it by default. I ordered the short ribs with roasted asparagus and jalapeno cheddar grits.  The ribs were cooked just right, just a little pink and tender with a concentrated glaze of delicious sauce layered on top.  The sauce had a light smoky flavor with a fair amount of saltiness, and appeared to be a long simmered reduction with bold flavor. As others have mentioned, the jalapeno grits are very good, not spicy by any means but a little crunch from the jalapeno pieces, creamy and well prepared.  I strongly recommend the short ribs to anyone. We splurged with dessert of key lime pie and a banana split.  The split included three large scoops of (what appeared to be) homemade ice cream and topped with caramelized pecans.  The key lime was tart and delicious. The portion sizes were perfect and considering the careful preparation and unique flavors the price was appropriate.  Its a little more expensive that I would like to put Grassroots into our weekly rotation, but I look forward to visiting it again and sample more items off the menu when the budget allows. * I didnt know what burrata was: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrata"
4,"Five Guys is good eats.  Weve been eating at this location frequently (perhaps too frequently!) since it opened. Honestly, I dont think the food here is any fresher than In & Out Burger, but I like the selection of toppings (can you say, ""fresh jalapenos!"") and the great selection of sodas. The peanuts are a nice touch to get you warmed up for the Main Event while you wait. I personally think its a little over-the-top to decorate the place in nothing but rave reviews (WE GET IT ALREADY!!), but the cool music makes up for the lack of ambience. Since the Zagat announcement earlier this week, its been mobbed.  Try to avoid peak hours, unless you want to wait for a table. Five Guys is definitely pricier than In & Out, but I think the selection of ingredients justifies the premium. 3 tips: -Our family of 4 (2 adults, 2 kids under 10) can make do with one order of fries, though the orders have gotten smaller than when they first opened. -Ditto for the burgers.  Dont let the moniker ""Little Cheeseburger"" fool you.  I got the regular burger...once.  But the ""Little"" one is perfectly sufficient for me, especially after I load up on toppings. -Cant decide between the regular fries and the tasty Cajun fries?  Ask for a half-half order and ""POOF!"", youll get it! Enjoy! UPDATE: Gotta drop em to 4 stars.  The last several visits, the fries have been soggy.  Once they were even opaque in the center --- not cooked!  Ask for them EXTRA CRISPY!!"
3,"Not the best burger Ive ever had, but a fun place to try with the coworkers on a Friday afternoon. I had the quadruple bypass and a few helpings from the all-you-can-eat fry station. Better than BK/McDs, but nothing to write home about. The waitresses were hot and they happily wheeled me out to my car in a wheelchair! But its more of an attraction than anything else."
4,"I am just providing a review for the Mother and Infant Care Department only, since my wife has just had our second baby delivered here. We really enjoy our stay at this hospital. The facility is very clean and nice. Room are good size with shower box inside bathroom, so you can take shower during your stay and care for the mom. During the stay, Mom and the caregiver are entitle to have breakfast, lunch, and dinner for free. All you have to do is call and place your orders. The foods are quite quality and the portions are decent. I am really impressed with this. The nurses are all knowledgeable, caring, and nice. They are always there when you call them and need them. Since this is our second child, it works out perfectly that the nurses only come by when we call them or when they do their routine checks. So, the rest of the time you are left alone to rest. The hospital where my first child was born was different. They let lots of interns and students come to our rooms all the times for training, so we were constantly bothered.  However in my opinion, if it is your first child, you may find that having people around all the time could help you not to worry too much (since we all know nothing when the first child come). The reason I didnt give this hospital 5 star is just because our discharge was taking so long. We thought we would be out by 11 AM, but we didnt get out until 3 PM... They said that because it was on Sunday.  I think it make sense. Overall, I do recommend this hospital for any new mother."
5,"BEST PANCAKES!!! We want the recipe. Theyre newly remodeled and better than ever. Always great bagels but now they have added more menu items, more choices. Great food, great people!"
1,OMG! what is the rave about? this place is disgusting! its dirty and the food is not worth it! i came here with my family and we each order a little bit of everything that is suppose to be good and popular there. unfortunately everything is bad. i walked by the waiters and they were all cursing really loud in vietnamese to each other. the table is icky and it smell like my cooked up oil . ick! go to Pho ao sen instead at least its clean.
5,"I dont drink a lot of coffee, but Im a fan of tea. Especially strange tea that I probably cant pronounce right. Oh, and I like it when it smells like scotch. Yep, Im a fan of Lapsang Souchong. But Im not a fan of ""foofy"". And thats one thing that Tea infusion is not. Its not foofy. Its funky. Its fun. And everyone who works there is really friendly. Beyond the teas, the food is good, too. I dont know that Id eat there every night, but its a wider variety than Id expect at a tea place. This is a regular stop of mine. Makes Tempe Markeplace worth it!"
5,"Thats Amore is awesome! Im glad to see that a nice, clean and friendly local place is being supported and recognized. It deserves the five star ratings- the gelato tastes fresh and you really experience all of the flavor. Its a nice place to ride your bike to and get a refreshing treat when it gets hot."
4,"Always good beer and good food. Well let me say the food is not super fantastic but its better than a lot of brewery food out there. Spinach dip is good, nachos are always a staple, burgers could use a re-do. Salads are pretty good, pizza is mediocre. Wings are not half bad!! Sauce is pretty fiery! Nice!! Not a wussy sauce here! But I do love this place and the patio. Beers you cant go wrong with. Very flavorful good beers. All I ask is just a bit more quality in the food. Thats all thats wrong IMO or not really wrong but something they could improve on."
5,"This place was the answer to my German grocery shopping dreams! I thank the Yelp community for leading me to Old Heidelberg. I was picking up a number of items for an Oktoberfest party I was cooking for and hosting at my house, and was able to fulfill most of my exotic German needs at this one stop. I picked up pumpernickel rye bread, authentic concentrated Maggi Würze seasoning (not the soy sauce-tasting stuff you find in most American grocery stores) and Knorr zwiebel-kräuter salat krönung. They also had lots of Knorr sauce mixes that you just cant find over here (for instance,  sauerbraten gravy). I stuck around for a few minutes to talk to the two women who ran the place (Andrea and Chris). I volunteered that I had lived in Germany for years, including Berlin and Bavaria.  They were totally friendly and even suggested some other places nearby that I could check out for German grub or rarer German beer selections. I promised I would be back... especially since I spotted that they had frozen leberknödel (liver dumplings). I made these once from scratch years ago but that was a lot of work. Knowing that they carry such delicacies has snagged me hook, line and sinker, as I am now destined to return and once again indulge my German food fantasies."
3,This place is pretty good. better than average but not great. Fish fry on Fridays is ok if you like DEEP battered fish. nice atmosphere lots of TVs. Uquiel Beer on Tap
1,"We checked out RnR on Sunday (just a few days after opening.) In all fairness, I have to agree with many of the other reviews. Even though they are new, these things are fixable so hopefully the feedback will be taken in the appropriate vein. The building is very cool and the vibe was energetic on a sunny Sunday morning. There was an abundance of waiters but they seemed to be confused and frenetic without a real focus on the customer. The menu is very limited and our server had not eaten most of the items. He was struggling to explain. Our drinks took more than 15 minutes to arrive even though we saw them sitting at the bar for the entire time. Our water had just disappeared. Then the food. I ordered the grill cheese ( a rare treat and when I order it I want it good!). It was cold and overwhelmed by heavy bread. The cheese wasnt melted. I sent it back and they simply nuked it and brought it out. Icky. Our son wanted a kids cheeseburger and the staff kept coming back and forth not sure if there was a single burger or sliders for kids. It became comical after the third person came out. My husband ordered a salmon omelet with several additional fixings. The eggs tasted like box eggs and it was lackluster and flavorless. We even took the time to provide feedback to management but we got a weak smile and ""come back and try us again."" He made no effort to ""make things right"" either by comping something else to taste or providing an incentive to come back. There are too many restaurants in town to have to go to one that is less than mediocre. The young crowd may enjoy it for the bar vibe it gives but the majority of the tables on Sunday am were families or middle aged and we saw similar responses at other tables."
5,"Oh Chipotle, I love you.  Healthy options even when craving Mexican!  My favorite is the chicken burrito bowl with fajita veggies.  Served on a bed of rice with black beans and pico de gallo, with some spicy corn thrown in....ahh my mouth is watering already.  Ive been to many locations, and all are clean, food quality is excellent, service is friendly and professional, and I always leave satisfied.  5 stars to you, my friend."
5,Good micro brew made right there. Food is good as well.
4,"My date and I started in the basement which was super cozy. While waiting, we were distracted by the amazing aroma of food surrounding us from other tables. Once we sat down, we could NOT make a decision about what to order--everything looked so good. Our server was very helpful in aiding us with picking appropriate sized plates (we were starving and nervous we wouldnt have enough haha). We left with a to go box and no room for dessert! Loved it. Cant wait to go back. GREAT date night spot. But we prepared to wait and have a drink, this place is busy for good reason."
4,"The coffee is excellent. The vegan peanut butter cookies are to die for and I generally loath all things vegan. I just tend to believe some things are meant to have milk and eggs in them...oh, and DO NOT get between me and a good steak, you may lose a hand! Anyways, luv all the independent art & designers. Right now I am coveting those adorable litttle robot sculptures. Oh no, I sense another collection/obsession coming on.....do robots get along with owls?"
5,"Why oh why cant there be one of these closer to my house?! I would take them any day over Subway. Their bread is fresh, their meat and cheese is sliced perfectly thin. This may sound strange too, but every Mr. Goodcents Ive been too has the BEST soda fountain Coke. Okay...I said it. Judge me.  I do prefer the Mr. Goodcents over in Tempe off of 48th Street, but this one is just as good."
4,"Nice ambiance, nice authentic spicy chinese food.   As good as you can get here in Arizona;  it aint L.A or San Fran, but does a good job to satisfy the craving for real chinese.   Of all the Cofco asian restaurants, this is one of the more presentable ones to bring business clients or a new date, if ambiance is key to scoring positive brownie points.       For some bizarre reason, on the weekends, it is filled with asian-women/white guy couples,    which strikes me as hilarious.  If it wasnt for this,  I would eat there multiple times a week.  Asian woman orders from real chinese menu;  her white guy orders from chow mein menu.   Side note:  Get a grip; asian women check each other out, and  usually not in a nice way--like in a sizing you up-comparing you to herself way--so I usually end up losing my appetite when I catch one of them staring at me (and my man) and whispering to her white guy or her girlfriends about me;  yah, I understand the shit you say about me, asian girls, because I speak your language too, hello!   So I compensate for my chinese food cravings by quick carry out.  Works like a charm every time.  Im happy, my own Cracker is happy.  Owner gets lots of business and is happy.    We all win."
5,"So my coworkers and I decide we want donuts on a Weds. I know typically donuts are on Fridays but what the hay. In my search for a really good donut I go to the Internet and Google ""best donuts"" and low and behold Bosa Donuts comes up. They have 3 locations, and the one in Chandler has 12 reviews, which all raved about how great Bosa Donuts were. So I notice they have a location at 35th Ave and Glendale! I had seen it many times but never stopped in thinking it was just the average run of the mill donut shop. Boy was I wrong!  Bosa Donuts is by far the best donut I have had in a very long time, maybe ever! I stopped by for a dozen this morning and bought a little something special for myself. I got to the car and took one bite and was in heaven. The what I would call a Cinnamon Fry with crumb topping was to die for. What I liked the most was it was not greasy like some other donut shops. (I wont mention any names, you know who you are!) Lightly crisp on the outside and so tender on the inside. The crumb topping was just the icing on the cake. It was all I could do not stop and get some milk so I could utterly devour the rest of my donut on the way to work. I did have a bite of an Apple Fitter after getting to work and it was very yummy too. They have many varieties and some wonderfully looking croissants too. If you have not tried Bosa Donuts in Phoenix you are missing out!"
5,"I love Tempe Marketplace and frequent it regularly.  It has many dining, shopping, and entertainment options.  It is an outdoor mall and in the summer there are misters and in the winter heat lamps and a large fire pit.  It has stores that are usually only found in malls such as Tillys, American Eagle, and Victorias Secret, but also freestanding stores such as Target, Best Buy, and Ulta.  There are a large variety of restaurants and a Harkins Movie Theater as well.  It is a great place to hang out with friends and see the local night life!"
3,"Sorry, I really just dont get it. I didnt hate it and Im not hating on it now, but I dont see what all the fuss is about. * Pizzas slapped together resulting in uneven, soggy crusts. Our party ordered 5 of the 6 available. * Psychological warfare of having to wait forever for just a few tables maintains an air of pompous superiority that tricks the famished patrons into reporting the pizza is a lot better than it really is. Waiter actually boasted about the 3 to 4 hour Saturday night wait, which we got around by having reservations! * Bottles of iced tea and other drinks bought in bulk rather than any alternative that would make more sense. Good? Not bad... Best in the Phoenix Valley? HIGHLY debatable, but personally I really cant say that I think so... Best is the USA? Impossible, theres just no way. LGO is better. Cibo is better. Spinatos is better. Most hyped? Most definitely."
3,"Bizarre location with good food. Dont expect an ""environment"". Its poorly decorated but looks as if there is a rockin karaoke setup there. Still, I liked it."
4,"You dont come for the run-of-the-mill pizza. Nor do you show up for the cheap pitchers of beer. No, you make it here for the show. A massive organ fills the entire building, incorporating dozens of intruments, and the virtuosos playing it take center stage. Sit back and watch then perform your favorite songs, from Star Wars to The Little Mermaid. Dont let the average food dissuade you from a one-of-a-kind experience."
5,"My son comes here for the tacos but I am all about the chile relleno.  I never had one with potatoes inside, but oh my, this was the best!  My only recommendation would be to order it dry, with the sauce on the side.  I am counting the days until I get back to AZ.  The new location is so much closer to us, I plan on trying all of their menu, but....but... that chile relleno is ....calling....me.......! The tacos were very very good though."
5,"The people at this title company are as good as it gets. They are eager to do a really good job for the agents that use them.  Bill Risser and Paul Guenther are techno pros regarding the Social Media techniques and readily share their expertise and time to teach the skills of Twitter, Facebook, Hootsuite, and  other aspects of Social Media which agents can utilize to serve their clients in a diligent and efficacious manner.  The buyers and sellers of  property will really gain by using them because their handling of the transaction will be efficiently and quickly finished."
4,"They had amazingly quick service during lunch! The servers were VERY polite, almost to the point of being obnoxious. I ordered the daily special--bacon cheeseburger--which came out hot, fresh, and delicious, though the fries were heavily over-salted. Our drinks were also quickly refilled without us asking, which was nice but unfortunately their tea basically tasted like water. Overall, it was a good experience and I would come back again."
4,"Good pizza, nice place & the owner was very accommodating. Im a fan."
5,"Old school style butcher shop that has great service and a great selection.  You will pay more, but you can sign up for their emails and get the monthly and weekend specials.  Often there are coupons for BOGO or a few bucks off your purchase.  They also have a good selection of beer and wine, side dishes, and some supplies for home BBQ and smoking.  After reading the other reviews, I know my hubby and I need to try the jerky.  We always enjoy shopping at Von Hansons."
5,Best donuts I have ever had.
4,"Sorry for my lateness but I wanted to update everyone that after my review I was contacted by management, apologized to, and asked back for another chance. I WILL be back just as soon as it cools down and update my review then. Everyone deserves a second chance to make things right. I appreciate the professionalism and attention to customer service. Im looking forward to it."
2,"Okay...this was very surprising since it was just voted Best Southwestern food in PHX mags Best of the Valley issue...and thus, it made us want to have a visit. I LOVE southwestern food...and I was very let down by this place.  I feel like I should give it 3 stars...but as an ""A-OK"" rating, I just cant.  If 3 stars were for ""OK food"" then Id give it 3 stars.  But truly, I have...I have had better. PHX Mag said to try the crab cakes, which we did, and they were delicious.  Very happy with them and therefore expected the entrees to be just as great...but they werent.  : (  I had the salmon, which the waitress recommended and it was such a bummer.  It had way too many conflicting tastes going on that didnt seem to blend at all.  I lost my appetite after a few bites.  My boyfriend had the shrimp tacos which were just...average.  We were really disappointed.   Again, the crab cake appetizer was great and the two margaritas were as well - the Tontorita and the Prickly Pear - both very, very yummy.   But overall, if PHX Mag continues to recommend more lame-oid meals, Im gonna have to start using it as wrapping paper instead of a go-to guide for great meals in this town."
2,"I was here once. A reasonably sized girl broke her white plastic lawn chair and tumbled to the ground. I averted my gaze and tried to focus on my overpriced mediocre eggs benedict. My friend just laughed and laughed. I guess I should have ordered the mimosas, too."
1,"Should be called The Bad Egg. Bottom line, the hotels free breakfast tasted better than this and we got better service there.  We arrived around 945am on a Sunday morning and had to wait around seven minutes to be seated. The staff was pleasant enough. We were seated, given menus with water and she took our order for coffee and the breakfast special (loaded potato skillet). We sat for 15 minutes before we saw our waitress again. She finally figured out she forgot to bring our coffee. We finally got some coffee which was mediocre in flavor. Our food arrived about ten minutes after that. The skillet was supposed to contain sausage, bacon, onion, scrambled eggs, grilled american potatoes covered with cheese and sour cream. Mine had no bacon, two tiny chunks of sausage, no cheese, and the potatoes were so soggy, they tasted like someone had thawed them and thrown them in as an afterthought. It was so unpalatable i could not eat more than one bite, even after loading it up with salt and hot sauce. The waitress never checked on us once during the meal. She came back by the time my husband was finished. I told her the meal was horrible (in a nice way). She offered me something else. By that point, I was not feeling like eating anything else, I felt kinda sick. My meal was comped and we did get an apology. The manager explained that everyone LOVES that special and the potatoes are seasoned and grilled. The cook obviously didnt try my potatoes. Blech. Even with the comp, the total was over $15 for one special and two coffees. Very hight priced for nasty food, poor service, and loud/uninspiring atmosphere."
5,"One, two Feddys coming for you! ""Three, four better lock your door!"" ""Five, six pick up a crucifix!"" ""Seven, eight better stay up late!"" ""Nine, ten if Freddy Kruger went to Lush hed have had great skin!"" Dude, this place is AMAZING! All of their products are all natural, freshly made without preservatives, and are just incredible.  My best friend and  went here after a four martini lunch plus shopping, and we had a had treatment done with their Ocean Salt Cleaner and exfoliator.  It is made with sea salt and smells just like a margarita!  his was followed by using their dream cream, and now I am hooked!  And its not just the martinis!  I have very sensitive skin, and I have never had a reaction.  They also have a great mens line as well.  I have been using the Ambrosia Shaving Cream for men as well on my face, and I have no razor burn.  It is like a light cream that moisturizes while I shave.  Wow!  I have never felt good after a shave! Anyway, I could gush all day about this place, but the bottom line is it has incredible products that are all natural, and many are vegan,  the staff is amazingly helpful and not at all phony, and even though it may seem expensive the products last for a long time, so the cost is really not that high.  Get thee to Lush!"
4,"Great food, great price, very awesome lunch specials.  I would have given 5 stars but the service is normally a bit fast and some of the wait staff are a bit pushy!!  All in all, great value."
4,"I recently stayed at the Valley Ho for a conference being held on-site. My experience was really nice, everything from the food to the retro style room to the poolside atmosphere.  Cafe ZuZu has an assorted lunch selection and Trader Vic was only a short on-site walk where I enjoyed their happy hour. The front desk, catering and valet staff were helpful and provided outstanding service to all the guests.  When scheduling future company events I will definitely keep the Valley Ho in mind."
4,Very nice place with extremely friendly staff.  The food was similar quality to other Mexican food places in the NW Valley....good but not spectacular.   Very good portions for the price.   I dont live close by but will certainly go back when I am in the area.
4,Dont know why it took me this long to check out Joes Farm Grill but my out-of-towners got a kick of this place. We ordered : Fontina Burger - 4* BBQ Chicken Pizza - 4* Grilled Veggie Pizza - 3* Sweet Potato Fries - 2* Garlic Fries - 4* Onion Rings - 5* Chocolate Milk Shake - 2* The good: - great selection of American food / good portion sizes - allow upgrades to different kinds of fries to your meal - the decor & cute history behind the farm - open kitchen / sauce bar - friendly staff  - outdoor picnic benches under a huge tree where the kiddies can enjoy themselves - hand washing fountain conveniently located by the soda fountain - kiddies love the cool restrooms  The bad:   - lots of flies outside (thats summer in a farm for you) - limited seating inside - real vanilla milkshake tasted weird ( too much lemon juice?)
5,"This place is everything a sports bar should be. Lots and lots of TVs...for one. I love being able to watch 4 different sports and play trivia all at the same time. The drink specials are pretty decent. Theyre not a dollar or anything, but the big beers are cheap on happy hour. The food is great! So far Ive only tried the spinach dip, wings and their all-you-can-eat fish & chips. All of them were seriously delicious! These types of food are pretty standard in sports bars but Ive definitely had my fair share of unfortunate food items from other places. These certainly surpassed my expectations. And last but not least, their star of the show, Debbie. One of the best bartenders Ive ever seen. She runs that bar like a champ, knows nearly every face that walks through that door, and pours great drinks. And by great, I mean a good stiff drink thats not so strong that you cant taste anything else in it. We frequent this place quite often, and for good reason. Do yourself a favor and stop in!"
4,this place will kind of throw you off when you first step with the wall nic nacs and the display that sells body wash and toothpaste next to chop sticks and such but the food is surprisingly delicious.. my husband order the chicken curry friee rice with orange chicken and he loved it. i had the chicken and beef chop suey and was not disappointed. kudos to this joint could do with some spring cleaning and a little sprucing up but good all the same
3,"I really try to like Old Town Scottsdale - and if you look past all the God-Awful tourist traps it is actually quite a nice place with a number of top notch dining options - but in the end you can only walk by so many mass-produced ""native"" jewelry shops with ""Bargains"" before it all starts blending together.  Parking is generally a travesty but can be found if youre willing to wait it out and the public art is a nice touch.  For my dollar - go, grab a spot, and kill some time at Cartel, grab some local foods at Bodega, and maybe consider a bite at one of the locally owned restaurants like FnB or Praying Monk, and skip any place with turquoise jewelry in the window while focusing on the galleries that dont quite seem to fit the theme."
1,"I bought a deal off of Living Social and waited a while to call them, figuring theyd be swamped with business. Now I cant get them to call me back so I can use my deal. (NOTE: There were no reviews of this company on Yelp BEFORE the Living Social deal.) Of course, Living Social is no help - their website says I need to call a consumer advocate in my area. This kind of thing, I predict, will be the demise of every deal-of-the-day site: the company selling the deal bears no risk of having to pay refunds if the business providing the goods or services doesnt perform. I have since cancelled my subscriptions to EVERY deal-of-the-day email out there. Lesson learned about TWO companies with no ethics."
5,"Absolutely LOVE spicy pickle! Sandwiches are great (always make sure to get them HOT!) Pickles are awesome too!  Food is consistent and really good. Good variety, and you can easily make your own sandwich with a ton of choices. Good breads, meats, cheeses, toppings, sauces. Overall a really good sandwich!"
4,"So the other day, I was in the mood for sushi at my usual spot (Sakana).   Unfortunately, they were closed for lunch, so the next choice was some pasta at Caffe Boa next door.  Also closed for lunch.  Double Shit!!   Pasta Pomodoro?  Their tortellini alfredo rocks!!  Then I find out all of their AZ locations closed.  Triple shit!!   Stomach is growling and quickly getting pissed off.  Okay, Haji Baba then.   Bessie gets me there in record time but alas, the place was PACKED, even for a 2pm lunch.  What to do?   Wait...theres that little Vietnamese joint a few doors down, that Ive always wanted to check out but just never did. Well, I guess they say better late than never for a reason.  I popped in, grabbed a seat and was quickly served up one of my favorite Vietnamese dishes.  Deelish is all I can say.  Now Ive got a new little spot to add to my local list of favorites."
3,"Tried this for dinner one night.  Had the hot and sour soup, which was good.  Partner had the won ton soup, but had to ask for crispy won tons to add to the soup.  I had a diet coke to drink, but I swear there was alcohol in the glass - I sent it back and the same happened again.  i tasted my partners and hers was fine - not sure what was going on there. I had kung pao beef - it was a little too crispy.  My partner had the shrimp version (she wanted scallops but they were out !) - she said it was excellent. Liked the decor, but a bit pricey for what you got."
5,"If your day is lacking a good decision, this place will change the course of your life - at least for an hour. I have only ever ordered the Oggie (Im a one pasty kind of guy), but most of my friends have had their way with the rest of the menu and it doesnt disappoint. Easily one of my favorite spots in Tempe.  Its also a much larger version of its former self so you no longer have to gladly wait an hour for a table."
2,"What is the big deal about this place?! Its not great, but pretty good. Not bad, but ok. Just is what it is. We had some wings and a stuffed pizza, and the wings were undersized yet pretty flavorful. The pizza, I just dont understand the hype. Maybe Ive had Giordanos, Ginos, and Lou Malnatis too much in Chicago but this place just wasnt it. The pizza is okay, and just okay... if nothing else, WAY too salty. After a while, I felt like I was consuming a salt lick. Service was weird, and Im pretty sure our server was on coke. the restaurant was PACKED and the place was buzzing and he came and sat at our table and started shooting the shit. It was very bizzare. We got someone elses order of wings, and didnt know they werent ours until the server told us (after we had eaten them all) so we felt kind of bad.  Id go back here again but I wouldnt really be too eager to."
4,"A perfect way to top of an exotic shopping experience at 99 Ranch.  The Taiwan Express has photos of many (not all) of their dishes. Very authentic.   Also try some shaved ice for desert (brought me back to Singapore!).  My kids love the shaved ice, though they are more used to Asian foods than most kids.   Note that the Buffet section (to the left) is better than any mall food courts, and may be more tame for some taste buds.   AND - in between the buffet and Taiwan Express you can buy a whole roast duck for about $12.50, which they will cut up for you.  Be sure to buy some Plum Sauce (elsewhere in the store) for a sweet dipping sauce for the duck (yummy!)."
4,"Yes, Im a fan this place but it definitely does not deserve a 5 star rating.  First off lets start with the decor.  While it was very nice when it first opened its now getting a little raggedy looking and could use some updating.  Food wise this buffet is above average and definitely worth a visit.   If I could give them some advice it would be to get rid of  the HUGE salad buffet section or at least scale it way down and put that money into even more entree selections.  Ive been coming here ever since they opened and hardly ever see anyone eating off the salad section.  So why spend so much money to have such a huge selection???   Put that money into the entree selection and make this place an even better value.  And for Gods sake bring back the Mayonnaise Shrimp !!  You made one of the best versions Ive ever tasted."
3,"Zipps has good bar food, but the service is usually horrible. The waitresses rarely come to your table. BUT, what really rubs me the wrong way is this.... On multiple occasions, when I pay the bill, the waiter doesnt bring me back the correct change. Even if my change is 1 cent, Im entitled to receive my money back.  Im sorry, but not giving me back my  change because you deem it insignificant doesnt float well with me. They do have great food though."
3,"if you want a really filling, delicious ""please-make-my-head-stop-feeling-like-its-about-to-explode"" hangover cure, there guys have got the remedy!  the hangover helper is all of the above and gets even better when you add the hair of the dog bloody mary for an extra $3! (they also have live music on sundays during brunch!) the architecture and windows are stunning in this place - if youve never been in here, its worth checking it out!"
5,"So far, I have been to Lola twice (a Saturday night and Monday morning). Saturday night was very quiet compared to the super busy Monday morning. Free Wi-Fi, coffee, baked goods, and awesome location...you cant beat it. The morning we went, we had a Monterrey Jack scone that was really good. I laughed when I got my latte in a ""So I Married an Axe Murder""-esque cup. We sat along the high tables facing Central Ave and I really enjoyed surfing the internet and looking out towards Central. There are various types of seating as well as some outdoor tables. I really loved this place but worry that it will be one of those places that will be so popular, youll never get to sit there. That is why I stopped going to Lux because it eventually got so crowded all of the time. My favorite part of Lola coffee is being right on Central and watching traffic and the light rail go past. Love it, love it."
4,"Ive been to Padres several times with local friends and have always enjoyed the food and atmosphere.  This time my table mates included my brother and sister-in-law who were visiting from the east coast.  And who do they always count on for recommending awesome places to eat while in town?  Yup...me.  The pressure was on.  From the opening appetizers of guacamole, salsa, chips, and margaritas to our main dishes, the food was great.  The staff was extremely friendly, including our waiter Chico who kept us laughing.  I am normally a Salmon Spinach Enchiladas guy but decided to go out of my comfort zone with the West Coast Burrito.  Strange combination but it really works well together.  And what did my out-of-town guests think about Padres?  Loved it."
4,"I absolutely love the atmosphere and vibe of Switch.  Ive been there 3 times, once for a latenight snack (before they were serving alcohol) and twice for breakfast.  My favorite thing about it is that I feel completely comfortable going by myself with a book and lingering over breakfast and coffee. Service is always very quick and super friendly, and prices are good.  Unfortunately, as much as I love GOING to switch, I have to be honest and say I havent been wowed by the food so far, although I still need to try lunch/dinner.  Foods not bad, not at all, just nothing spectacular. Having said that though, Ill still go back often!"
3,"Pei Wei is always busy, thats gotta mean something right? Wrong. There are restaurants that serve billions yet all they serve is a gross mystery. Pei Wei is no mystery though, the food is cooked in an open air kitchen. Even so, if there were such a thing as Asian fast food, Pei Wei would be cleaner version of it. Most Pei Weis are situated in pompous locations where ever there is an AJ Fine Foods, but atleast they arent located in the ghetto. As far as the food goes, it is about as Americanized as you can get. So if you live in America and have American taste buds, it will appeal to you. Unfortunately if you want authentic Asian food you wont find it at Pei Wei. I dont understand why they even bother to put chopsticks on the table, the rice isnt even sticky enough to pick it up with. They are for decoration. They are part of the fake Asian dining experience. Apparently, Pei Wei serves food ""manadrian style"" from Thailand, Vietnam, Japan, Korea, and China. In the words of Bill Lumbergh, ""Ooo.. yeahh.. Im just not sure about that."" Having traveled to China I can honestly tell you that Chinese food is different. Apart from the rice, the food lacks vegetable oil and garlic. In China those two ingrediants are used in many dishes and Pei Wei lacks them. When I first started visiting Pei Wei I ordered the Sweet and Sour, but I got sick of it. Sometimes the meat would be tough, sometimes the chicken would clump together all nastily. What I get now-a-days and what I got on this particular day was Mandarin Kung Pao. Even though the dish is spicy, that doesnt mean it has to be dry - and it was. What it was missing was some catalyst to bring out the spicy flavors and make them more vibrant. The dishes at Pei Wei are family style meaning they are meant to be shared with several people. A dish and a drink will end up costing you about $10. If each person gets one dish, thats a lot of food, probably enough to feed a small village in Africa somewhere. It would be nice if they served each dish in two styles, family and single, large and small. Family style is great if you always visit Pei Wei with your family. But if you are out for lunch with people from work you might not want to share your food with your co-workers. They arent your family. You dont know them. Pei Wei is a modern Asian diner that is probably better than most of the mom and pop Asian diners out there, even if most of the food is cooked by Mexi-- I mean Asians."
3,Kimchi - 5 stars. Other side dishes - OK. there is no date on it so I really dont know how fresh they are. I went there couple times to get side dishes other than Kimchi. it was not as good as Paldo. I only go to Seoul Market for Kimchi now.
3,"A  bit surprised at the high prices but figured that the ""trendy factor in old town"" and the atmosphere was the reason because the teeny portions of the food and the quality is just GOOD, like the Good egg, not great, not bad, just good.  No happy hour? And Too dark inside.  Lots of pretty wait staff.  My first suggestion would be to fire grill the mahi tacos and not batter them, they were not that flavorful. The side dishes of street corn and some potato chorizo thing were very good. I wanted to try the guac, but 12 bucks for an avacado with some garlic and cilantro? How about trying to make a good ceviche? My hubby and i thought that Rubios rocks in comparison, we love the shrimp tacos and the pablano and portobello tacos."
4,I really enjoy this place and have eaten there several times. They just recently changed their menu but I like the brew additions. The coconut shrimp are awesome and the ahi tuna salad is to for for!  I did have the chimichurri flank steak sliders but they werent good. Our waitress was great and offered me something else.
4,Decent place for pizza.  The only place in the West Valley to get decent Margherita pizza.  Not the best but good enough to satisfy.
5,Ohhh this is the best place ever! Every thing I have ordered has been delish!
5,"great service, great food, and great outdoor seating made for a wonderful first time experience at this charming little restaurant. you would think that sitting outside eating in the middle of august summertime in phoenix would be practically unbearable. local breeze made it tolerable and i dont think my overly-sweaty ass ever felt uncomfortable once during the whole dining experience. they had fans, a swamp cooler, and misters going and it made for a comfortable and charming outdoor dining venture. we started off with the greek lavosh which was to die for. the cheese they melted on top of it will make any cheese lover weak in the knees. their mojiot lemonade was crisp and refreshing. ok selection of beers, certainly not the greatest but i picked out a favorite, kiltlifter, to go with my coca-cola ham sandwich. my girlfirned (Rachel O.) went with the atomic burger as we are both fans of spicy food and this burger comes topped with horseradish. it even made her face scrunch up and me quiver in my seat the moment it hit my tongue and you better believe i enjoyed every second of it. the coca cola ham was HUGE and both of us only managed to eat half of it. leftovers are always good. service was spot on, and i enjoyed the decor and atmosphere despite what many people have complained about before. get over it, its no longer pallete, move on, and enjoy the local breeze."
3,"Bar Smith has potential to be a chic hot spot in the heart of downtown; just a few steps away from the symphony hall, Chase Field, and the US airways Arena. However, this place, despite its pseudo-hipness fails to deliver in the cocktail department, which, with its continuously crappy music, would be the only real reason youd come to this bar. Its really a 2.5 star place-- bartenders are nice,but dont really get the job done. When youre paying over $8/drink, youd at least expect them to do that. The roof is cool though so an extra .5 stars for that."
4,"Alright, well seeing as I work right next door, my mouth has been watering over this place ever since I laid eyes upon the menu. And tonight, we finally had some yummy Rumbi take-out. First things first: theyre a little pricey, at first glance. However, their portions are *enormous*. Each of us ordered a full size bowl(Honey Orange Shrimp for me, Jamaican Jerk Kalua Pork for Jamie, Honey Orange Kalua Pork and Teriyaki Chicken for Jamies parents). The full size bowls were more than enough to last the average person through dinner, and then through lunch the next day; packed full of rice/noodles, meat, and veggies, with each bowl containing a ramekin of sweet teriyaki sauce. The shrimp in my bowl was perfectly tender and succulent, the Honey Orange sauce sweet, but not cloyingly so. The bowl came with a lime wedge, which added the perfect zing to the mellow coconut ""Rumbi rice"". We also ordered some of their Bahama Mamas Tortilla Soup, which was a creamy coconut-based broth filled with chunks of grilled chicken, tortilla strips, and melty mozzarella. It was a good, cozy soup, but could have benefited from more depth--some tang, some spice, something. For dessert, we had some of Rumbis Key lime pie--moist, rich, and delectably sweet with a lovely measure of sour. Only complaint? The graham cracker crust was too mushy, soft, and crumbly; it would have been much better with a crispy bed under the pillowy-ness of the Key lime filling. All in all? Great place with reasonable prices, given their generous portions. They have a TON of salad options, as well, each more inventive than the last, and Ill be returning to try and test each one :)"
5,"Very good place for breakfast & lunch tucked away in the crowded shops at 44th & Camelback.  I kinda found this place on accident.  I meant to just run into AJs and grab a salad to go, but was forced to park basically across the driveway from Taylors, and, being closer, I opted to go there instead.   Taylors is open 6-4ish (I couldnt really tell, they probably just changed the hours and scratched off the hour number on the door), and they serve breakfast all day- well, all day theyre actually open- which is always good with me.   I was in the mood for corned beef, and , bingo, there it was.  Nice mound of lean tasty beef with melty cheese (no saurkraut or thousand island, please.).  And the bread- oh the bread- grilled to be crispy on the edges but still soft inside.  How in the hell do they do it?  I dont know, but Im in love."
4,"All around great.  Great food, great atmosphere and great location if you work in the downtown area."
5,This is a small location but still packed with everything I need.  They did start stalking more womens vitamins I liked without iron because they were always out when I went in.  So I thank them for that! Staff are always nice and for the most part an answer all of my questions.  They take an added effort to get to know their customers.  They always ask about my son when I go in and this keeps me coming back because I feel valued as a person not just a customer.
4,"Pretty yummy! I just went here for lunch and thought the pricing was the best feature. $6.95 for all entrees, which includes a bowl of spicy chicken soup (not sure of name). I ordered the Panang with pork and loved it. It had great flavor and the serving size was appropriate for lunch. Dont let the restaurants outside appearance scare you - the inside is not too bad. The servers were very nice and efficient. Ill be back, guaranteed, because they serve quickly and it works for my lunch hour."
2,"The upstairs theater is nice enough. There are a few nice semi-upscale restaurants here. Its also got a really good swanky (and somewhat hidden) bar here.  So why only 2 stars? Well, because it smells like this is where all the diarrhea in the world goes to die... especially the parking structure. If you can escape the smell though, this is a nice spot for a date. The problem with that is when you go walk her to her car, you have to try and figure out how to have a good night kiss while your nose is telling your brain that you are swimming in a septic tank. The new Waterfront mall corridor stinks like this as well. Maybe thats where the term ""filthy rich"" comes from. What do these people eat?"
4,"Stopped into this good-sized place for lunch today, with Mike C.  Its a little worn, but comfortable, & I counted up 81 regular food items.  All that I tried from the soup, salad, sushi, hot dishes, & dessert selections were good, & I particularly enjoyed these items: *  The Hot & Sour Soup! *  The Kim Chi! *  A tasty salad topping with broccoli, mushrooms, & more! *  The Seafood Salad! *  The Egg Foo Young! A good solid 4-Star place here!  Lunch Buffet $6.99, $6.29 Sr."
4,"At the ripe old age of 3, its time for my previous review to take a siesta. Over the course of that three years, Tempe Cameras only gotten better. The selections improved (finally finding a happy medium between film and digital), the prices are even better than they were, and I dare say service on the retail sides kickass too. TCR is now my go-to photo supplier as a working pro. Theyve either got what I need or can quickly get it, they still know their stuff, and they support both local photographic education and the local photo industry. Theyre also the only dealer in the Valley that sells Think Thank Photo products, which are best damn professional camera bags ever. And if youre an amateur, theyve got plenty of friendly, knowledgeable staff for you too. Dont be afraid to ask for someone else; like almost anywhere, they employ people of varying personalities. There are sales staff I dont click with at TCR, but I wouldnt classify anyone as distinctly rude. (If you want that, youll have to try B&H or Adorama.) If you need lots of hand-holding, the ASU crush probably means youll either want to shop at off hours or go to Photomark--TCR tries, but the crowd to counter ratio just isnt favorable at peak times. Repairs are still something they do very well at excellent prices. When Ive had equipment serviced, its been turned around quickly, relatively inexpensively, and works like brand new. Evaluation of your equipment is still free, as it should ideally be at every repair shop (but often isnt). The labs added a bunch of cool new services, including damn fine plexi mounting, and is doing a considerably better job with film than their old reputation for free scratches with purchase would suggest. Hundreds of frames processed with nary a scratch to be found. Rentals Im a little more ambivalent about.  Theyve thinned the herd out considerably (about half the rentals inventory has taken up residence in the used equipment case) and the selection of lighting equipment is basically unchanged, but theyve got the latest Canon and Nikon bodies, and everythings well-maintained and in good shape. Rates are good for what they do have--the questions just if they have what you want."
2,"Theatre is very nice. Seats are not as comfortable as you would think. They have like office chairs in every other row. Also the food is not good, and its so overpriced. Did you know it costs a dollar to put onions on your burger? Want cheese? Thats another dollar. And its not even good. Screen is beautiful and a clean picture though.. 3D was great."
3,"If you want a dog and are in the area, this is a pretty good call. Having said that, it is probably not worth a special trip. You can find a better hot dog or brat at a ballpark or in the supermarket."
5,"Coffee talk is a nice surprise nestled in the hum drum downtown of Mesa. I have been enjoying their coffee and live talent since I was fifteen. When I was in High School it was a ritual to hit the local dollar movie and then end the night with some coffee at coffee talk. I think the best part was hitting on boys and trying to pass as being at least eighteen years old. My reasons for going to Coffee Talk have changed over the past decade, but the atmosphere and quality drinks and pastries have not changed. There is nothing better than sitting on their back patio and enjoying the cool breeze of the fall. There is something about that place that brings me a sense of relaxation. If you enjoy artistic ambiance, coffee, and live performances then I would recommend Coffee Talk."
4,"If youre a fan of Postino, you have to make your way to Windsor pronto. The central Phoenix restaurant and bar is owned by Postino owner Craig DeMarco (and its right across the street from the central Phoenix Postino), and the atmosphere and vibe are similar to Postinos. Windsor also has an open dining room that extends to the patio, the lighting is also dim, and the servers are also hip. There was a 30-minute wait for my party of two on a recent Friday night, and we sat in the indoor dining area, which overlooked the bar, which was bustling full of people and had standing room only. The restaurant is located in an historic brick building, and it has a cool wall covered completely in cassette tapes that makes it feel even hipper. For food, my pal and I started with the Cheddar Fondue ($11) off the mostly-American menu, which comes with pretzels, apples, pork, bread and sausage. The pretzels were soft and chewy, and the portion was huge. I would have preferred just the pretzels, though the apples and cheese were an interesting combination. Definitely try that appetizer if you go-it was super-tasty. For my meal, I got the Veggie Stack ($9), which was a pita topped with bean spread, quinoa, tomato, cucumber, avocado, radish,  corn and green goddess (I left the pickled beets off). I thought the toppings were interesting both taste- and texture-wise, and that part of the meal seemed relatively healthy. I paired it with some macaroni and cheese, which I enjoyed, though my pal and I werent wowed. Maybe its because the cheese wasnt plentiful or creamy enough, but it was still good. My pal had the Porkwich sandwich ($12). He said he liked it a lot."
4,I finally tired another dish. The Panag Curry with tofu. It was great too. Rich thick curry crisp veggies and tons of flavor. One thing I am upset with its the new $1 fee to use a credit card for bills that are less than $10. So get a drink or bring cash...
4,"Fresh & Easy is the US subsidiary of UK based grocer Tesco who entered the American market in 2007.  I know Tesco really well and they are smart business folks who know their market.  Fresh & Easy has been opening stores all over the Phoenix area and have been using $20 and $10 coupons to build market share.  I give them a lot of credit for doing this. I also have been shopping here for a long time and appreciate their eye on packaging food items for the busy consumer.  One of my favorites is their rosemary focaccia bread dough.  Ive made it at home, but Fresh & Easy make it ohhh so easy when Im tired and its 6:45. BTW, thanks for the Hybrid parking space!"
2,"No way am I coming back here! The shoes seem to be made poorly, but I havent actually kept a pair of shoes and I never will because Im never coming back. I bought one pair because I thought they were cute, but quickly changed my mind so I returned them. Do you know how many people asked my WHY Im returning them? In a very rude manner, literally all the people who were working there. Not only did it make me uncomfortable but they lost a customer because of it as well."
4,"Ive been here so many times, I cant believe I havent reviewed Black Bear yet! This is me and my friends ""go-to"" breakfast place. Ginormous portions, and for a decent price. A little slow on the service, but if youre not in a hurry its no big deal. Basically down home cooking. You see diner and that is exactly what you get. Good eats!"
5,"This place never ceases to amaze. One of the best breakfast places in Phoenix. The Sicilian scramble is a favorite--though the smashed meatball was great. We finally went back for dinner the other night and for the first time I had a burger. It should not be surprising that is was fantastic. Atmosphere is great, service is great, and the food is great--just go!"
3,"Shaved noodles, shaved noodles, shaved noodles!  Am I too butt lazy if I only go for shaved noodles?  The dish ordered with the handpulled meant I had to hold chopsticks high into the air trying to separate a portion of noodles out onto our plates.  Not bad but wasnt special... but the shaved noodles, loved the chewy texture.  I unashamedly used my baby godson as an excuse to get a mini noodle pulling show at the window. Im going to work my way thru the fresh fruit juice offerings...  I used to drink that daily while working as an expat in HK.  Speaking of which, the bathrooms are sooooo HK grand (Amy L, you and I think alike!)... Overall the stir fried dishes were a bit greasy and the flavors decent, but the draw here is the shaved noodles (can I plug this anymore?!) and the fresh fruit juice."
4,"Valle is all about the ritas happy hour, chips and bean dip and an awesome patio, if you are looking to eat awesome pollo funditos well they have that too..."
5,"Great facial great customer service One Love Boutique Spa consists of the waiting room/reception area and the services room.  Its small, cozy but super cute and inviting. I love the way its decorated which is what drew me to buy a Groupon for a signature facial after looking at the website. The decor is white, clean, girly and classic. I was disappointed at first when my initial appointment was cancelled two hours before I was scheduled due to Amanda coming down with something that was contagious, I guess I was thankful too. When I came in for my facial I explained that I was one of the appointments that was rescheduled due to her illness and she upgraded me to the anti aging facial for free!  She also includes eyebrow waxing with every facial which is awesome! The facial was AMAZING and Amanda is very knowledgeable about what she is doing and the products she is using.  Before my facial started I had asked her to mess up my hair as little as possible since I was going somewhere right after, she kindly obliged  and when I left my hair looked exactly how it looked when I came in. Amanda is great and I will definitely be back!"
5,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE Paws Salon. I used to take my dog to Canine Preferred but the ladies at the front dest were flakey, so I thought Id try a new place and I am SO glad I did. The owner Tracy clearly has a passion for animals. Walking in you are greeted by a cat, dog, and Macaw that call the front of the shop home. You are able to see them grooming the dogs (a big plus for me, you never know what some places do behind closed doors). She is very professional and seems like a no bullshit kind of lady (in a good way). Shes to the point, tries to listen to exactly what you want and offers options and suggestions to help. They keep track of the previous cut that was given (its annoying some places you to have to tell them every time). I would highly recommend this pet salon. They also offer daycare, and overnight boarding. I cant want to try the daycare to socialize my pup some more! Cant go wrong at this salon.."
5,"I just stopped in tonight after the gym, I was a bit stinky and what better way to fix that than 16 bars of soap. It was late 8:15 when I walked in :15 before close. This is a great time to shop when you are in a rush. It was empty, and the lines were short. Despite benign the end of a long day the low turnover staff was great and personally recognized me and greeted me."
5,"As far as fast Japanese food at lunch this is as good as it gets.  They have a different Bento Box lunch special everyday.  The box comes with plenty to eat, including Miso Soup which arrives shortly after ordering.  The meal includes sushi, salad, rice, chicken (teriyaki or such), gyoza, some type of fried fish and an orange.  For about $8-$10 its hard to find a better deal.  I would highly recommend CherryBlossom for those looking for a Japanese meal.  It is small, quiet and a little hard to see from the street, which makes it a unique place with low traffic, but high quality."
3,"I tried a few different kinds of pizza and they were all okay.  A few people had told me that they made ""incredible"" pizzas, but I didnt really think so...Id say they were pretty good pizzas.  What I liked were the fresh tasting vegetables which topped some of the pizzas.  The cheese was a bit disappointing, especially since I dont think you can really go wrong with cheese...it just lacked flavor. All in all, I probably wouldnt go back...it just really wasnt all that impressive."
4,"In n Out, I dont know how to tell you this, but . . . Ive found someone else.  No, no, its not like that, it was nothing you did!  Your burgers with their fresh toppings are delicious... but sometimes I just need a little change of pace, maybe something with grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, and bacon... mmm... bacon.  Oh, sorry.  You want to know the name?  I dont see why that...  You insist?  Okay... its Five Guys. Oh!  Youre upset!  YOURE upset!  Well let me tell you what - Five Guys fries are delicious, whether they come in Cajun OR regular!  And I NEVER liked your fries, In n Out!  I just pretended to like them, but theyre skinny, kind of limp, never flavorful, and you dont get very many.  Five Guys cuts em thick, salts them up, and pours an extra scoop into the bag, how do you like that!  And they give you FREE peanuts to munch on while you wait.  You never give me anything! What?  No... youre right, Five Guys is a more expensive taste.  Thats true, it is over $10 for a burger, fries, and drink, as opposed to your $5.  And I do have to park in a garage that loosely resembles a labyrinth designed by Escher.  But if you eventually make it up to the restaurant, they VALIDATE.  You have NEVER validated me!  Oh, thats right, you have surface parking, but dont try to pretend thats a feature with the temperature hitting 100!  Youre ridiculous. Whats that?  Does Five Guys have milkshakes?  Uh... hm.  Milkshakes.  I never thought about that.  They dont.  Would you mind if I got my burger and fries from there and then came to you for the shake?  No?  Fine.  Youre so overprotective and hyper-traditional sometimes.  Live a little. I hope we can still be friends, In n Out, but I just think I need to see other burgers.  Please dont pelt me with limp fries when I turn my back."
3,"We (my husband, 2 friends and I) visited Tavola last night because of a Yelp review. We werent as enthusiastic. The service was great! We ordered 2 pizzas and 2 salads. The salads were fresh, that was a nice surprise, not bagged. The pizza was good. Crust was a thicker than we like. Not a bad experience at all just not quite what we expected after the 5 stars."
2,"This place used to be quite good but I think they may have had an ownership change recently.  Over the past 12 months or so we have seen the quality of the food and service level both drop to unacceptable levels. The food is overall average - the fajitas down right poor and the drinks very inconsistent.  They do get somewhat busy with a bar crowd but that too seems inconsistent so when they do get busy the service gets very bad. When service deteriorates the Manager (or owner, Im not sure) seems to hide from customers.  Overall, make the trip down to Shea Blvd and find much better at better prices."
2,"Being a Phoenix native, I almost felt embarassed that I only ate at Petes for the first time seven years ago.  I had gotten back from England and was trying to recreate the orgasmic fish and chips experience I had there. Petes was around the corner from my complex and after all, I DID see so many  of those ""Im Addicted to Petes Fish & Chips"" bumper stickers all around Tempe. I had to try it. I ordered the two fish combo, and my reaction was...what the..?..are they serious?  1.) The ""chips"" suuuuck. No salt, overcooked and stiff. I couldnt even eat them.  2) The two squares of fish I got were alright, but I may as well have gone to Safeway and bought a box of Gortons fish sticks.  3.) The red ""special sauce"".  Wtf? And you have to pay extra if you want tarter? Lame.  4.) No malt vinegar. Enough said.  Why there is such a collective hard-on for this place is beyond me. Its a laughably bad example of Fish and Chips."
3,"I have been to this place twice and I have had both extremes.   The Good: Shannon, California Sea Bass, Michelle (Managers) Customer Service The Bad: Fried Calamari, Our last waiters breath The first visit to this establishment was our encounter with Shannon.  Shannon was a pure delight as our waitress.  She made our first visit absolutely fun.  My wife had a tilapia dish that she was less than enamored with but I had the California Sea Bass and that tasted very good.  In fact, it was so good that I regretted not getting a glass of Chardonnay to go with it.  The fish had a very nice texture and taste. Our second visit was our first encounter with the fried calamari.  As our guest so eloquently said, ""If this was my first impression of fried calamari, I would not have liked it.""  The calamari was overcooked and there was so much oil running on the plate.  We called this issue to Michelles attention and she agreed 100% that the dish was not prepared properly.  She gave us a coupon to come back there and eat at any time.   However, our waiters breath was another story. Whenever he spoke, I could smell his pungent (trust me, a lot better than what I really wanted to say) breath to the point I almost donned a gas mask.  There are very few things that would cause me to lose my appetite.  His malodorous breath and the calamari with more grease than a Jiffy Lube accomplished the feat."
5,"I will continue to give this place five stars for so many reasons.  First, the menu is very creative, and offers a great variety of healthy food, with an Asian twist.  This time I had the shrimp curry, which had lots of fresh vegetables, and instead of a heavy cream curry, it was a much healthier broth curry.  We had the edamame dumplings again, which were as good as I remembered.  It was kind of cool to see Dr. Weil eating there last night.  Its good to know that he likes the place enough to dine there."
3,Its Pei Wei. The service and food are always satisfactory.
5,"Im not normally one to jump at reviewing a chain restaurant, especially when there are 3 subways all within a couple blocks of each other.  I felt it was necessary in this case.  My husband and I came here over the weekend after a lovely trip to the dog park.  The two guys working here on the lonely afternoon were awesome.  They were really nice and friendly, and quite chatty.  One of them started helping my husband and the other one was sweeping while I was deciding.  The sweeping boy apparently noticed I was ready and he quickly ran to the back, washed his hands, threw on gloves and asked me what I wanted.  WOW!  This type of service has never happened at the other locations, all of which I have been too.  He chatted with me as I told him what I wanted.  He also joked about my weird sandwich and made me laugh.  Its refreshing to see a couple guys working on a boring day and actually enjoying themselves.  They also have outdoor seating which are perfect to sit at and people watch on beautiful days.  We even met this incredible 90 year old guy who is blind and deaf in both ears but somehow managed to communicate with us perfectly.  He was much more lively than most twenty-somethings you meet.  Amazing.  Only in downtown do you meet people like that.  This is a great Subway.  Go here and skip the others."
5,"I just went here for the first time a week ago (visiting my parents who just moved to FH). A++ Great location, view of the fountain, outside seating, nice decor inside, really wonderful owner and a big menu of pastries, croissant, sandwiches, Italian sodas, and coffee. I had the egg salad sandwich (the croissant and egg salad was SO FRESH!!) with a side of potato salad was probably one of the top 3 potato salads Ive ever had! I also got an iced mocha which was just the way I like it, on the sweet side. I had my 14 month old daughter with me so I also shared the potato salad with her and ordered a yogurt with granola.  This was no ordinary McDonalds yogurt parfait - it was so delicious I had to have some too! One gripe (that could be easily fixed by the owner) - PLEASE BUY ONE HIGHCHAIR for your guests to use.  We would love to come back often (as we go see grandma/grandpa) but I cant take another lunch with her on my lap:)"
1,"Let me preface this review ..I have lived in this area for 15 years and Chompies has been the only option for good Jewish deli. In my 51 years I have never received worse service than from Chompies They ALWAYS get the order wrong., Tonight after much debate I caved for my daughter who has strep throat. She wanted nothing else but matzah ball soup to make her feel better. So reluctantly I called in for take out at Chompies. I assumed the one thing on there menu that might be a safe bet and hard to screw up would be the soup. I returned home and called my daughter in to tell her I got what the doctor ordered. As I watched her pour it in the bowl we noticed it was missing one key ingredient......... THE SOUP!!!!!  When I decided to call and tell Chompies this has to be the 10th or 12 time in a row they have screwed up our order. This was more than screwing up a order. This was forgetting the soup in SOUP. They told me if I wanted the broth I should have asked for it in a separate container. I responded I didnt think I had to ask for broth in soup! I WILL NEVER GIVE THEM A DIME OF MY MONEY AGAIN.  I highly recommend to drive the additional 15-20 minutes in your car and find somewhere else when looking for jewish comfort food. You will be highly disappointed with Chompies. This is the first time I have ever heard of yelp. My son told me to come on here because this is a way to tell other people to avoid restaurants such as these. I hope you take my advice."
2,"Oy ve iz mir! Not to be a kvetch....but I consider myself to be an expert on Jewish delis.  As a New Yorker from a predominantly Jewish area and married to a Jew, Ive had more than my fair share of experiences at them.  My husband and I woke up this morning with a burning desire for a good bagel, corned beef on rye, and a knish.  So I schlepped all the way up to the PV Mall to get it. Ok, first of all, the decor is terribly schlocky.  Its kind of like the tourist trap Jewish deli you find in Times Square.  Its like a Disney version of a NY deli.   I take my number and head over to the cold case to get some drinks....of course they didnt have regular lemon Snapple (and why should they?  Its not like every deli, pizza place, and convenience store in NY carries it....) but they did have Dr. Browns Cel-Ray which is always a welcome sight.  Another thing they had in the cold case which I found to be odd were jars of Nathans pickles.  Nathans, like the hot dog place.  I would imagine a Jewish deli would have Ba Tampte pickles....I didnt even know Nathans made pickles!  It was a little lame to be honest. Anyways, I go up to the counter where there doesnt seem to be anyone working.  There was no organization to it.  So I waited.  And waited.  In New York, the deli is a finely tuned machine designed to move people quickly.  Chompies? Eh, not so much.  When I finally did place my order, the guy who took it had a hard time punching it into the computer and asked me to repeat it several times.  Despite saying I wanted my bagel toasted several times I was given a cold, untoasted bagel.  I waited a little longer for my order to come up and went on my merry way.   Here is the breakdown of the food we ordered- Matzoh ball soup- Surprisingly good.  I have never had matzoh ball soup with carrots and celery...so much chazerei!  Just give me the matzoh ball! Although, I will admit, it was solid.  I wouldnt go all the way to Chompies for it because I know that I can make it better in my own kitchen.  Plain bagel ""toasted"" with cream cheese- Terrible.  The bottom of the bagel was entirely too thick and was very hard.  They didnt even cut it all the way through, probably because the crust is too thick!  Corned beef on rye- Meh.  The corned beef wasnt very good, it wasnt corned enough.  If they make their own they didnt use a piece of brisket that was fatty enough.  The rye (which was not marble rye...) was lackluster.   It couldnt handle the corned beef, became soggy, and eventually fell apart.  The pickle it came with was the grossest thing Ive ever seen.  And it was definitely a kosher dill, even though I asked for a half sour.  The potato salad was actually really good though. Knish- Terrible.  The knishes in my elementary school cafeteria were better than this.  First of all, the outer crust was way too flimsy.  It should have been much, much, thicker, especially considering the gargantuan size of the knish.  We essentially ate a large plate of mashed potatoes.  The potato inside itself was unremarkable.  Not only do I have this Jewish thing going on but Im also Irish....Ive never met a potato dish I didnt like.  Until today.  I didnt even finish my half of the knish.  Now for the prices.  Whats with this meshugas?  $2.29 for a bagel with cream cheese is a tad much.  In NY they run you about $1.35.  The corned beef sandwich was $12.50!  Now, Ive paid that much for sandwiches in NY before but you get 2 lbs of meat and several layers of sandwich!  This was not a $12.50 sandwich.  I was also going to get us some whitefish salad to sample but at $15.99/lbs it wasnt happening.   Why anyone should schlep all this way, in this heat, schvitzing all over, for this dreck?  I dont know!"
4,"Great place, great food, great environment ."
5,Excellent
4,This hole in the wall quite possible has the best Chinese food in Phoenix. Deffinitely the best Wor Won Ton soup and pork Egg Foo Young. Great for carry out and they have a large delivery area!
5,"Place is awsome.  Got the beef cheesesteak and everything was great.  The bread was possibly the best I have ever had.  Price was pretty good.  Just over 9 bucks for a whole sammich and soda.  While waiting I walked around and I plan on going back for some shopping.  Lots of pasta, sauces and just about anything you could want for Italian food.  5 stars all the way."
5,"Updating my review after several weeks. Appears maybe the managers read these reviews. In the last few weeks this store has improved 2 stars. The eggs in my BBs have been cooked perfectly, Diet Coke tastes better and they have not forgotten anything in all my visits. Added two stars because they have been consistently 5 stars since my last review...but I am still watching."
4,"I needed to grab a bite on a day in the office, so I thought Id take a little trek over to Sandwich Club. Lots of my former co-workers would tell me that they loved the food here. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by the owner. A super cool dude. He promptly asked if it was my first time there, and he asked where I was from. I like a little small talk before a sandwich. In any case, I ended up going with a no-mayo tuna salad sandwich. Do you remember that time in junior high when you saw a pretty girl and you never had the guts to go talk to her? But your friends dared you to do it? The no-mayo tuna salad is the pretty girl. I dare you to try it. Its amazing. The capers and lemon juice make this so flavorful. Youll be holding hands with this, and it will grace your lips in no time....unlike that girl from Jr. High who secretly despised you because you were fat. Oh wait. The menu seems quite diverse, with many sandwich options, and they also make crepes. The food tasted great, the service was great. Id definitely come back for more and try something else. Afterall....who doesnt love a good sandwich!"
5,"I walked here in the heat and was immediately greeted with an ice cold beer. For free! It was a delicious IPA and the staff couldnt have been friendlier. There were even snacks. I also had another sample of their Camelback ale. Both were heaping samples, almost a full cup. The tour was fun and informative. The co owner George even gave me and my boyfriend a ride to the lightrail stop!! We didnt bring our bikes. So awesome.  Definitely recommend. Lovely way to spend a Saturday afternoon."
4,"I have a cooking problem- I cant do it. However, I loved coming to Entrees to Go to make our meals. My husband bought a Groupon for this place and we decided to try it out. It was a wonderful experience, and that means a lot coming from me since I am not a fan of cooking.  I love the concept of Entrees to Go. You prepare your meal at this place and bring them home in a baggie.  Meals ready to cook and no mess in my kitchen = awesomeness! Everything you need to know to prepare your food is explained and if you have any questions they are answered immediately.  The only downfall...The price w/o a Groupon is a little pricey. Three full size entrees (each entree serving 4-6) is regularly $80. Its great if you work full-time and dont have time to cook on your own but its a little high for my pocketbook. However, if money wasnt a factor I would cook every meal at Entrees to Go.  Loved it!"
4,"I came to this place for my birthday celebration with my fiance and another couple. I was definitely in a good mood. THE FOOD First, the salad bar. I am not much of a veggie lover, but the selection here is impressive, especially in light of this being a place where you eat the cow, not the cows food. Besides a variety of veggies and dressings, you have a few cold cut meats, cheeses and smoked salmon to select from. From personal experience, tomatoes are good, all cheeses and meats are too. Salmon was simply delicious. For the main course, its all sorts of meat, mostly varieties of beef plus lamb and chicken. I liked all of them, but most of the beef was a salty to my taste (hence the loss of a star). Some of it can be explained by my getting the first cut off the meat several times, which meant that I got the salt seasoning in addition to the salt in the meat.  That aside, the meat is high quality and the main objective here is to remember not to get too much too soon, so you can enjoy everything the place has to offer. Sides were small (as they should be) and included polenta, mashed potatoes and fried bananas. All good. The wine selection is extensive and from our limited tasting, quite good. We had Cabernet and malbec. SETTING This is a rather large stand alone restaurant, but has surprisingly personal feeling, especially if you consider the amount of staff running around. It is not too brightly lit and has generally darker tones to the interior. There is also a cozy bar to the side of the main entrance that is a pleasant place to wait for others to arrive. SERVICE Attentive and not at all pushy. OVERALL I came here in a good mood and left in an even better mood and feeling like a python after eating a cow. Which was close enough to true amount of food in me. Highly recommend this both for the experience and the food itself."
2,"I went to NOCA about a month after is opened and was wowed. I told all my fellow foodies about my wonderful experience, the innovative menu and all the little extras that made the meal a really special dining experience in Phoenix.  I went back with friends twice after in the coming months and was pleased each time.  I just went back this past Saturday though, and would have to say I would no longer suggest it for a special night out. It was as if the magic was gone and that the place was showing its age and loosing its ""specialness"". It was really just ok. The chefs talent shows, but too many other let downs.  When we arrived for our 8:30 reservation the place was crowded. The host was friendly and told us that our table would be ready soon and it was. We sat down at our table and thats when things started turning out not as well as expected. Seated in a back corner--which I did not mind---I noticed the walls were filthy---scratched and beat up and dirty. That was my view, so of course its all I could focus on. The waiter did not show up for 5 min. to take our drink order, and when he did it took 20 min. to get them to us. He apologized, but at 8:45 on a Saturday night that waiting for a first drink is not fun.  When then settled down with our menus and picked our choices. It was then we were told that they were out of the veal --which of course 2 of us had chosen by then, and that there was only one Skate dish--which of course the other 2 of us had decided on. They were also out of 3 other items. I felt I was back in the old Eleve (located in this same spot)--the food was great there as well---when they did not run out of many items on the menu. They may be ok when you have a larger menu, but with a small menu to begin with this is a real disappointment.  Gone were the pop rocks that I thought was so fun as an intermezzo, instead a spoon of something that was not described was set down in front of us. A simple salad--good--was $15---and most starters are at least that much. Good, but not worth the price. Otherwise, entrees were good--not special, but tasty and served with good presentation. The cotton candy is still there--and still an attention getter. And I still love the desert selections---especially the malt that I had with mini doughnuts in with dipping sauces.  I think I am able to overlook the fact that its really not an attractive room--the energy from the kitchen and the close tables add noise and excitement to the room, but the art and lighting is ugly and now that its starting to look run down as well--there are too many new, beautiful places in the city with equally good food and equally as pricey that are not in strip mall. And they usually still have most menu selections on a Saturday night."
4,"Since this is a Kimpton Hotel my standards are fairly high.  The reception area and pool are very well done, in typical Kimpton fashion. The rooms are nice, however could use more work. The bathrooms are completely remodeled, but the little amenities that Im use to like the Ipod docking station, flat screen tv, cordless phone, room service past 11pm and multiple outlets (im an electronics junkie) just arent there. The room really feels like any other average hotel.  The spa was lovely, but it is not a full spa. I was hoping to sit in the steam room before my 90min massage, but unfortunately there wasnt one to sit in. The massage room was nice and the largest I had ever been in. It had its own private bath/changing room and a large copper tub close to the actual massage table. I was pretty bummed I didnt add a bath to my massage.  All in all I would stay here again since its in a great location. Plus, the guys at the bell desk will give you a ride (within 3 miles) in a Cadillac Escalade free of charge. That was a great when it came time to partying at night!"
4,"Well, i was very excited to go to this event, however, not so excited when it was all over. The music was great and it is a very nice place. It really reminds me of Vegas. However, it  was fashion week and we all thought that we would see models sashaying down the runway. But, no. No fashion at all. The wine was comp and it was very good ,i give great praise for that!  But the samples of food were few and far between. The Servers skipped out many times. Not like most Yelp events which are usually out the door GREAT!  We ordered from the happy hour menu.  I fully agree lots of salt, but i think it was the soy sauce, it was the most salty..i have ever had. There is very little parking here as well so be prepared for that as well.  All in all we had a good time.But, not as fabulous as most Yelp events."
5,"Totally worth the drive from Scottsdale. The food is delicious, and is not pre-packaged, such a nice change for a coffee joint. Support local business, Starbucks has nothing on Lux; other than a million locations."
2,"I judge a soul food place by its fried chicken, a donut shop by its old fashioned, an ice cream place by its vanilla, and a Greek place by its gyros.  The gyros here are bland and wholly unspectacular - and sourced from the same frozen food purveyor (Sysco?) as every other gyro stop in Phoenix.  The cloyingly thick pita didnt help either. I dont know why it is so challenging to find a legitimate rotating spit gyro in this town - but it is.  Especially near downtown Phoenix. Recommendations welcome."
1,"OVERPRICED & DECEITFUL & RUDE! I should have read the reviews before I came here! I took a bridesmaid dress in to have the top taken in like 1/4 inch, not much. I asked her, how much will this cost? She assured me it would not be ""much"". It was $60 and she hardly did a thing, cant even steam it there. I was irate but calmly asked her if she could charge less and she screamed NO! She said its because the dress cost more. Yeah...like that matters A guy was there dropping off pants that needed taken OUT which is a lot more work, she charge him $18.50 for each pair. I dont know if that is good for pants a lot but her pricing scale seems way off! Previously Ive been to 5th Avenue Alterations and they charge me $50 for a floor length brdiesmaid dress that they took in the whole thing AND steamed it. Theyre also polite and will work with you on pricing and communicate with you beforehand. Definitely worth the few extra minutes of a drive!!"
5,"SAKE    *Japanese alcoholic beverage made from fermented rice; usually served hot . ( Full disclosure : I dont like sake) Parents in Scottsdale for a first look at the new house / neighborhood. We were on the horns of a dilemma : ? Would a mid week , early season dinner at the club be too quiet? Should we  descend south of  the Frank Loyd Wright  into south - north Scottsdale....?? We opted for the safe bet - booked a car and headed south to the Ocean Club. ** A) never drink and drive in Scottsdale ( or anywhere else for that matter) **B) if youre a foreigner - never- ever drink and drive in Scottsdale **C) A + B refer to you Nikolai Khabibulin  (( A nod of support to the YELP community . After perusing the Ocean Club reviews retrospectively I believe the correlation existing between the posted notes and reality to be around 0.90 Well Done!! ( I would go as high as a correlation of 0.95 if high and low marks were thrown out ( similar to olympic skating or gymnastics))) We arrived at the club---- a good bar crowd ( not quite as Mountain lioness(y) as i had expected (? hoped?) -- ? mid week perhaps...?, a good blend of hipsters , hobos and Mrs Lovey Howell IIIs  ( score +1 for the Ocean Club) We were promptly seated - at a good table - well positioned , near the back and partially curtained - nice. ( score + 1 for the Ocean Club) The waiter then promptly arrived to take our drink orders: Now - I dont like Sake ( see note above) - but on occasion - I like to fancy myself as the kind of guy who may indeed like Sake- hence , I order a Grey Goose Sake Martini - "" I have no Sake"" the waiter announces sadly. Now - this is tricky - can I in good conscience penalize the establishment for not having a beverage that I really dont like or want in the first place? Too bad for you Ocean Club cause yes I can. ( score -1 for the Ocean Club) The drinks arrive - I have opted for Grey Goose sans Sake and yes -sweet Jesus  they are huge ( see prior posts). ( score + 1 for the Ocean Club) The waiter then arrives to review the menu and describe the specials- This he does without note , blackboard , evening card or inked cheat note on his wrist- He recites for what seems to be forever... It is like a reading from the old testament - but instead of a mere chapter of the book of Leviticus - he recites the entire book.... I am captivated ....( or is it the Grey Goose) ?? does he really know the name of the Italian girl who dug this evenings truffles up in Piedmont...?? ?? does he really know the glove size of the Japanese ranch worker who massaged the Wagyu beef and from which prefecture he hailed...?? ( if so - why didnt he have him send me some Sake....??) at any rate - I am entertained ( score + 1 for the Ocean Club) The food arrives - the portions are huge and the flavors sublime.

4,"My hubby and I have been fans of Roys since our first time at the flagship location on Oahu . . . and weve watched him expand to the mainland. Our experience with the mainland Roys have been hit and miss, but the Marriott Desert Ridge location pretty much knocks it out of the park! We went at the tail end of Arizona Restaurant Week. We really liked the menu options for this special week, and the warm chocolate souffle cake is always out of this world . . . If that was the only thing that tasted good, then we would feel we got our moneys worth . . . but we didnt have to worry about it because everything was perfect from beginning to end. We had an adorable server who had a great personality and excellent people skills. She was unassuming and let us linger between courses. As I am a stickler about food coming out too soon after just finishing one course, this was just perfect! And so relaxing. The ambiance on the patio, which is where we chose to sit, almost felt as if we were on one of the islands, not in the middle of the desert . . . with the tiki torches lit and the sound of the babbling water features throughout the resort, it came pretty close . . . it was just missing the trade winds.  The resort had a band playing as well . . . they were pretty good, a few ups and downs. I would have loved if the music was a little more subtle than the pop-jazz mix they were playing . . . oh, but I have digressed.  My hubby and his daughter chose the restaurant week menu. Hubby had the Grilled Szechuan Spiced Pork Ribs Smoked & Glazed in Roys Original Mongolian Sauce. A bit cliche, but they were finger lickin good! My step-daughter and I shared the Crispy Spicy Ahi Sushi Roll with Ginger Wasabi Beurre Blanc -- it was huge and almost a meal. The rolls were fresh, crunchy, and had a little kick . . . not too spicy. It was a good thing I agreed to help her with it! For entrees, my hubby had the Roys Original Hawaiian Blackened Island Ahi with Spicy Soy Mustard Butter Sauce. It, too, was an ample portion of tender ahi that was complimented by the sauce but no overpowered by it. My step-daughter had the Roys Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi with Maine Lobster Essence. Another nice portion of perfectly cooked Mahi.  We all were starting to feel the aloha spirit . . . I had to be the exception by ordering off the regular menu and chose my most favorite entree of all . . . the Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish . . . Aah, what a delight, so melt-in-your-mouth delicate . . . I was in island heaven. Desserts were total home runs -- the melting hot chocolate souffle is mandatory for any chocolate lover. In fact, it tastes the same at every Roys weve been to . . . it never disappoints. A total surprise . . . and a delightful one . . . was the chocolate coconut cheesecake which came with a side of mango sorbet . . . or did she say it was pineapple sorbet . . . whatever . . . it was the perfect accompaniment to the light and fluffy cheesecake. We also ordered a bottle of Newton claret which was a modestly priced wine and as my husband said as he swirled and sipped it . . . ""I know my wines . . . "" Having to always be the exception, I ordered the he Original Hawaiian Martini, which was what I considered my dessert. It was a juicy combination of Maui pineapple, vodka and coconut rumMMMMM! It was truly a beautiful evening from start to finish. You may be asking why I didnt give it five stars then if there were no misfires . . . that five star is reserved for Roys Hawaiian restaurants that really do create the aloha experience with some special touches only that can only be enjoyed there!"
4,Just happened to be in the neighborhood when we saw this BBQ place.  The pulled pork and beef did not disappoint.  The sandwiches can be called hardy portions on large buns.  The sauce was excellent.  The place is very clean.  Very good service.  Was not impressed with the coleslaw - seemed flat.  Will return as the high ratings of this establishment are well deserved.
5,"Hands down, best slices in Scottsdale...."
2,"Ive been here twice...the first time was driven by a rumor that they made their own root beer.  Im a sucker for homemade root beer, so I had high hopes that this place would become a favorite.  My husband and I were so excited when these huge glasses of RB hit the table!!  And then confusion...both of us looked at each other and said ""WTF???""  Worst RB EVER! What the heck was in this drink that made it taste like ass?  We looked all over the menu and found nothing.  Then we saw the ""fine print"" on a small table sign...STEVIA.  Its made with Stevia NOT sugar...Im sorry, but I have to say that this is the lame-est root beer on the planet.  If Im going to treat myself to a big glass of homemade root beer, I want it to be delectable...sugar and all...no freaking high fructose corn syrup and no bloody artificial sugars (and yes, I know stevia is ""natural"" but who gives a crap...it tastes terrible anyway). After the root beer debacle, it didnt get better.  The food was meh...service was not so great (there were moments of ""is she ever coming back???"").  Id say, go here for the beer, sans root, but thats about it.  Otherwise, skip this place and drive out to Four Peaks...youll be happier all around."
2,"The actual restaurant is fine, the service is friendly and good. I am not going to go in to the food other than to say, no. Oh well $340 bucks and all I can muster is a no."
5,I love this store!  They have an amazing staff and the most modern clothes!  I set my appointments with a few of the employees and I always get compliments on my outfits when I go out!!  Hats off to the Ted Baker team in Scottsdale Fashion Square!
5,"I love this PHO and spring rolls, and for the friendly and fast service plus its cheap! Oh its truly a must try place."
4,love the gyro plate. Rice is so good and I also dig their candy selection :)
4,"went for lunch today with my girlfriend.  i had the chicken tacos and she had the mahi tacos.  you get three little tacos per order.  we switched one for one.  the chicken was freakin great.  i had a small chicken bone and some cartilidge in mine and i still loved it.  seasoned well and dressed well with an adobo sauce, maybe.  it had some green cabbage, some sliced fresno peppers and what i think was manchego.    i loved it.  the girl had fried mahi tacos  (they offered the option of grilled rather than fried).  it was good, had some remoulade and the same cabbage and fresnos on it.  it was all good.  the service, the food, the atmosphere, and the whole package.  go here, eat here.  be happy.  quality over quantity. always.  well done mission staff, well done"
4,"Good food in a unique setting with fantastic service.  Nobou at Teeter House offers up a very pleasurable dining experience. Ill start with the great.  The restaurant is in a more than 100-year-old house in the heart of downtown Phoenix.  There is nearly a perfect feeling that I have been invited inside someones home for a fancy dinner party.  The staff was fantastic.  Our server, Alexis, was very attentive, friendly, fast, and really knew the menu (or at least was good at selling every dish with a very thorough description about the technique and flavors used to create it).  The presentation of the food is creative and beautiful.  The not-so-great.  The food is served in small portions at a high price.  I wouldnt have a big problem with that, I actually think Americans should be more into tapas eating, except nothing we ordered blew my mind or taste buds away.  Dont get me wrong; everything we ordered was excellent.  The food is perfectly cooked, seasoned, sauced, and artistically plated.  It just didnt have that over-the-top ""WOW"" factor I was hoping for. Having said that.  Nobuo at Teeter House is still a place that everyone should try out at least once.  Its an enjoyable place to eat.  Its probably a fun place to go with a small group of friends just to hang out, order a lot of plates and just sample what the restaurant has to offer. As I said, the price can be a little high.  It took five plates and a dessert to create a fair size meal for just two people.  That came to nearly a $100 tab (with drinks).  But Nobuo at Teeter House is on Local Dines (http://www.localdines.com/?ref=19485) with a $50 or $25 gift certificate.  Take advantage of the deal and cross Nobuo off your Phoenix restaurant bucket list."
5,"I love guerreros!  I worked in Mesa 15 years ago and we did burrito runs here all the time. Im a huera, but my Hispanic pals all rated this place authentic.  Its a husband and wife team that runs it.  The best thing are the beans - incidentally, thats how I rate the authenticity of Mexican fare- They are the kind of beans I ate in Nogales during college (at a place I could only locate while intoxicated).  Thinner, lighter colored, and delicious compared to any Ive EVER had this side of the border.  I live in PV now- super far - but after this I think Im gonna have to take a road trip tomorrow to Mesa! Yum!"
4,"I dig the Vig. Good food and a great atmosphere/patio. If you like Bocce Ball, then you should definitely check it out, but go soon before it starts to warm up again and be sure to take the Vig Rig home if youre blasted."
1,"A couple Saturdays ago, went with my mom to get my name added to her accounts should the unthinkable happen. We first went to Chase which took all of ten minutes. The personal banker was great - in-out-done.  Then we headed to her Credit Union at approximately 10:00 AM. They were quite busy, apparently. When we checked in, I heard grumbling from other customers and asked the wait time.  I was told there were two people ahead of us in line and it ""shouldnt be long."" 30 minutes later, my mom went to ask how much longer it would take. Jennfer, who was manning the reception desk, dismissed her rudely in front of a lobby of customers. My mom is as sweet as tea in Tennesee, so to hear her called out in front of a lobby of people as a disruption was upsetting.  45 minutes later, I went up to ask if it would be much longer. Jennifer said curtly, ""Were busy."" Apparently, on Saturdays, theyre busy and one should avoid transacting business there on the weekend. I dont recall being spoken to so rudely at even a fast food restaurant in recent years... Another ten minutes or so went by (as did my deadline to make another appointment I had made), I was told it would be ""two more minutes"", as I had to go through their background check to be a member. They were having a difficult time with my Washington Driver License and the weird characters it has (an asterisk in part of the number). After all was said and done, over an hour later, I was approved to be a member and was successfully put as a signer on my moms account. I asked for Jennifers card, as I told her I was not happy with the way she had spoken to me or my mother, and I intended to speak with her manager.  To that I received a reply she did not have one. The woman sitting next to her informed me she was the assistant manager and that they were busy on Saturdays. My biggest beef was this: If it was going to be an hour to speak with someone, tell me. I can make other arrangements or come in during the week. Being told first, ""It shouldnt be long,"" and then, ""Were busy"" is not an excuse. If the business is so overwhelming on Saturdays, perhaps it would be wise to staff more people, extend the hours, or inform people of the wait theyre likely to experience because of the queue. Or dont open on Saturdays! As a 20 year veteran of the service industry, I am very disappointed at the level of service Arizona Federal Credit Union provided my mom and me, but also all the other people I watched be dismissed like the Credit Union was doing them a favor. After doing some searching for a new home for moms money, she can get a much better rate at a (four letter word forthcoming) BANK! Im normally a big fan of member-owned institutions, but based on the incredibly rude serviced I received from Arizona Federal Credit Union, Id say go to a Credit Union or Bank where the employees actually read the mission statement that is painted on the wall behind them."
4,confirmed better than subway blimpie quiznos etc etc Not really much else to say that hasnt been said above. Wished they had more vegetarian options :(
5,"Service is good... The newer waitors tend to forget youre there. Food is delicious, never gotten food poisoning... Cheesecake is magnificent... The best kind is the Godiva, expensive bit worth it!"
2,"Played today, course in decent shape for the money.  Would be nice if they would educate groundskeepers on not running mower up to you when trying to play.  Also would be nice if beverage service would continue after 4 oclock.  Course was packed play was slow and no beverage service.  Called in but pro shop phones shut off at 4 30 .  No ranger on course either to keep groups moving ended up not finishing eighteen,teed off at 12 30."
5,"I really adore this place. Theyve got some of the best lentil soup around and all of their chicken dishes have been perfectly seasoned and very, very juicy. I recently got the kabob plate and it came out so tender and juicy it was falling apart on my fork. Their hummus and garlic sauce are both very good as well and the service is quick and friendly.  Last time I was in, I noticed they expanded their dining section so the place is a bit bigger now, probably to accommodate the increase in customers from the park-and-ride light rail station right in front of their restaurant. Do yourself the favor. If youre heading on the light rail and feel hunger strike, stop off here and enjoy a nice meal. They have good lunch specials around $7.50 for a full plate with meat, hummus, garlic sauce, pita, and tabouli. Mmmm!"
2,"For some reason, these people seem to think its OK to price a tank top, that probably has less thread count than my thong and cost about 17cents of labor to make, at $50.  They also seem to think that dressing up their mannequins like paraplegic color and pattern blind grandmas gives them business. Oh wait...it does! Because this is Tempe. And Tempe, as I cant over-repeat, is the devil."
5,"Cheese Curds!   They have been so hard to find in AZ.    Like the Jalepeno ones too. Really good fresh milk.   Worth the stop. Bring cash, not credit or debit cards"
4,"Tried this place for weekday lunch.  We arrived before noon and good thing since they have a big lunch crowd.  (not to worry, plenty of parking in back and seating outside w/ misters)  Kudos to Aric and Monica for stopping by our table several times to make sure service was great or they fixed it.  We started with the Bruchetta, which was piled high.  The we had the Smokey (arugula & smoked prosciutto) and the Marg pizzas. Almost had the Pabst on tap, but went for the Dunkel since its harder to find.  As if the food wasnt enough, the decor and ambiance was over the top.  The herb garden as you walk in and the bar with the salon chairs was a nice touch.  Cant wait to go back."
1,Like watching a train wreck in slow motion will definitely be going somewhere else for bagels from now on disappointing have been going there for years.  The eight day old cream cheese was a nice touch (yuck!)
3,"This club has great bands.  I saw 68 Guns and Metal Elvis here.  Also at the Metal Elvis show was a Van Halen tribute band called VH Too.  The music is top notch and it is usually not too crowded so you can go right up to the stage.  However, there are only a few tables, which is annoying if you need a place to put your drink or coat or something.  I also wish the ceilings were a bit higher.  Would be better if they could combine an indoor/outdoor area with the stage.  Overall the building seems cramped, small and old.  The prices are reasonable though.  The location is kind of strange however.  We took a cab there but when we wanted to leave we couldnt get one to come pick us up despite the staff saying they called one.  Finally we walked to a gas station and called from there.  This reminds me too much of Club Red.  Great bands, crappy club.  I hope that someone opens a brand new club for bands of this caliber.  Or else I will need to open one myself."
5,I love the menu here it has many selections of many cultures including Italian!!!
4,"We stopped in here on a hot summer afternoon, grumpy because we had been on a wild goose chase for mint. Couldnt find it anywhere, like Frys, Bashas, or TJs, even in those teeny tiny overpriced little packages. They have it here in big bunches for something ridiculous like 59 cents. Since we had friends coming over for mojitos, this made me happy! Its just about mojito season again, so Ill be headed back to this location. The produce section was large and had some good-looking stuff in it. The location isnt really too scary."
4,"Some buddies and I went to Scottsdale for a golfing boondoggle last week and a couple of guys in the know directed us to The Mission. DANG! We let our server, Jonathan, drive the car so to speak.  He quizzed us on our likes and dislikes and brought us our orders (we didnt specifically order).  We had 7 people in our group and every plate was spot on.   We started with the chicken (thigh) tostadas and the crispy cola pork belly tostadas.  They were great; particularly the pork belly ones.  MAN were those good.  My dinner was the Chorizo Porchetta which brought a big hunk of slow cooked pork that shredded beautifully.  Along side this hunka hunka porky love was a salt block carrying 10 small corn tortillas to build little tacos from.  Some tasty accompaniments: sauce, onion, & cilantro, finished the presentation.  It was a fantastic dish.  The other 6 dishes were just as great.  To note: the honey chipotle grits that my buddy got were super tasty.  Especially when you dumped some of their ghost chili sauce (forget what it was called).  Desert was the Pumpkin bread pudding (YUM!) and fried bananas.   All in all, a fantastic place.  Really good."
4,"The Good:  Really good burger. Good fries. The Bad: Terrible paint and lighting. Cant even hang out for long. (Maybe that is the idea.) Dont like high booth stalls much. JMHO of course. Also a note to the sewage smell that others noted. That little area on that side of the mall has smelled like hell for years for some odd reason. It sucks for the businesses, but I assure you it has nothing to do with Smashburger alone nor should it cause any health concerns. Just luck of the draw on a bad sewer vent problem. Update: 4/18/10 Went again. Really very good. Decor is still not my fav but the food is solid. Like I said, it is the juiciest burger I have had in a while. Shoestring fries are kill. Upped from 3 stars to four."
3,"I finally tried Spicy Pickle last week. I like the name and was intrigued about their menu. Paninis, soups, salads, pizzetas, nothing out of the ordinary. I had a half sandwich ( Sausalito Bandido?), half salad combo ( Spinach salad). Food was fresh and good. The sandwich could have stand a little more meat, it was truly flat. The salad was crisp and dressing was on the side, which I appreciated.   On my way out I got a chocolate chip cookie that was OK. I love cookies and they have to be pretty bad for me not to like them. This one, I kid you not, must have had maybe 3-4 chocolate chips? So if youre craving chocolate, this is not the cookie for you."
5,"Such strange combinations of flavors, yet they taste so good.  Weve been here three or four times and are never disappointed."
4,"Delux makes good burgers, but you probably figured that out already. They also have good fries (sweet and regular potato thank you very much). They are kinda expensive. If I have to compare it to something I would compare it to California Pizza Kitchen. Better than a regular Pizza, but probably not worth the cost."
1,"There are few resources in Arizona for dancers, actors and performers, so its best to order online if you have the time to wait for shipping. Dees Dancewear is overpriced and because they know they are the only game in town, their customer service (and return policies) have suffered. In an emergency situation, youre better suited going to Mischas Dancewear on 33rd Ave and Bell or Capezios in Scottsdale. Otherwise, order online and steer clear of this establishment when possible."
4,"This place is awesome!  Where else can you hear incredible live jazz music for free on a Monday night with reasonably priced drinks?  Any other major city (like, say, New York), the cover would be at least $15, and they would make you pay for the second set, as well, and a place to sit or stand with a decent view of the musicians would be hard to come by, and by the end of the night you would end up feeling ripped off.   Granted, this place can get crowded on the weekends, but no wonder.  The beer (no draft) and wine selection is good, the vibe is laid-back, and the music Ive heard has been great (Ive only see one group here--Jiggle--and they play jazz.) Tip for music-lovers:  Sit or stand in the room where the music is.  Sitting any farther back and you may be tempted to take a swing at the people who just come to chat and fail to understand what makes the Lost Leaf so unique.  But do give them a bit of a break.  They are, after all, probably ""paying"" for your cover charge with all their imbibing of alcohol."
4,"Well, Ive been to Liberty Market several times now and its time to add my two cents. Yes, I know, there are already 250+ Reviews, what more could I add? Dont worry, Ill stick to the facts; consider this the cliff-notes version. Take the first parking spot you can find or drive the the lot west of the building. Walk in, grab a menu, and get in line.  With all of the goodness on the menu, try to make your decision before you get to the register.   A few of my favorites 1. CORTADITO - coffee drinkers, do NOT miss this one!  Cuban miro-latte, on the sweeter side, served in a pair of espresso shots or a bowl, perfection! 2. Rancher Salad - steak, caramelized onions, blue cheese, arugula, do I have to keep going? 3. Sweet Potato Salad - a unique salad, SO much better than your average potato salad 4. Cinnamon Rolls the size of a human face, if youre into to that kind of thing, share with a friend, or four. there are more, but I promised to keep it short. Back to the line. As youre making up your mind, be ready to answer the number of people in your party so they can set you up with a table.  Try to resist the incredible looking, super-sized pastries and desserts in the case, or not, what the heck, just get it!.  Pay the friendly cashier, proceed to the fountain drink station to fill your glasses, and maneuver the maze of tables to find the one with your number. Just a few tips.  One, it can get a little noisy in there, so may not be the best place if youre planning a discussion over your meal. Two, LM gets busy and the staff is always trying to find a table for the guests in line by the time they finish at the register.  So, while the dining room attendants are friendly and attentive, they are definitely trying to turn the table as soon as youll let them. And now you know what to expect.  If you dont like lines or loud places, this might not be your favorite place. Overall, delicious, fresh food and shinny, happy people to bring it to you.  Lets just say LM is enough to get me out of my five mile Ahwatukee radius, and that is hard to do! Now you know the scoop . . . Im out!  Enjoy!"
1,"The cheesy breadsticks were delicious.  Everything else, not so much."
5,very wonderful and romantic place to take your loved one :)
4,"Oooooh, I liked it, very much so!  Just sad that I didnt get to try more of its myriad offerings, especially the pizza.  We enjoyed a lovely brunch here on a Friday.  Cute little place, lots of ambiance, good people watching (quite the hopping place on this midsummer day), tasty food.  We had a round of Bloody Marys, and those were nicely done, as well.  A great spot to just hang and nosh and chitchat with friends."
4,"One of the best sports bars in the valley. Tons of screens (although some of the big screen projectors could be updated). Nice big drafts and the food is always tasty. Try the teriyaki chicken sandwich with fries its awesome. Upstairs they have shuffleboard and pool tables. Golden tee 2009 downstairs with another pool table. If you like loud sports bars where the patrons get into the game this is the spot to go. Plenty of fun to be had. People say too many kids but I guess I go later on at night and never have seen a problem with little kids.?. The service is on and off here, sometimes its been great sometimes its been useless."
4,"Could use a remodeling job, but the food is really good for the area.  The wait staff is very attentive, and the free chips and hot sauce for dipping, are REALLY GOOD.  The fajitas are my usual.  Worth the visit and youll leave satisfied."
5,"Very friendly staff, or a fast food place-- their customer service and friendliness is unmatched.. I go more often than not simply because of the experience every time! Thanks Micky!"
5,"I cant believe this wasnt reviewed yet!  This place rocks, and Dr. Heather is the very best vet in town. Shes reasonable in price, thorough in her evaluations, and super kind. She handled the life and death issues so carefully and warmly, and she talks about her own pets and has compassion!  When our cat Everett died, she not only called us throughout the whole cremation process, but she sent a card and when we picked up the ashes - she had made a single footprint ""ornament"" with a ribbon and his name on it as a gift.  Never had a vet do anything so kind.   We have had MANY cats and MANY VETS.  I know a good vet. Go here. Please go here!"
5,"I can always count on Sacks.   It is always fresh and always tasty and the sandwiches are so creative that years later Im still not sure how they get those fabulous blends and tastes that they do.   I try to hit lunch a little off the lunch hour and then the crowds are not so bad and I can find parking but, its worth it to eat a little latter when I know the meal will be so satisfying I can go back to work and be so productive.   Sacks is my ""go to place"" when I have a guest or friend that I want to be well fed and satisfied too."
3,"Food is great, but service is horrible.  The servers are rude and it took a 30 minutes to get our drinks and another 30 for our food. I really liked this place when it first opened.  We live in the area and had hoped for this to be a regular place for us to come to eat, drink and meet friends. I hope the management fixes the problem with the service.  If you are going to try this place, I suggest you sit at the bar for better service."
2,"dragged my husband here because the menu online lists a particular kind of spring roll that i love. and when we show up, the menu was TOTALLY different.  this place is geared toward your typical Arizona-white crowd. its pretty watered down Viet food, and was sorely disappointing. and expensive. boo. go across the street to Mekong if you prefer better tasting, more authentic Viet food."
5,"I have been shopping at Lee Lees for over ten years.  The store stocks Chinese, Malaysian, Korean, Japanese, West Indian and other foods.  You can usually find what you are looking for here.   The fish selection is vast, fresh and reasonably priced.   They have the finest selection of noodles and yerba mate tea!!! Enjoy"
3,"Ive gotten lunch take out here a few times. The only thing Ive tried is the drunken noodles. While I think they are pretty decent, I have been having serious issues getting the right spicy-nes. The first time I got them, I asked for level 3 spicy. Their spice meter goes from 0-5. I love love hot and spicy Thai food, however these noodles were practically inedible. Yet, they were so delicious at the same time I devoured the entire thing. And I felt like I was going to die later, as my stomach felt like a fishnet stocking... The second time I ordered them I asked for level 2 spicy. This time they were not spicy at all. At all!! They were so bland. I mean, they still tasted good, but were missing that drunken noodle kick! So, at this point I dont know what to do. Obviously every cook there must have a different idea of what each number means.  The last time I ordered from here, I simply said drunken noodles. I didnt specify a spicy level. I figured maybe this would give me the perfect in between spicy that I so desired! Well, when I got them, they were more bland than the level 2. And tasted kinda weird.  I will give them another try as they are right across the street from my work, and I hope we can work out our spicy issues!  4 stars for the service, theyre really friendly here 2 stars for the food, until we can work out our issues And 4 stars for the convenience!"
4,"When Im looking for the more mature, laid back version of Lux, I come to Copper Star. Coffee is not as good but service is great and place is inviting. Great neighborhood favorite."
4,"This place is very off-the-beaten-track, Im sure most people overlook it....I only came across it whilst searching online for somewhere different to eat...and when I came across the review on the Phoenix New Times website(http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2005-02-10/dining/sultans-of-shish/), I knew this was it... I only docked a star for the (extremely) sparse decor and atmosphere...this place could have been any other type of business with just a change of sign and omission of tables... anyway, the food was great! my fiance ordered skewers of beef and lamb(Im not too keen on lamb, but the beef was tender and succulent...very well spiced!)...I had a cucumber salad(diced, along with onions and parsley, and soaked in vinegar-lemon juice), which enchanted me so much that I created my own version at home and make it every time I feel like doing a bit of dicing(msg me for the recipe--its a bit death-breathy and labor-intensive but delicious!)... and, during dessert, I could see why Samarkand was voted Best Tea in Phoenix...the black tea was easily the best Ive ever had(besides a special brand of blue ginger tea I make a point to keep my cabinet stocked with)...it was strong and rich...absolutely incredible! definitely make it a point to search this place out--its worth the effort!"
4,"I cant believe Ive never reviewed this place before. Ive been here countless times before, and watched the place get upgraded and remodeled several years ago. I cant remember the first time I came here, but it was some time ago after I moved out here. The convention center has an older part thats smaller, and a new addition thats huge!  Plenty of events are held here all year round, from sporting events like the NBA all star game, to the auto show, they had an NRA convention a couple years ago with a zillion people, along with other regular yearly events like the auto show and several others. The place is large, and has 3 levels (a basement area, main level and upper level) with a crosswalk to get to the other side which is pretty darn cool. Its huge, spacious, and modern looking with its updates.  Escalators, stairs, etc.  The place is sparsely decorated with Arizona stuff that makes it really cool looking. They also have a cool light feature outside that illuminates the walkway with different colors at night and is really pretty to look at as well. The cool thing about it is too is that its easily accessible via light rail, and you dont have to spend $$ on parking...and let me tell you, the parking here isnt cheap! $12 for the garage, $10 in lots around, and its not any cheaper the farther away you get.  I dont know why anyone would want to park down here, since the light rail is $3.50 round trip, so save yourself a few bucks and take the rail. Youll thank me later! Theres also food and dining in here as well, with a variety of different style resturants, but again, its outrageously expensive!  They have a starbucks here too, which is their regular prices, but is like an extra $5 a person to eat here, so dine elsewhere before you come in here.  (minus the coffee since Starbucks is the only reasonably priced place in here.)  Plus, the convention center is a hop, skip and a jump from about a zillion other cool dining places that your better off eating at anyways, so do that instead. Aside from that, this place is pretty huge, and its worth checking out. Plenty of clean pretty bathrooms and tons to do in and outside of the center with variety of different sized spaces to hold any kind of event, large or small."
1,"Glad this place has new ownership... I should probably remove the review below, Its really harsh and doesnt apply to the NEW establishment.  You have been warned ;)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Short Review: THIS PLACE SUCKS BALLS Long Review: We were supposed to meet a friend here at Draft House on Saturday night. We were excited to be out on a date-like experience cuz its been a while. We went to my in-laws for dinner and then headed to Draft... I knew it was going to be interesting from the sound of the music as we pulled into the strip mall.  The music: Good music, probably the only good thing about this place - if youre a hip-hop fan. All hip-hop, all night.  The crowd: Ghetto fab all the way! Seems like everyone there is late 20s - early 30s (and some older sprinkled throughout the crowd) and none realize its not 1996 anymore. Expect to hear a lot of fake accents a la Da Bronx and a lot of misuse of slang terms. It was entertaining until it became annoying. Oh and people WILL steal your seats or tell you they are saved - ugh! The atmosphere: small, crowded...  Small dance floor.  A couple pool tables, but dont expect to get one. Some TVs playing various sports, which I guess qualifies this place as a ""sports cafe""??  The service: OMG, we had one beer each and the ""line"" was retarded, over 30 minutes to tab out. No line in sight, just people crowding together, trying to get to the front of the line.  Oh! and LOL.. the bar tenders are total morons, one of them complained to the guy next to us about his crappy tip and the other argued with his customer about whether they ordered rum and cokes or redbull and vodka.  The guy had already made the rum and cokes and was pissed that HE got it wrong.  Weirdos! If any of this appeals to you this is your place!  BTW her friend didnt show and we ended up going to Skip n Jans to play some pool :o)  We had a great time there :o)"
2,"Strange just strange. I park here when I travel out of town. I used the valet parking once last year and dont remember any issues. Today was my second time... I dropped my car off last week. The airport shuttle was waiting for me at baggage claim when my flight landed at midnight. I went to pick up my car after a long flight as was told ""its at the front"", the valet guy pointed and disappeared. I was left standing alone wondering if there was another side of the hotel where my car was?? I walked into the lobby and the receptionist was quick to tell me there is a balance on my account. Huh?? Number one I dont have an account at the hotel and number two I didnt stay here overnight. Again Im standing there thinking what is going on, is he getting my mixed up with someone else? Finally he explained the parking wasnt prepaid and I needed to pay in a order to get my car. He gave me a bit of an attitude as if I was refusing to pay. Dude, its 12:30am, I just got off a long flight & didnt realize my fiancé didnt prepay online when he set the whole thing up for me online. All this confusion could have been spared if the valet guy would have just said ""you pay at the desk"" instead of ""its at the front"" which is unclear and indirect. I think next time I go out of town ill try a different parking garage."
3,"Tried Rock Bottom tonight before a movie and I thought it was ok. I had the Lemon Grilled Chicken with Mashed Potatoes and Asparagus.  Everything was very yumm, but Rock Bottom just didnt make enough of an impression on me. If I was obsessed with beer maybe it would have gone over better. Restaurant ambiance and menu were very typical and neither were impressive. However my crazy friend Megan ordered Buffalo Fajitas, yes real buffalo steak, so that was a cool menu option.  Now I can add Buffalo to the list of crazy things Ann Marie has eaten. p.s Buffalo tastes a lot like steak."
5,"Stephen G. hit the nail on the head - ""You buy a peaceful experience"". I was looking for a resort/spa but also wanted to take advantage of horseback riding as much as I could. This resort definitely exceeded my expectations - the staff is AMAZING (friendly, accommodating, etc), the food was delicious, the resort is beautiful and the rooms were also clean and well-maintained. Everyone I encountered went the extra mile with regard to service. I came back to NYC completely rejuvenated."
4,This place is great. The Pizzas are single serving or post salad and some of the best Pizza Ive ever had. Salads are good and and service is excellent.  Keep it Simple Stupid KISS
3,"The food is as good as the Coronado location but the ambiance is seriously lacking. The inside had a funky smell so we opted for 100 degree heat and ate outside instead. The main reason for three instead of four stars is that they screwed up our order. Not a huge offense, you say? Well they put their uber spicy jalepenos on my toddlers quesadilla instead of on my burrito. They replaced it but still...  Bottom line: their food is good- love the carne and pork. Well eat here again but Ill be double checking to make sure the order is right."
4,So happy Los Dos Molinos is in the east valley! Los Dos makes it spicy so come prepared to drink a lot of margaritas...not like thats a bad thing. Great food & great prices!
4,"I went here with my mom while my dad had a dinner meeting. The atmosphere is hip but its also got a mature setting. It is a really great place for young adults and even older ones. The price was good, the food was amazing! The portions were also big and MOST the staff was friendly. I overheard two rude staff members making fun of the customers. However they might not even work there anymore. Great place!"
4,"Everything is awesome at this place, and authentic according to my Japanese friend. I just love the fact that they have more than just sushi. Their fish with rice dish was amazing. Since Ive come to AZ, Ive never seen this dish at any Japanese restaurants around here. The staff is all Japanese, with somewhat limited English, so I guess you know youre at an authentic place."
4,Zipps is a rocking place with TV screens in all viewable angles. The atmosphere is great and this place really packs it in on game nights like Monday Night Football. Smoking is outside because this place is around the Tempe border. The service is great and the food is even better. Try the chicken tacos! Good times had by all! Check it out some time!
5,"Alas...Ive given up the idea of writing a review for a place if it isnt at least 4 stars. Sue me; Im in the industry.  Fuego Bistro is by far one of the best places Ive been to recently. I was introduced to it this last weekend on a date. Ironically, its super close to my house yet Ive never heard of it. When we were arriving, I was a little curious to see where the hell he was taking me since there arent any signs really and its pretty hidden. Once we were inside, though, it was like finding a little treasure. The patio is welcoming & even though we didnt have a reservation (aka we couldnt sit outside) we snagged a table close enough to enjoy the beautiful weather.  We started off with a round of mojitos and even though its been a few years since theyve won best mojito...I can say the Prickly Pear was the best Ive had in a while. The Ahi Tostadas followed & they were awesome...the sauce added a kick to it & it was a perfect start to the meal. After, we shared the Fuego Pasta with chorizo, chicken, mushrooms, peppers, & a chipotle cream sauce...huge! What I did eat of it was delicious. My favorite (and my dates Im fairly certain) was the special...an herb crusted Mahi Mahi with a pineapple sauce, home-made cornbread, & chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes. Amazing. Even though the Mahi Mahi might be hard to come by if you visit, the two sides arent & are so good, Im droolin just thinking about it. :) Dessert? Try the banana burrito. Heaven on the tongue! Kevin was an excellent server which just highlights the night. Its hard to have a great meal without great service but he provided just that. If youre in the area...check it out. If you arent...check it out. Im pretty sure you wont be disappointed."
5,"Easy 5 star fun at the Phoenix Zoo. Ive never seen critters so closeup before. At the Monkey Village, they dont even have cages. The giraffes came right up to us. I spent half my beer money on fishheads and shrimp feeding the stingrays. It was a blast! We had great time! yow, bill PS - Ive never commented on other peoples reviews before. But jeez. When someone goes to the zoo and complains about the cost of a hot dog or a snow cone... well, for spider monkeys sake, get a clue!"
1,"Lets just say i was not to please with my experience at Nails R Us. After two days my nails were lifting on about 4 nails by the end of the weekend i had 6 nails lifting, so i went back and showed them and she was like its normal. No it normal to lift but not after 2 days! They did fix them for me free of charge but were very rude to me!!! Will not be going back there or will not refer any of my friends there!"
5,"Love it, love it, love it! I have been eating at various Pita Jungles around the Valley since I moved to AZ over 6 years ago and I have yet to have anything that I didnt love. My favorites include the Black Bean Burger, Lentil Fetoosh Salad, all three hummus types, dolmas, and gazpacho, but everything is delicious, so you really cant go wrong! The Tempe location also has breakfast, which is amazing!  Each location is fairly small, so luch and dinner may require a short wait, but its worth it. The prices are fair and the portions are huge! Dont be afraid to split a dish with a loved one."
3,"My boyfriend, myself, and his 3 year old foster sister met up with his mom, dad, and 2 year old foster sister. We were all heading up to Prescott this past Saturday (1/30) to play in the snow. When we got there, they were already set up with drinks & pancake balls (strange, yet greasy & delicious). Theyd placed our orders as well since they texted us for them when we were still 15min or so behind them. The food was good. The service was just okay this time since I cant remember if anyone ever came to give refills on anyones drinks. I know they came by and asked if everything was okay a few times, but that was it. Still, friendly staff. The bathrooms werent anything spectacular, but its a bathroom...at a Dennys.  Anyways, we all left full and went on about our day."
4,"Neiman Marcus is a great addition to my shopping go-to locations like Nordstrom, and well, Nordstrom. I usually only shop at Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus, sometimes Saks. Anyway. Neiman Marcus has impecable customer service but know that you kind of need to ""dress up"" to shop here. At least I feel uncomfortable if I come in in yoga gear. The selection is a nice compliment to Nordstrom -- much more tailored and designer specific. My boyfriend loves their mens section.  I love their selection of Chanel handbags and other great purses. Plus, the layout of the store is just luxurious and calming. They dont carry MAC here but I love the Chanel, Christian Dior, and Laura Mercier counters.  My ONLY complaint is their hours. Ugh. They close at 7 Monday through Saturday and 5 on Sunday. Its an hour earlier than the rest Scottsdale Fashion Square so there have been many times where Ive trekked from Nordstrom to Neimans only to find they are closed.  If you dont want to go through the mall there is complimentary valet at Neimans. You can park in their private lot but its on a hill and narrow so if Im feeling rushed I just valet....but Im also not the best at parking. NOTE: the only credit card they accept is AMEX. Otherwise its cash or check. Thats right, no Visa, no Mastercard"
3,"Closed?  Really?  It seems this place just randomly shut down, after much less than a year of being open.  Only went there once - we enjoyed the food, the ambiance, and the beer.  We recommended it to others as well.  Showed up on a Tuesday night for dinner and everything was packed up....?  A little searching on the web (Facebook, specifically) shows that theyre done.  What a shame."
1,"I do not like this KFC ...or any really for that matter. Every time I have been here the place is filthy. I know they remolded the place and I have not been since then, so I am not sure if the conditions are the same. The food is just not good in any way anymore. Not that it was ever great, but you could get some decent chicken and some sides and be content. What the hell have they done to the mac & cheese? It is so gross..the color is just not appealing and the taste is worse. Food at this place has been served under temperature enough times to keep me from returning."
1,yuk! service and food sucked never a gain!
5,"I have been exploring more of the park recently.  I want to add that the National Trail (which is almost 15 miles long and goes from one end to the other) is a real gem.  The views on this trail are outstanding, and on the western half, you will find far fewer people than on the eastern half.  Highly recommended."
4,"I feel like an East Coast gangster when I roll up to LGO for breakfast. Ill take the Jersey Girl... pump fist and hair toss!! Hands down, its the BEST omelette Ive EVER had. And the fresh-squeezed OJ hits the spot.  After a hike at Camelback, its relaxing to come and sit on the patio... if you can find a spot. Weekends this place is a zoo!! During the week is pretty crazy but has its peaks.  The French Toast is pretty tasty and they do pastries just right. Muffins are baked fresh, toast is always spot on perfect. I want their toaster! Ive had the pizza, which is pretty decent but not the best Ive eaten. The salads are delish."
5,"I love Tasty Kabob!  Their food is always excellent, and I try to make it back there whenever I return to the Valley.  I always order their chicken shish kabob entree, which comes in a generous portion that includes rice and grilled vegetables.  The chicken is always tender, well-marinated, and equally well-seasoned.  Their beef shish kabob entree is also very good. Try shaking a little sumac spice onto the rice and meat for some extra flavor, or just enjoy it as is.  Its difficult to choose from their list of appetizers and side dishes, but their hummus is always creamy and smooth, and I love their shirazi salad.  Their spicy beans dish, however, is, by far, my personal favorite, and I always make sure to order it.  Just as important as the food is the friendly service I encounter whenever I visit.  The couple who own the restaurant always make you feel welcome.  Good food and service that makes you feel at home, what more can you ask for?  Simply put, Tasty Kabob is one of the best."
5,"Really great food and service, and it worked out just fine for my two kids, ages 7 and 10. (Meatball pizza was a hit for the younger one; the older one shared sausage pizza and mussels.) The food came very quickly. We had all small plates and pizza, not entrees: kale chips, fried chickpeas, peppers, mozzarella salad. Dessert was great. The mousse was first rate, and the parsnip creme brulée was delicious (though we couldnt taste any parsnip; it just tasted like excellent, flavorful creme brulée). One of the best meals we had in Arizona. And we also really liked the decor. Simple, elegant, and also fun/creative. Not sure why anyone would ding them for that. Also, the portion sizes were just fine. We all left full but not feeling gross. Were from MA, and were unaware of the chefs celebrity. I wonder if some of the griping here is just celebrity bashing, or a reaction against some sort of hype? Im outside that loop, but it just struck us as an excellent and fun place with great food and no pretension. Just thorough competence. Note: Its a nice walk from the Arizona Biltmore Hotel. Under 2 miles."
4,"Try the deep dish, the smallest size can easily feed 3-4 people, its SOOO think and yummy.  Great staff and food, what more can you ask for?"
4,"Best pizza Ive had in Arizona hands down. My best friend lives in AZ, my friends and I stopped by this place and enjoyed surprisingly wonderful tasting pizza a must try. When I went here they were playing underground hip-hop which I am a fan of. It made it a great atmosphere to enjoy my food. I highly recommend this place I live in California and this place still comes to mind. Great for college students and the fam bam."
3,Been closed for a long time.
4,"I stopped by early this morning to satisfy my crave for something new. The place is very clean and a man came out to greet me and was ready to serve. He clearly explained every item I was curious about since the labels were in Spanish. I asked if his name was Miguel and he said yes. I told him I read about his bakery on Yelp. Then he said that he loves Yelp and thats how word is going around now for him and he also uses to find reviews on other places. He was very friendly and had lots of patience. I was the only customer at the time and he actually doesnt mind having a conversation unlike open ended talks with others. I ended up buying 10 pastries and it cost $6.80. What a great deal! They also sell other items such as tamales, burritos, and menudo. I inquired about the burritos cuz I like mine with a little kick,but unfortunately they werent ready yet. He showed me the homemade tortillas and he says he used them on the burritos. He said they dont look big, but he assured that the burritos are filled with red (mild) or green (with a kick) chili, shredded pork, and some potatoes. He said that one burrito is good to fill up a person. So...I must come back and try it.  So far Ive had the flaky pastry with the shredded coconut and Bavarian cream...the Bavarian wasnt as creamy than Im used to. I almost thought it would have been better off to not have it, but its a nice added flavor when you eat it all together rather than just tasting the Bavarian on its on.  I had that curvy, pretty looking pastry which is topped with crystal sugars and with all the sugar on top, I thought it might be too sweet, but nope. It was just fine with the pineapple filling (excuse me as I wipe my drool).  Then it was off to have the caramel flautas dusted with powdered sugar. The first bite was eh. The second bite was...um. Third bite, WOW! I finally reached the part that had more caramel in it and I LOVE IT!!! Did I mention that Im not a big fan of caramel? This caramel is sweet and creamy. Its just so good! A definitely must have for next time. Thats about as much my tummy let me eat for today. Im sure the rest will be just as good and I cant wait till tomorrow morning to try to rest of my goodies."
4,"This Chilis isnt a lot different than the one on Mill.  However, not being on Mill does have its advantages with not being full of college kids all the time.  The service is pretty good and its crowded all that often.  You can have a quiet dinner here more than at the one on Mill.  Pretty good Chilis here."
2,Dont get Breonna as your server. Didnt ask if we wanted another drink after we decided to stick to appetizers. She didnt appear to know where the water was or remembered we were at one of her tables. Food was good as always.
2,"I love love love consignment stores...and walking in this store, the smell was great...  however... I have to say i am disappointed with My Sisters Closet. I had heard such great things, so I was really excited to go. They did have some amazing designer purses, including a $3400 jimmy chu purse that was huge and gorgeous for $1899.   The designer section clothing was hung on nice wooden hangers with their logo (Nice touch).  However....... The items I saw around the store, and my friend with me agreed, seemed like more than 40% really were more appropriate for a thrift store, and a lot of the items were really dirty (and still had high prices). You could see food stains on a dooney bag.. a coach wristlet, black, had white food smeared all over it... still highly priced for as dirty as it is. The thing is... even if it is a brand.. sometimes your store reputation is worth more than the 10 bucks youll make by selling something dirty. Just my .02.  I saw sensors put though jeans pockets, wallets (in the leather!) and other questionable placements. When I asked about it.. the sales person just said, well maybe there is someone new who does not put it in the right place. That damages items people are buying, and they may not realize the big holes placed by those sensors.  I loved there ""on the web"" tags. Ive never seen that before, but they are really pretty and catch your eye if you want to take a closer look.  I prefer consignment stores to identify the sizes on the hanger by color coding or some such to make it easier to find my sizes. I get bored really fast trying to find my size..  As a consumer, I would have spent more time looking had I been able to really scan the racks easier for size. The shoes are nicely organized.... and clearly labeled. They were not over crowded so it was easy to see the shoes.  There are some positives.. I purchased a le sportsac tiny bag for 9.99, it was new so i do feel it was a good deal.  but really be careful what you buy.. The prices for the purses seemed high for used resale and their obvious usage stains."
3,"No frills.  Nothing fancy.  Just some honest burritos and tacos.  Voted ""best taco"" by New Times a few years back (in the 90s).  Not sure I agree, but they consistently satisfy.  They make a hearty breakfast burrito too.  If youre looking for Sonoran or Tex-Mex or anything beyond what you might find at Filibertos, try somewhere else.  The red burro combo is my personal favorite.  Its saucy (enchilada style) and just spicy enough.  Bottled beer available."
5,great place to go and the pizza ia great too
5,"Awesome place!! EXCELLENT food/apps(try the bleu cheese figs)! Ask for Dizzy Dre, hes AWSOME and listens to your likes and customizes drinks for you!! Very patient with women!! ;)"
4,Yum! Steaks were great! Corn bread large portions definitely worth the price!
1,"IHOP is barely a step up from Dennys in terms of boring chain food. Last night was the first time I ever had dinner there, and it tasted like squishy, mushy cardboard. The food took forever even though there were only three tables in the place with customers. The reason I gave it two stars instead of you is because the breakfasts are pretty good. I dont mind them except the omlettes which are way too oily. The coffee is almost bad, but the waitresses always look happy. [update April 2, 2011] Whyd I go back? I hate this place now. We went today for the first time we have all had a chance to go out together for breakfast. I was excited to do this and was eager. I shouldve stayed home. My wife got a waffle with her combo that was cold, tasted like cardboard, and was crunchy. The bacon my wife and child ordered was burnt, crispy and did not look like bacon at all. My sausage (I always upgrade to turkey sausage since the regular pork kid here is vomit worth) was totally cold. I sent it back and complained. I think she microwaved my plate.  Their coffee is always burnt so I got an iced coffee. She said they had Mocha, Vanilla, or Hazelnut. I asked if they just had a regular coffee flavored one... she said yes, and brought me disgusting hazelnut (glad Im not allergic!!) Ok now its three hours later. My daughter laid on the floor whining about how bad her stomach hurts, Ive been to the bathroom twice and my wife is asleep because she said if she didnt lay down, she would puke. Seriously. The management (district managers) really need to care enough to read YELP.  They remodeled the outside of this place and, I guess, spent all their money to make it look pretty so wed forget they serve dogfood."
5,"This place was great. When one of my coworkers sent an email to our group who was visiting Phoenix saying he had gotten us a reservation at ""The BEST pizza in the country"" i Was skeptical. Best pizza in Phoenix? Well, I wasnt disappointed!  We had a group of 8., and we ordered almost one of everything on the menu: Apps: Antipasto - Wood Roasted Vegetables, Sopressata, Bite of Cheese Spiedini - Italian Fontina wrapped in Prosciutto di Parma, served warm  Pizza: MARGHERITA - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Basil  MARINARA - Tomato Sauce, Oregano, Garlic (No Cheese)  ROSA - Red Onion, Parmigiano Reggiano, Rosemary, AZ Pistachios  SONNY BOY - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Salami, Gaeta Olives  BIANCOVERDE - Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula  WISEGUY - Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage  Of all of them, the Biancoverde was my absolute favorite! I dont eat pork, so I couldnt sample them all, but Id happily order this one again. In fact, my team is returning next week for another team dinner for the coming Phoenix trip, and I will for sure be ordering this. Their house draft beer is also quite tasty! Tip - if you are a party of 6-10, get a reservation! They dont take reservations for smaller groups and Ive heard the wait time can be a few hours at the busiest times! But worth it!"
5,We Care Family Wellness Center is the most exceptional doctors office and staff that I have ever found. Every employee here genuinely cares about you. I highly recommend.
3,"meh...... Im torn. I found this store to be a little bit of a walking contradiction.(okay, not ""walking"" but you dig what Im saying)  Reminds me of myself in alot of ways....not all of which are good.   You see, I recycle EVERYTHING at work because the cute little receptacles are provided for me by waste management thus leading me to not actually think about what Im doing. Plus, I co-manage a 26 story high rise mid-town and with the whole ""green"" movement, wed be setting ourselves up for some major problems if we didnt comply with demand and of course, it does just ""make sense"".     At home, not so much and to be blunt I dont really think twice about it. (go on.....hate)  This is how I feel about Fresh & Easy. Hybrid parking (fkn ridiculous) but no bike rack?? WTF??.....  Tons of bullshit organic produce and no preservatives  but then everything has been super sealed in some weird plastic containers. The F&E brand crapola that I tried was mediocre at best,  also,  it seemed like everything I picked up was within a day of expiration.  I dont know about you F&E. We could be kindred sprits.... but two wrongs dont always make a right."
2,I stopped in for a quick lunch and I wasnt impressed at all.  I heard that the food was good but Ive had better subs almost anywhere.  They have very limited toppings.  I wish I had gone to Mr. Goodcents down the street much better quality subs.
3,just another big store with everything everywhere.
3,"In my effort to live and love local, I try to show Bashas some love since they are a locally owned chain. Everything about this Bashas is just OK. The produce, inventory and service are all par but nothing stands out. I recently bought several baked goods from this Bashas for an event. I was on the hunt for sugar cookies that Santas little elves could decorate during a shopping crawl. They didnt have any out, so I asked the lady behind the counter. She told me they had cookies in the back for a dollar a piece. This was too high for my budget so I politely declined. Then a couple minutes later, she came back and told me they were actually on sale and only $.50, so I decided to buy them. Coincidence that I said no to cookies for a $1 and then they became 50 cents, or just oversight by the employee? Who knows....  During my visit, I also purchased some donuts. I need two dozen donuts and unfortunately they dont have donuts by the dozen pre-made so I ended up making my own. While this is good because you can choose your own, I think it would also be helpful to have pre-made dozens for those in a huge hurry (like I was that day).  In summary, this Bashas is just OK, but I love supporting local so I will continue to shop here!"
4,Was in Phoenix for a softball tournament this past weekend and stayed here cause it was one of the host hotels for the tournament.   Front desk staff were friendly and fast so check in was a breeze.  The room was great. Had 2 double beds in a separate room and a queen size pull out. Beds were comfortable and linens were above normal hotel quality. Bathroom was big...though it contained the closet which was kinda weird. Towels were over sized and very soft. Small balcony was nice.  Parking was in a structure next to the hotel and we never had a problem. Loved the atrium like interior of the hotel.  The only cons I can think of were ...the elevators were kinda slow. ...the toilet didnt flush right away and you had to hold the handle down a few seconds. ...and the hash browns at the breakfast buffet were extremely dry hahaha Over all this hotel is a very nice one to stay at and I would definitely stay here again if I am ever in Phoenix again.
5,"If youre at all a ""Foodie"" you cant come to Phoenix, or anywhere within 50 miles and not visit Matts Big Breakfast.  The wait outside is just part of the ambiance and culture of this tiny little place.  I hope they dont very enlarge this place....it would so spoil it. Food....have anything.  Its all cooked to perfection with love and kindness from a kitchen staff that really cares about freshness.  My personal favs are the Waffle and Bacon and the multi grain toast with the fresh jam typically made locally....changes frequently.  This was on Diner, Drive-ins and Dives a few years ago and its still the same bustling place as when Guy was there. Side note...this was way cool.  On our last visit there were 4 of us, and if youve been here you know there are only a couple of tables that seat 4.  So were waiting outside when the server comes out hands us menus, takes our orders.  When were seated about 15 min. later our food was delivered within minutes of being seated.  Helped us get in and out and helped them move a table.  Much appreciated service."
4,"modified is a great place to see a show.  it almost reminds me of basement shows back home- intimate, smelly, people utterly engrossed in the music, all ages.  its good stuff."
5,"I grew up in Arizona and we went to Wongs every Sunday after church.  Three years ago we got stationed in Hawaii.  Everytime I come home, our first stop is Wongs.  I love everything about it.  Wongs is my comfort food."
3,"Service here sucks.  Our ""waitress"" took forever to get our food, and then didnt bring utensils, plates or napkins.  I had to keep going up to the bar to get a drink.  Several times I waited too long.  One time I went up there and there was no one working there.  I should have just put on an apron and walked behind the bar myself and made my own drink.  Still, they have an awesome set up outside for enjoying the warm Phoenix nights.  I dont understand why the band has to play inside.  I guess people who live nearby complained about the noise.  Then dont live next to a f*cking bar!!! Idiots."
4,"I cant dance..yes I can!  Well tonight the hubby and I took our first dance lesson and what a hoot!  Had a blast.  The instructors approach was clear and easy to follow.  She did a great job at blending focus on the instruction with keeping it fun and upbeat.  The facility is pleasant, immaculate and huge - and available to students for practice at any time, not just during their lessons. As mentioned in a previous review, they have a great deal for first time students.  The best thing for couples is that the price per lesson is the same whether for a single or a couple.   Because Ive only done one lesson, and my first dance lesson every (well since high school, but the dinosaurs because extinct since then),  Im looking forward to more lessons and the opportunity to add a star."
4,"Their rolls are super inventive....and they stay open later than most Sushi Places in the Valley (2am).   Their Happy Hour is insane! Ex: 99 cent beers on Tuesday! Ive never had a disappointing meal here, and I am pretty hard to please when it comes to sushi. Recommendations: Signature Roll Squid Salad Yellowtail Collarbone Drinks, Drinks...drinks. They have a little karaoke room, and full bar you can make use of as well. 1 Thing: When its busy, be prepared to order everything at once...or you will be waiting."
1,"If you are over 24 you are too old to be here.   First, this place has beer.  Dont order mixed drinks, dont order wine, both are gross unless your sole purpose is to get trashed, which is the mission of every underage and young, young 20-something at this bar. This is the place youd go to with your fake ID because when youre 19 this is what you think a bar should be. Expect people over drinking and throwing up very early on in the evening in the bathroom."
4,Not your typical deli meat-this is the real deal with the shredded turkey.  Very good.
5,"Changing Hands is the perfect bookstore. These types of places just dont seem to exist, but Changing Hands has managed to survive. Allow me to begin by saying that this bookstore does not have anywhere near the selection of a Barnes and Noble (or probably a Borders, but I dont go into that garbage store and cannot be sure). With that said, there are a few reasons to shop here. First, and most importantly, they have well priced used books. I believe most of their used books are $7.50. They are also all in pristine condition. Now, $7.50 used isnt always that great for a paperback. You can do better online quite often. Whats notable, however, is that their hardcovers are typically $7.50 as well. This is a fantastic price and is hard to beat. Second, the location of CH is perfect. This is one of the best plazas out there. Wildflower, Trader Joes, Macs, Jamba Juice--you cant go wrong. Third, and finally, Changing Hands is a local store, and many good things come with that. The staff is extremely friendly. From what I can tell, they are all hardcore book nerds and you have to love that. The store also has a very welcoming feel to it. Once youre in, you will realize how extremely friendly everyone is. No, not just the staff--the customers. Everyone is talkative, friendly, and just seems to be happy. They are all indulging in one of their hobbies in one of the most inviting stores I have ever seen. Someone will ask the staff ""who wrote such and such?"". The staff will almost assuredly spot a regular and ask him or her  ""who wrote such and such"". If he doesnt know, someone else will  probably pipe up. Its this type of thing that makes it a great store. Overall, it just has a great atmosphere. The only negative comment I can make about Changing Hands is how hippy it is. Theres a ton of books on spiritual techniques, new age methods, buddhism, and whatever the hell else hippies/hipsters think makes them look more cultured. Of course, this just goes along with the Tempe, Trader Joes, and book reading demographic, so I cant blame them for meeting the inherent demand."
3,"The last three times I have been here, the hostesses have been so incredibly rude I have to update and ding them a star. The last time was the last straw and we just left turned around and left. Yes, you work at a popular property. That does not entitle you to be rude and nasty. Its weird as it seems to limited just to the front of the house. The waitstaff is usually great, food is great, and cocktails are top notch. Whoever is running this place, its time for a sit down with your girls in the front."
4,"Always drop by this place when im in tempe.  Usually i do not like greek/mediterranean food, but this place is the exception.  They give you pretty large servings of food when you order the dinners.  I always get the lamb and beef plate.  Comes with bread, meat, vegetables and some white cream sauce.  All in all an excellent combination.  Throw in the low prices and you got yourself a winner."
5,We loved this place.
5,We started each morning of our vacation at The Breakfast Club.  Everything was so tasty; juices are fresh-squeezed.  Menu has quite a variety and portions are very filling  It gets busy early.  Be sure to give it a try.
3,No bad for a chain.
4,"Oh.  Mah.  Gawd. Let me get this out of the way.. the ONLY reason Im dumping a star on Americas Taco Shop is because they charge extra for chips and salsa.  I HATE that.  Charge me if I ask for extra salsa or something, but otherwise, come on.   Now.  Said chips?  Perfect.  Salsa?  Perfecter.  My taco?  Made me cry a little bit.  I am picky about corn tortillas, but these were brilliant. Go to Americas Taco Shop.  I will see you there."
5,"These guys helped me out with my rear windshield wiper.  They could have just shrugged their shoulders and said they didnt have the part, but they worked with me and tried a couple of different options until we found a solution.  Everyone I encountered was great."
5,"Dr. Ken Danyluk and his team offer an Extraordinary Orthodontic experience.  Team Orthodonitcs offers many Orthodontic soluitions for all ages.  Whether patients choose traditional braces, Invisalign or ""Hidden Brace"" lingual braces behind their teeth, they always leave happy!"
3,"I stumbled upon this Fridays while walking around Phoenix on a Sunday afternoon.  I wanted to just go up and have a drink and then take some pictures of the empty baseball field.  Phoenix was completely empty! When I got closer to Chase Field there were some more people and I realized that there was a game going on!  I didnt think I would be able to get into Fridays because of the game; however, it wasnt very busy!  I sat at the bar since I was by myself.  But once I was there awhile, I noticed there were still tables open looking out into the ballpark.  So basically you get to watch the game for free as long as you are ordering stuff.  I thought that was pretty cool. As for the food/drink... I ordered a daiquiri when I sat down.  It was pretty bad.  Almost too slushy.  I looked through the menu and asked if they had any smaller portions or lunch portion.  I was told that since it was a game day they have a different menu and everything is larger.  So I didnt order any food. The service was good.  The waiter was nice and another waitress named Kimmy even came up and talked to me for a little while.  Id definitely come here again just for the view."
5,"Beautiful parish, also home to the amazing Legacy Ballroom that is available for wedding receptions and events.  The annual Middle East food festival is a wonderful family event with fantastic food, pastry, and entertainment!"
5,"Today our travels took us to the Chandler Mall on 10/31/2012. Therefore we were near to Abuelos for lunch. Nothing like returning to a Restaurant that you found to be very good! We arrived after 1PM, so we were seated ASAP. We ordered drinks first along with a serving of Guacamole. Nice way to start off lunch! My wife ordered the Dilla Lunch while I ordered the Grande Burrito Lunch special. Both item arrived on a very hot plate-wonderful! Whenever we are dining at another Restaurant, a hot plate is always expected but all too often the hot plate fails to appear. Our lunch stay hot until the last bite due to the hot plate service. Everything was great with the meal and no requested drink refills-always a sign of great service! Both restrooms were very clean and serviced many times during the day. We highly recommend Abuelos for a great lunch or dinner!"
5,"If I could give it more than 5, I would.  Sweet Pea and I live down the street, literally DOWN THE STREET, from this bar.  We waited for it to open for what seemed like decades, praying that this was going to be the type of place that could become our local.  It has exceeded our expectations.  The atmosphere is amazing.  The drinks are amazing- every last one of them- but the margaritas are the best Ive ever had.  They tasted like a fresh squeeze of sunshine that makes me happy inside.  Margarita Mondays- $4 margs AND free food?  Happy hours are amazing.  New Years Eve last year was amazing.  The 1 year anniversary party was amazing.  But most of all, the owner and staff are some of the coolest peeps that youll ever meet.  Go here.  You will love it."
5,"Thank you Sunflower for having a decent selection of tofu and fake meats so I dont have to drive 25 minutes to Whole Foods. Also I would like to tell you that I really enjoy your produce prices and your friendly staff, especially the cashiers, they are always so pleasant and helpful. While I am at it I should probably apologize for ""sampling"" lots of your candy from the bulk item bins, those chocolate covered peanut butter filled pretzels are amazing, I promise I always use the scoop. And one more thing, its really awesome that you carry beers brewed by Rinkukiu Alaus Darykla, the Lobster Lover is DELICIOUS!"
5,"Consistent with the east coast stores, great flavor selection, friendly and accommodating staff.   The regular size doesnt look big but it is plenty for the price, not to mention the staff consistently fills above the top the cup on all products.   A much better value than Cold Stone, Baskin Robbins, and self serve froyo."
4,"Sadly received this email today: Sabatinos is Closed You know we have been experiencing a lack of sales which we can blame on the economy, new restaurants opening here in the valley (most likely for much less cost than us original places), we tried to work with our landlord, but he would not budge on lowering our rent. We just could not afford the 5500.00 this month and were afraid we would lose everything in our place to a Lockout, which was threatened to us already. We just wanted to say goodbye to all of our loyal customers, we really enjoyed having you come in weekly and keeping up with your lives as well as you keeping up with ours. We will probably be leaving the Az area and starting over fresh.   God Bless   Kevin and Sheri"
4,"Sweet Potato Tater Tots..................why are you still reading?  what more needs to be said?  Yum Yum getcha some! The only thing keeping them from 5 stars is their unwillingness to enforce rules with parents who bring kids and think everybody else wants to enjoy watching them run around the place like its a playground, its NOT - keep your kids at the table or at home."
5,"OK, being from Wisconsin (the land of the ""great lakes"") I was COMPLETELY surprised to be told that, yes, there are lakes here in the desert of Arizona.  The Lake, Saguaro Lake, is a man made lake originally built as Stewart Mountain Dam...even so, its beauty is equal to those you would see in the glacier regions of the Midwest.  I was amazed, frankly, at how beautiful this tour was.  Sold for $18 for 90 minutes, you get your moneys worth.  But that is probably not what you want to hear... The ""event"" is a combination of 1) the scenery, and also 2) the charm of the paddle boat itself.  The boat is quite large with seating for probably close to 75 people!  Its an event that you could share with family, but I happened to be there with friends.  Currently, its a pretty mellow type of event (great for Mothers Day!), although I am told that they are hoping to exploit its benefits to include comedy shows, Jazz ensembles, stargazing, and a variety of other events. P.S.  They also advertise that you can rent the paddle boat for company picnics, weddings, and the like."
4,"There are bunch of different tours. I went on the hour long one (probably the cheapest one as well) where I didnt see the bedrooms or inside of the house. It was very hot coming here on a summer day - I do NOT recommend it. They do provide you with water and a red umbrella though.  I learned a lot about architecture from the tour and why certain things were done. I would recommend coming here during the fall seasons because they mentioned you can see the tents out there.  So quick summary - basically, Frank Lloyd Wright would live at this place during the winter months when it was warm in Arizona but super cold where hes from. He didnt come here during the summer months - way too hot!"
4,"Im rating this place as a Music Venue and Bar, not as a restaurant.  UBs seems to be hosting a slew of Metal shows over the next 3 months, which is good to see a place open its arms and bar to the metal community.  As far a heavy metal venue goes, its run of the mill. It has enough room to either mosh or sit in the booths along the back wall.  As far as the bar, the prices seemed slightly on the high side, especially for the ""dive-ness"" this place exhibits.  Their beer menu had 4 or 5 typos on it, just something to chuckle at, such as Rolling Rook beer, ODools, and listed Fat Tire as an import. (Cuz Colorado is SO FAR way).  Luckily, beer and metal go together, so people tend to pay.  The old man in the Bolo tie checking IDs was definitely a good sport."
3,"Good vibe - and outstanding location - they definitely work well with a large group (10), delivering orders to the right person without asking ""who gets ...""  LOVE THAT KIND OF SERVICE.  And not once, NOT ONCE, did the service people call any of our group ""guys"" (okay, okay, a pet peeve of mine).  Horseradish potatoes are a bit salty -- and prime rib serving is definitely less than generous.  That said -- the fish and chips were great, as were (according to one of our party) the pork and beans.  Desserts are HUGE -- share with 2 or 3 others."
4,"My husbands former employer said when we get to Phoenix we must go to In-N-Out. He said the last time he had one there was a line out the door. Not much of a beef burger person, we stumbled upon this burger joint as we left Ikea and decided to try it. The emergency granola bar I keep in my purse wasnt working. There was no line out the door, who wants to wait in line anyway. We both ordered a cheeseburger (no tomato, no special sauce, no ketchup for me). It arrived in a card board container which was kinda cute and everything was hot and fresh. My burger has a thick slice of onion and several crispy lettuce leaves. The burger itself was just okay, but the freshness of the toppings won me over. My husbands had a big slice of tomato.  Did In-N-Out live up to the hype from his former employer? Not exactly, but it came pretty close."
4,"I have just relocated to Scottsdale and eager to find a great wine bar and/or restaurant with a great wine list...and 5th and Wine was the one place that everyone recommended, so I was eager to check it out! I decided to check it out one night after work, and asked a few co-workers for some delish food choices to try...the bruschetta was the one to try! I loved the ambiance, very social atmosphere, nice bar scene and small tables, but they also had another room for tables further away from the bar which was more chill and quiet atmosphere.  I was quickly seated at a nice table in the more quiet area, and could scope out the scene.  I started with a delish glass of Charles LaFitte - Brut France sparking...which for $9 was a deal and refreshing! I quickly scanned the menu for the bruschetta and my mouth started to water with the selections.  I opted for the prosciutto/fig/marscapone bruschetta and the standard mozzarella/tomato/basil bruschetta!  Both were totally delicious!  The bread was lightly toasted and a bit soft...not like your typical ""crunchy"" bread bruschetta...which I actually enjoyed more than I thought I would.   I ordered the Beef Bourguignon Julia Childs ""Beef, Wine, Bacon, Mushroom Stew"" over egg noodles...for $16.96...again, a total deal and totally tasty!  The beef melted in my mouth and the mushroom and sauce was hearty and flavorful! All in all, the meal was wonderful, and the service was great - very attentive staff - Jonathan, my waiter, was super personable. I also met Scott Yanni, one of the owners, who came over to see how my meal was...and he was very gracious when I told him that I just relocated here and was very happy to find his restaurant as one of my new favorites! I will definitely be back for more of their great menu and tasty libations!"
4,"This is about a 3.5 star mexican place to me. Ive always had good service but watched other folks get like 1-star service, at a level I might not come back. I like the White Chimichanga here. The Chili Verde is decent, and the Hatch Chilis are nice too, if you havent had those. 4 Stars - White Chimi 3 Stars - Chili Verde 3 Stars - Cheese crips with Hatch chilis Im sure there are better places around but Ive been coming here for several years when in the area, and I definitely enjoy this place. Sometimes they have hot chicks working up front. If you keep up this practice Arriba, Ill five-star you sometime soon!"
3,Pizza crust & toppings are excellent. However the pizza sauce was too salty. Im willing to try again later.
3,"I dont drink, so my review will not be intoxicated by anything except the building.  I gave it two stars for the building.  They did a beautiful job with the remodel (Im a mid-century and Haver fan.)  The food wasnt anything to write home about.  I have to admit that Im particularly tough on restaurants filled with...I dont know what to call them...scenesters, I guess.  Service was ok.  Its not BAD, mind you, its just that I dont get it.  I guess if youre paying with credit cards all the time, you dont care how much mediocre food costs, as long as it makes you feel cool about eating there."
3,I thought this bagel shop was ok. The bagel sandwich I got was relatively lackluster. I think I will stick to Einsteins for the time being.
4,"I met up with a friend for dinner here the other night. Its a little far from me, unfortunately; if this was within a few miles of me, Id be here a -lot-.   For starters, the place is easy to miss. Its a hole in the wall. Its very small inside, only a few tables; definitely consider takeout.    That said, if its not busy, dont be afraid to stay. We ate in; when there was a significant lull in the crowd, the girl behind the counter came both to clear our tables and to deliver a second item I ordered a bit later in the evening. I wish Id been carrying cash, there is a tip jar by the register, and I would have loved to have left something for that.    The food...ah, the food. Great bang for the buck. Have I had better tacos? Yes. Once, handmade by a Mexican immigrant my mother was good friends with, as we joined her for a family dinner. In restaurants? No. This is good Mexican street food, small hand made corn tortillas with flavorful, moist meat on them, and some warm salsa on top. Lovely. They even offer lengua, for those that like it, a very nice touch.    As others have said, the rice is very good; I wasnt actually that fond of the beans though.    Is this place worth going 20 minutes out of your way? Unfortunately, no, hence the 4 star. But is it worth going to if youre already nearby? Yes, very much yes."
1,"I give this review a total 1 star If I was able to, I would have rated no stars at all!.... I would NEVER reccomend ANYONE to live here. The office staff is horrible and made me feel uncomfortable the whole year I lived there based on THEIR MISTAKES! I can not express how disappointed I am with the way that they have treated me....."
5,"Dr Brodkin is one of the greatest doctor out there.  She was voted two years in a row for arizona foothill top doctor and it shows!!!  She is caring, and overall great doctor.  She moved her office last year and wow did she change for the best.  The staff is great her new nurses i love love love....i recommend Dr Brodkin to anyone who need  a GYN...."
5,"My wife and I as well as several of our friends drive from Ahwatukee on a regular basis to dine at Flos on Thompson Peak and Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd. 25 miles isnt too far for this food. Weve been eating here since the 90s and have always been pleased. I discovered it when I worked in the area and used to stand in line for lunch, it was so busy. Our favorites: Lemon Pepper Chicken with extra lemon wedges and the Kung Pow although I cant think of anything I wouldnt order."
5,Great place.  Hard to see behind Carls Jr. on Southern Ave but is Worth finding!
3,"Yelper Jane Bs review is remarkably similar to what I intended to include in my review. Weve stayed at close to a dozen different Homewood Suites over the years and this one left us wishing we could have stayed at any of the others instead. Furnishings were adequate but not terribly comfortable.  The living room had a sleeper sofa and a side chair, a dining table with two chairs, an end table, a coffee table, and a TV stand with 3 drawers plus the kitchenette, all in a room roughly 9 x 14. The bedroom contained a desk with 3 drawers (serving also as the dresser) and the bed and nightstands.  The desk also served as the TV stand, allowing a small work area and taking up so much room the door couldnt swing all the way open. Our bedroom also contained the mystery deadbolted closet with unknown contents, which took up half the guest closet space. The bathroom was large but dingy and dimly lit. I considered renting an on-demand movie one evening, but everything offered by the hotel was $15+/each (!!) and since there wasnt a DVD player we didnt have the opportunity to rent somewhere more reasonable and bring it back to our room.  Free wifi seemed stable although a bit slow, and the pool was small but the kids didnt seem to mind. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was well-prepared and always had enough variety to keep the kids and adults happy. We got a great rate but hey, its Scottsdale in the summer so most rates are pretty darn good.  Normally we enjoy staying away from home, but after 6 nights here even the kids were anxious to get home. Well stay at Homewood Suites again in the future, but not this one."
3,Another place thats walking distance. Subway is one of those places where you cant go wrong....you got 5-dollar value meals or foot longs. The guys are really friendly and arent stingy with the toppings. Im not a big fan of the smell subways have though. Eh anyways its just one of those places where im lazy and dont want to make a sandwich...plus it helps me keep my girlish figure like jared :)
5,"Really good food, fun atmosphere, great experience and totally unique and fun.  I would way rather spend my money at a one of a kind, family owned shop than a cheaper- dime a dozen corporate mcdonalds."
3,"Mulligans is that place in Scottsdale you dont think of going to when youre in the mood for dancing, which is mostly why I go out in Scottsdale at night. But I always find myself there either before or after my dance trips. I totally dig the atmosphere at Mulligans - its chill, unpretentious, and never obnoxiously crowded. The prices are decent and the location is pretty centralized.  The DJ isnt always the best, but when youre with good friends and good drinks, Mulligans makes you feel at home.  Mulligans kind of has that dive bar feel but doesnt make you feel like you might get mugged and stabbed in the eye."
5,"Loooove this place! Yes its pricey, but good sushi usually is. The guys making the rolls were friendly. The atmosphere is nice. Hubby absolutely loved the quail eggs and I couldnt get enough of the spicy shrimp roll. Seriously, try it. You wont be disappointed!"
5,"This, my friends, is THE place to get some very authentic Chinese food.  The servings are HUGE for what youre paying...shucks, they are huge no matter which way you look at it so be careful not to order too much food unless you want leftovers. Who doesnt like leftover Chinese food anyway? My recommendations are the Sweet and Sour chicken, the Egg Foo Yung and the chow mein. You will not be disappointed. Youll also find the soups on the back of the menu at an average of 4 bucks or so. You will be pleasantly surprised when you get the bowl...it can feed at least 6 people. She will bring small bowls out and serve it for you right at the table. Give the hot and sour soup a try. As for the service, it depends on how you look at it. Dont be afraid to get up and refill your own water. Shoot, the waitress is the only one thats there, give her a break already. She must own the joint with her husband because there is always this little kid in the corner playing on his laptop. So, get your own water and your own take home containers if you want. She doesnt have a problem with it. Yes, the place is a little worn but you dont go there to look at pretty stuff. Its not dirty, just broke down. Youd be broke down too if you practically gave away your food in abundance to your customers. Who has money for new furniture if you take care of your customers bellies.  The lobster, crab and fish are fresh and cheap. Try finding lobster somewhere else in the valley for 10 bucks a pound, I dare ya.  So, head on out, just dont go on a Wednesday, thats their day off. They are open 11AM to 11PM every other day though. You can call in your order and pick it up if you dont want to look at the place. Oh yeah, and if you ever go in there and it smells horrid, its not the place, its a popular dish that some customers order called ""Salty Fish"". It stinks to all heck! If that plate comes out I usually pack up my food, giggle and finish my meal at home. I dont mind one bit, thats just the way it is. Oh and the waitress does speak good English, however, you wont find many Caucasians frequenting this place. That means the food is pretty authentic!"
5,"Edens Grill has to be one of my favorite, and newly discovered Middle Eastern/Mediterranean restaurant in the PHX metro. Located in a sleepy strip mall, close to Arties Ace, is EG. My partner and I had the opportunity to have dinner here a few weeks ago and we were totally wowed by everything! We started off with the hummus, followed by two orders of the vegetarian plate. The vegetarian plates were huge and featured dolmades, falafel, rice, veggie skewers and veggie patties (2). The vegetarian plate was massive and everything on the plate was delicious. Next time well pay the extra $5 and split one Vegetarian Plate instead of getting two. The pita and hummus were fresh and delicious, however, I find EGs hummus to be a a little thick for my preference and they use a heavy dose of tahini in their hummus. Overall, I would totally recommend EG to anyone with an itch for Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food but be warned, they arent open for lunch on the weekends yet."
3,"Not bad, I usually leave pretty happy and full."
5,"Wow! Being a Phoenix native, we have enjoyed many a meals at the hands of Chef Gross. But this past weekend I was blown away. I was planning a large garden party for my friends bridal shower. The record temperatures left my garden ravaged by the heat and I did not want to have sweltering ladies unable to enjoy themselves. After a small response to attendance, I decided to see what some of my favorite dining spots could offer me. I had a small budget but wanted to keep it classy. Christophers truly rose to the occasion. Alex, was my special event contact and this lady was ""on it"". Emails and phone calls were returned at lightning speed. She presented a delightful menu with plenty of choices (some even for the vegetarians attending) all with in my price range.  We had a wonderful time. We had a party of 18 in the beautiful private room that fit our festivities perfectly. Sundays can be quiet at The Biltmore Fashion Park so it lend-ed us to a bit of intimacy that was nice. Ben was our go to guy. He was right there for every thing we needed and his helpers were polite and attentive. As for the food, well, its Chris, come on! I had the vegetable risotto ans  it was cooked to perfection. All of the plates came out of the kitchen quickly and all together but no one ever made us feel rushed. Wine flowed, desserts were gobbled up and the ladies oohed and awed over everything. the staff even offered to take gifts to the car for the bride. Thanks for saving me Chef Chris and your team. You were all fabulous and I will be telling all of my friends what a great job you did. The holidays are coming and Ben reminded us that they also do catering! Hmmm, can you say ""Christmas Party""?"
4,"Im not sure how Ive missed trying this place, after over a decade of living in the Valley, partly as an ASU student in need of a good hang-over recovery joint. I cant believe I relied exclusively on the IHOP on Apache Blvd, all those years in Tempe. Dammit! It was packed on the New Years Day morning I came here with a friend. The service was a bit slow but on par with my expectations for a jam-packed popular breakfast joint on New Years Day. I ordered a calorie-laden Cajun skillet with scrambled eggs. Im knocking off a star because the chicken pieces were too dry for my taste. But the rest of the skillet was very good. The service was friendly and professional. Wildcats beware, lots of ASU students within."
5,"By far the best poker room in the state and I have played in every casino poker room in the valley. The action is always there-lots of dead money to be picked up if you know where to look. Good promotions, amazing food served table side and all the sports games you can watch. I wish they would bring back 6-12 limit but 8-16 will have to do =) such an improvement over the tents, though they will always hold a place in my heart. It sucks cause I work right next to the casino and every night after work I have a tough decision..go home to my family or go to my favorite card room and tear it up. If you havent been there-MUST GO."
4,Outside atmosphere was really nice. This was my first time there and I enjoyed it. Our food was great. I had a salad and my friend had the filet which looked excellent. It was more pricey than I expected though.
5,"Doc and Edwards has been a place of refuge for 5 years for me.  Hell, most of my friends spent their 21st birthday there.  It is hard to explain walking into a bar and just feeling at home.  It is so comfortable and wide open.  Even on the most crowded days, I feel like I am on the cast of cheers.  The employees there are good and the food is exactly what you expect.  You can also order silvermine there with no delivery charge!  The pool table rates have gone up in the last few years but if you spend a good amount of money on drinks, they waive the pool table fee. Or you could go for some ping pong, foosball, UFC, or big buck hunting.  It has a great juke box but watch out for the lady that throws 20 in and slangs the worst playlist I have ever heard. If my girl would only let me, I would have my wedding there."
4,"This place is still really new, so theyre still getting the kinks worked out, but it looks great and the film selection is awesome!   I went there the Sunday of their opening weekend to see Metropolis.  It might be a little confusing the first time you go, but you pay for your movie tickets at the bar.  They dont have paper tickets yet, they just gave me and my date little stickers. The theater has 4 or 5 rows of comfy seats and a few tables in the back for people with drinks.  Metropolis was in Blu-Ray and looked amazing.  The showing went off without a hitch.  They even gave us a free bowl of tasty snack mix to eat during the movie.  Im not a drinker so I cant comment on the bar offerings, but I think its great to have a theatre showing rad independent and classic movies downtown.  I really hope this place takes off, I can see myself visiting it often."
3,"3.5 stars! I must say, Im a total fan of their Zipps Golden Wings! Gotta love their reverse happy hour! Ordering their wings on medium is smart move, their wings are already so flavorful and sweet, that its a shame to go any hotter, since youll mask the inherent, crisp, and juicy flavor. Id say pass on the Fish Tacos, and if youre in a burger move, order the Jalapeno Burger. Sampled their beer, not bad!  Breakdown: Zipps Golden Wings ~ a MUST get! Fish Tacos ~ Yawn... Sweet Potato Chips ~ Could do again! Jalapeno Burger ~ Delish!  Overall, this is a chill spot with your better than average bar food!"
4,"My previous review has the real details about what i LOVE about their food! Update:  Doing mostly take-out here, but at least one of the grumpy girls is more friendly now!  Yesterday when I grabbed our to-go order, she smiled, made small conversation, and did not exude a sullen disposition in any way.  Im happy for me, Im happy for her! Ordered many of our usual items, plus Mongolian beef, which was very tasty. Im stil partial to the Ginger beef, however."
5,"Mostly I love the Rokerij just because I love saying the name.   But the food is also killer.  I had the most amazing chicken, and the sides, which usually I just take for granted as filler food, were sodelicious that they caught my attention in a big way.  I also tried my dates steak, and while it was fairly spendy, it sure seemed worth it. The feel of the place is great too, with the dark stone walls and coziness without feeling too crowded.  We ventured downstairs to look at the bar, and had we been there early enough to snag a couch I wouldnt have wanted to leave. It definitely feels like a splurge, or somewhere youd take a business associate or date that you wanted to wow.  Its manages a high end feel, while remaining unmistakably local.  I cant say Id suggest it just for any old night, but it will stay on top of my list for special occasions."
2,"I really liked Joes; the food and service was always good. But one bad experience has me wondering if I will ever return. The problem I had was with the service. We walked in on a weekday around 11, the place was pretty packed and there was only one server on the floor. We grabbed a table and waited about 10 minutes before she came over with water. We told her were ready to order, to which she replied ""I am really busy and have other people who need to order ahead of you."" In my 16 years as a chef, I have never heard a server say that. She didnt even offer to bring us coffee or anything. If anyone from Joes is reading this, heres a little crash course in restaurant 101...if a customer says theyre ready to order, TAKE THEIR DAMN ORDER! Anyway, we ended up walking out. Guess well be eating exclusively at Matts Big Breakfast from now on."
4,"My review is based on Terminal 3, Delta!  Getting checked in at Delta was quick, security line was quick, and returning picking up my bags was quick too!  The signs are easy to read and easy to understand.  I was in Nassau, Bahamas airport, the signs pointed everywhere!  Crazy!!"
4,"Perfect for a Quick lunch. And I mean seriously quick. Like ninja light speed fast.  Under two minutes consistently from order to table. How can you beat that! One time they clock-in at 1min 45sec for a table of five.  My favorites are the House Special Chicken, the Orange chicken and the Prawns. cant go wrong and you will leave stuffed and satisfied."
5,I really enjoyed my mani/pedi with Trisha!  She took her time and taught me about manicuring my nails from home which I loved. I went in for the Groupon basic mani/pedi deal and left feeling like I got a lot more! It was the most pleasant experience Ive had at a nail salon. The conversation was easy and Trish is a great person. I will be coming back to Trish for nails again!  The entire staff was friendly and professional. Great Salon!!
4,"Fantastic, order anything off the menu and you will be pleasantly surprised.  Best gyro Ive ever had hands down and the falafel is equally amazing.  Owner paid special attention to my boyfriend and I and made sure we were happy with everything.  Only downside is that they close for a couple hours during the day before dinner time (I believe its 2:30 to 5:30 or something like that) so I cant eat their delicious food whenever I want, haha, keep on doing what youre doing Sahara."
4,"Time flies when youre having fun... Its been almost a full year since my initial review of Bacon, and Ive been back probably ten times or more. Ive seen a lot of transition with the employees but I can say that their service has gotten much better since the beginning.  The casual atmosphere is right up my alley for a weekend breakfast, and my yogi omelette / protein pancake orders have stayed consistent too.   I was there earlier today and while the service was spot-on, I did find a piece of ham in my otherwise veggie omelette - but I overlooked it and enjoyed my meal nonetheless... My husband has been to Bacon even more than i have, and he told me he recently sampled whats to come on their new lunch menu (think pastrami sandwich).  So, go for breakfast, go for lunch, go for a Bloody Mary or a Mimosa... just kick back and enjoy your meal!"
2,"Let me start by saying I have never had BBQ I didnt like. Ive had BBQ I could do without, but never that I didnt like. Went in for lunch today and I was the only customer, so I figured cool I will get good service no matter what. The girl sat me and was very pleasant and indicated my waitress would be right over. About ten minutes later, watching the waitress talk on a personal phone call at the bar the whole time, the girl who sat me came over to take the order. She walked up, didnt say a word, and just stared at me. Ok I can live with that it was only a minor inconviencence.  Got the #4 lunch chopped pork sandwich with beans and a lemonade and it came out very quickly. Possibly because the beans were Bushs or the like? They tasted like canned baked beans heated up in a microwave. Not cool. The sandwich was ok at best. Thinking back on Stacys, Honey Bears, and other great BBQ spots, this one was not even in the same arena. Ill have to go back though and try a sandwich with the correct sauce on it. There was one sauce on the table which after reading reviews here I had assumed was the BBQ sauce. It looked a little watery but I thought whatever its NC style, and it may have been because it was a bit vinegary. On the way out I noticed every other table had a red sauce labeled BBQ, so I guess they have two different ones. I would have preferred the red one I assume.  There was no atmosphere, the place was run down (doesnt appear to have been remodeled after Shish Kabob House vacated) and was generally a dirty feeling place. Seeing as they didnt have any customers at lunch time, Im assuming the place is going to lose money today. Dont know about other days, but they better get their act together quick or it is going to fail."
5,"Total wine totally takes a crap on Bev Mo. This store has everything! The employees are also very knowledgeable. The other day we went in and my husband insisted I try red wine instead of sticking to my usual Riesling (I dont like change). So we asked one of the employees and he asked me a few questions then suggested a bottle of Malbec. The Malbec tasted amazing! I was so happy. For those of you who dont know, its not only wine! You can find everything else. Total wine has helped us stock our bar and entertain our guests. Also, dont forget to chill your bottles before you leave!"
4,I love this place.Their italian beef with hot peppers is a must. I have also tried their sausage and pep sandwich which is just as good.Their prices are as good as you can get. So if youre hungry stop in & get full!!
2,This Baja Fresh really didnt impress me.  Its pricey considering that all youre getting is meat in a tortilla.  It doesnt have that Mexican feel to it and is unoriginal.  There were bugs on the wall.  The food is good however.  Nothing special though.  Since its a corporate chain you cant expect sizzling flavor but I was left unsatisfied.  There are better Mexican food places to go to.
4,"This is a standard place to celebrate Birthdays. The drinks are delicious especially the kiwi and acai specialty drinks. The rolls are over $10, but they are unique and tasty. The environment is very cool and the location is great. Parking is bad just like everywhere in Scottsdale, you need to park in the street. Location is great because you can grab dinner here and then go out after. There is also karaoke available if you want to rent a room for a special occasion."
3,"Moved here from San Francisco, and have been searching  for decent Chinese food.  Flos has been our standby, but we tried Jade Palace on recommendations of our midwestern snowbird friends. I can only comment on the food, as we ordered take out.  Our order was ready in 15 minutes and it was complete.   I had Chow Fun, and it was the equivalent to Flos, Ok, but not spectacular, and a lot more oily.  Husband had Mongolian Beef and said that Flos was better, but the meat tasted fresher on the Jade Palace version.  Jade Palace is much closer to us, so I will try their Hot and Sour soup in the fall, which is usually the barometer I use to measure Chinese Food.  Go figure, we are now hoping for some San Francisco restaurants to relocate to Scottsdale."
2,"Still not in love with it. Again with the overstaffing and employees huddled, eating/drinking and chatting instead of hurrying up and making my drink.  it is okay to hurry--or is that just my strange, city-thinking? meh."
1,"This place used to be amazing.  My favorite memories of past years is going to this seafood place with my parents.  Its not the same anymore. We went for my wifes 30th birthday.  My dad decided to join us.  My wife ordered steak and shrimp, my dad ordered steak, I ordered a crab stuffed lobster.  I have had the crab stuffed lobster many times before.  I was craving it. We got our appetizers.  Dad got snails, wife and I shared steamers.  My dad was happy with the snails.  But then again, how can you go wrong with snails doused in garlic and butter?  The steamers were steamed little neck clams in a garlic broth.  It was not long neck clams like the rest of the world calls steamers.  I wasnt about to argue with the server that these are the wrong clams. The food came and for the first time in my life I was asking the server to take back my meal before I even tried it.  It looked dry and over cooked.  I told the server Ive had this dish many times before and this is not the way its supposed to be.  He told me this is what its supposed to look like and begged me to try it.  I took one bite and I couldnt even swallow it because it was so dry.  Of course the server was gone by this point and didnt come back for 10 minutes to ask me how it was. While I was waiting for the server to return, I told my family I was just going to get the steak.  They just shook their head and told me not to.  I took one bite of my dads steak and spat it out.  How do you screw up steak this bad?  It tasted like beef jerky and butter.  My dad and wife would have complained too, but its my wifes birthday and I am already stealing her thunder.  I swapped my meal out for a steamed lobster.  How do you screw up a steamed 1 1/2 lobster?  Fortunately, that came out fine. So we left hungry and $300 poorer.  I used to not mind paying the money they charged but now, it is not worth it.  I am really hoping people stop coming here so they can just close down."
4,"Ive never been to the former restaurant that was once housed in this quaint little building, so my first impressions may be a bit different from others.  I have always adored this house.  Its absolutely adorable and in such a good location.  I read over the weekend that the new restaurant here was opening, so we made a point to visit it sooner rather than later. We chose to go right after work, so there were only a few other people in here.  I really like the setup with the bar in its own little alcove and seating situated throughout the rest of the house.  We were greeted immediately after walking in and we sat in a table by the window.  While we perused the menus I couldnt help but tap my feet to the killer old school music they were rockin.  I ended up deciding on the grilled cheese to eat. The food was very good.  The sourdough bread was super toasty, literally grilled to perfection.  There was a ton of cheese in the sandwich, but I dont remember which kinds.  The important thing is that it was really tasty.  My only complaint is that the cheese wasnt ooey gooey.  it was melty, but I could still make out the shape of the cheese.  In my book of grilled cheese greatness, it needs to be a little messier.  The sandwich was also served with a side of chips or salad if you choose.  The chips were good and I ate them all up.  There was also a dill pickle, but I dont do dill pickles. I definitely think that this is a killer new spot that will do very well.  I have no doubt that this ultra-hip but non-pretentious spot will quickly become a neighborhood favorite."
5,"This place is so unique! I was disappointed that it was closed the weekend of my birthday in July, but I wont hold that against them! This bar/boxing ring/vintage store/food truck/soda fountain is super awesome! My cousin took me here a few years ago and since then its been a place that I always show friends and family members when they want to go out downtown. The drink list is pretty extensive, with lots of organic cocktails served in cute mason jars. You definitely get a good sized drink! The beers are cheap, the food is so-so. I think its a bit overpriced, so Id recommend eating somewhere else beforehand.  The boxing ring is random, but Ive seen friends go up there and fight in a drunken stupor, and that is a sight Ill never regret seeing. Some nights they have karaoke, which Ive chosen to partake in a few times. Ive seen DJs there on the weekends, and I really like how they switch up the music genre each time. Sometimes its rap, others rockabilly and oldies. On Tuesday nights they do FREE swing dancing lessons and Ive been really wanting to try that! i love the vintage feel to the place and am surprised its not packed all the time!"
5,"This is the best restaurant chain EVER!!!!  I love EVERYTHING there and the service has always been A+.  The fried zucchini strips (appetizer) are the best in the world, the Caesar salad is the best I ever had, even their croutons on the salad are better than any!!!  Olive oil herb dip is Fabulous, the warm bread is like no other.  Most of the dinners that I have tried have been excellent but the Chicken Bryan is magnificent.  Waiters and manager the best."
3,"I love to eat here, however it is hit or miss. Sometimes we get good service and other times we dont. Sometimes the food is really good, but other times its off. Our order is usually messed up, but they are good about fixing it. One thing I have a problem with is using coupons here, I had a coupon for a pizza and also ordered an appetizer at happy hour half off. They did not want to combine the two offers but the coupon didnt say say anything about that.  When the food is good though its really good, which is why we return."
5,"They have a limited time thing going on right now with BBQ chicken pizza (not sure how long its going to last) but let me just say it was amazing.  Probably THE best BBQ Chicken pizza I have ever had.  I have tried other things too, like the tomato basil soup, and many of their sandwiches ... very good, very fresh - every time.   The 5 stars is for the pizza, but if I were to rate Jasons Deli over all they would get about a 4."
4,No matter what I order I know it will be tasty. Maizies have a lot to choose from which can be a little overwhelming for me. I love their wait staff everyone is always friendly. When I am in Maizies I feel like I am in a neighborhood hang out.
1,"I was so, so hopeful.  October in Scottsdale, yummy, tacos.....Wow!  Rip Off!! $10 Just to get in (what was that for?). No shade unless you were buying a drink.  Most places wouldnt give you salsa or taco sauce with your measly over priced taco. They seemed like the vultures who didnt care about the customer, just the $2 ticket they could grab from you.   I had to beg for a napkin then hunt for a place to sit feeling watched by the other vultures waiting for me to get up. I was ready to leave after 45 minutes and my Pepsi had gotten warm, so I had gotten a cup of ice from the bar.   I poured it in, took one drink and as I was leaving to hike back to my car, security stopped me and would nt let me take it out! ""It could have booze in it"".  Well, by then, I was one angry little local. Dumped it all in trash and said to my sweet daughter in law who was about to ""go mad"" with me, ""Get me outta here!"". She had brought her 2 year old, thinking what a fun way to spend a Saturday morning and encourage our local businesses.  Nope.  Not good."
1,Wow?!  Is this the new Barcelona?!  Yuck!  Old scuzy men and middle aged women with fake boobs that are falling out of their painted on dresses.  All bars were completely under staffed on a Friday night.  We waited 7 minutes at the front bar until being ignored continuously and we became so frustrated that we made our way to the round bar and it seemed just as understaffed.  Whats the point of only having a few bartenders on probably the busiest night of the week for bar-goers?  We even approached the blond manager to ask for service and she was completely rude and had a total lack of desire to help us.  We will NOT return due to the lack of service and efficiency.  This place has GOT to staff more bartenders and needs much more help.  Welcome to North Scottsdale Barcelona.
2,"Abridged:  Im gonna be real with you. I am not in love with Pizzeria Bianco, and had I actually had to wait in line, this rating would probably be lower. My group was lucky enough to receive the last table without any wait. Maybe it was the fact that its hard to impress me with pizza. Maybe it was a fluke that wont happen again. At least thats what everyone keeps telling me. But honestly, I just wasnt that impressed with the $19 pizza I received. Sadly, the leftovers I took home ended up being tossed because I was afraid to try it again.  Ive been worried about writing this for awhile (its been sitting here unfinished for nearly a year), but in the end, my opinions havent changed, and I sit here, still scared to return. If someone dragged me there again, or had a party there or something, Id probably give it another shot, as I hate to write off any place after a single trip, but I honestly felt just eh about the whole thing. Thankfully none of my visiting out of town guests have cried for me to take them there."
5,"Rivas helped me get through numerous late night study sessions and early morning hangovers!  Hard to go wrong with anything on the menu, but my two faves are the Carne Asada and Chile Rellano burritos...with fresh horchata, of course!"
4,"Recently a friend at the gallery was very excited because it was Dollar taco night a Chicos.  That is fine if you have any idea of where it is.  Turns out I had been by there more then a few times when I went to the Safeway and Subway at 7th st and McDowell.  Its a little place in a very small strip center.  Its very much a neighborhood place,  clean with an upbeat atmosphere and a few tables outside.  Thats about all I can say about the setting. I was surprised by the variety of meats that one can get on the tacos.  The tacos arent  to exciting but on the whole are fresh and have a good flavor better than I would have expected.  That is all I had but from what I saw of the meals around me, hey looked pretty good as a whole. I will go back to Chicos.  It definitely has fare that is better than the local fast food in the same price range.  Not an exciting place but pleasant to think of returning to.  I went there after a very long day so that is saying something.  Just the enjoyment of quite of the few people just sitting down and having a good time rubbed of on me.  I needed it!"
4,It was pretty good. But I dont know much about Indian food. It was better than the only other place Ive been too which had dirty grey chicken in its dishes. Taste was good.
5,I am a Regus member and could get wait here since I could use my membership card. Its a great place situated on 3rd floor with awesome city view.  Complimentary menu is refreshing. Cordial staff. Quiet and relaxed environment. Many TV screens and seatings to get comfortable with.
5,"2nd time I went to Grazie and both times it was excellent. The service is fast and attentive and the food great. The portions are huge so there is no problem to share the starter or the thin crust, wood-fired pizza ... So far I had the Dame Edna and the Roma pizza and both were very tasty. The wine collection is great and has some very interesting stuff which includes also less expensive wines. Havent made it to the desert menu yet as both times there was no space left ..."
5,"I am one step closer to completing my goal.  I want to visit every Grimaldis in the US before I die.  After tonights visit to this one, I have most of AZ taken care of. We decided to come here because we had never been to this one.  We arrived and were seated right away.  Surprisingly this one wasnt crowded at all and that was fine by us.   We got a small caesar salad, a small pepperoni and garlic, and a personal white pizza with roasted red peppers.  A few minutes later we got our salad.  It was really good.  Just enough dressing, lots of cheese and croutons.  It was a good starter.  A few minutes after that, our pizza came out.  If you have read my other reviews, you will know that I think Grimaldis is the best.....this pizza was no different.  I really liked the white with roasted red peppers.  Everything was delicious and even though there was some doubt we could finish off 2 pizzas, I turned on my inner fat boy, and finished off all the pizza.  It was tough, but someone had to do it....little kids are starving in Africa somewhere....lll be damned if Im going to waste some slices of this amazing pizza.  Down the hatch it went....my stomach doesnt like me right now because its so full, but he will forgive me once he doesnt get any of this delicatessen back in San Diego LOL."
3,"Mi Patio is a solid 3 star restaurant. Some days the food tastes better than others. And some days the entertainment value is better than others. But its not a chain, its within walking distance and has very affordable margaritas. Theres no bike rack (ugh) and the taquitos are basically a carne asada taco with no toppings (which I happen to like)."
4,"This place is great to go to for a chill and low key atmosphere. You can play billiards, cornhole, or video blackjack.  One thing I didnt like: one of the bartenders told me there is a $10 minimum to use my credit card and I think he was trying to hustle me because when I went back to close my tab (without buying another drink), the other bartender took my credit card. Otherwise, a nice chill place to go."
4,"Before a Suns game recently, my Family and I stopped into Blue Hound for some drinks and appetizers.  We attempted to go to Arrogant Butcher (been there many times), but it was packed.  Having heard good things from another family member, we decided to give Blue Hound a try, and Im glad we did.  The inside decor is trendy and simple.  We sat at the couch by the door (since that was what was available) and were quite comfortable - except for the occasional draft from the door.  Our waitress was ok, she wasnt entirely too friendly, but she took care of our needs. As for the food, we ordered pretty much all the appetizers.  The biggest highlight was the scones with bacon jam.  In fact, it was so good, its inspired me to make these two things at home to see if I can replicate it.  We also had the popcorn, which was good and the sliders, which were alright.  The pizza with duck was great (could have been crisper) as was the other items we had. Based on the previous reviews it seems this place, being new, might be hit or miss.  Id say give it a try if youre in the area... why not?  Trust me, its worth a visit for the cheddar scallion scones with bacon jam!"
3,"For cheap pizza, its as good as it gets. More selection than the other cheap pizza places, and the quality is way better.  The wings are delicious also, especially the Cajun flavor!!! If your looking for something like one of the big chains, then go there, but this is good for the money. If you want gourmet pizza, then go pay for it, dont look for it at the bargain places.  I paid $29 for an XL pizza with two toppings and 20 wings, and everyone was happy!  Just know that its really fast pizza, but its better than the other big guys!"
4,"Very consistent, thin crust pizza, made with fresh ingredients and excellent cheese! The market place is lively and the atmosphere is festive!"
3,"Its refreshing to find one-of-a-kind places -- God knows Phoenix needs more of them to inject personality into this generic, strip-mall, chains-on-every-corner valley. Finding this unique sandwich shop, which is in a house that has been transformed into a restaurant, is indeed a welcome find. The real estate is limited, so parking is compact and circles around the back of the building. The dining area is mainly indoors, but there is also a small patio facing the back portion of the parking lot, which is not very scenic. Inside there is art on the wall that can be purchased. They serve wraps, bowls and salads. The food has been pretty good, although it did not knock my socks off. I ordered the Baja Bowl, which is described on their online menu as ""Southwestern chicken atop garlic rice, black beans, Monterey jack cheese and topped with lime sour cream and pico de gallo."" It was OK, but the chicken was dry and cut in fairly large chunks. It could have possibly been microwaved -- not sure, but there were no southwest flavors to speak of. I have done a better job of cooking chicken on my George Foreman grill at home. Perhaps the garlic rice would have helped with the flavor, but I had substituted the rice with organic brown rice which did little to add flavor. Sour cream was not ""lime"". There was a small slice of lime served on the edge of the bowl. I would not bother ordering this again -- especially if I have a craving for some southwest food. On another recent visit I ordered a wrap called ""Prince of Thais - Spicy peanut chicken with baby spinach, garlic rice, fresh ginger slaw, cucumber pico and red onion wrapped in a spinach tortilla."" That had better flavor than the baja bowl. Vegetable ingredients were fresh and good. Again, I was not very impressed with the chicken chunks. One thing I think Thats A Wrap needs to address is the use of styrafoam cups. Afterall their slogan is ""Healthy Food for a Hungry Planet"" and they have a link for a new restaurant ""Green"" for Vegan food on their website. For such an artsy, earthy place, I would have thought Thats A Wrap would have made more conscious, earth-friendly choices. For that reason and the bland chicken, I give them an average rating only."
5,"Ritas Kitchen is a hidden gem located right smack in the center of the Camelback Inn. While this may be a hot-spot for hotel guests, I think that locals might be missing out on its charm.  I am a huge fan of anything the Camelback Inn does, especially since they offer live music and a great space for relaxation and Ritas Kitchen is no exception. This restaurant is airy and opens up to the spacious Camelback Inn patio where they play live music every night.  Breakfast:  Breakfast at Ritas is sublime and pretty reasonably priced. They offer a breakfast buffet for around $23 which includes eggs made to order (including omelets), pancakes, waffles, pastries, fresh fruit, bacon, sausage and hashbrowns. Its a great pick for a leisurely weekend breakfast. Just today was Mothers Day and while we only did the breakfast buffet, I did catch a glimpse of the Mothers Day brunch and holy moly do they know how to wow a crowd! Not only did they have stations set up all throughout the restaurant, patio and R-Bar, but they also had an extensive dessert area with build-your-own sundaes, freshly made cotton candy (in an old fashioned cotton candy maker) and a long dessert table with a chocolate fountain.  Lunch: Lunch here is sublime and I also enjoy either the tacos or the chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich is particularly a favorite of mine due to the cheese and sauce. The fries are tasty as well and you can either get sweet potato or regular. I also get sweet potato then regret not just getting the regular which are better in my mind. If the weather permits, sit on the patio and enjoy the beautiful water fountains, views of the mountain and tropical/desert setting."
1,"My husband and I heard great reviews about this restaurant and we decided to give them a shot. One word can describe this place GROSS!!! The food sounded great but then you took a bite and ewww disappointment. The salsa was lame, the chips stale. There were only two good things about this place the soda and the waitress was nice. Other than that dont waste your money GO TO ABUELOS...it may be on the west side but it never disappoints."
4,"I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this place. When I first saw the address, I was very skeptical. It is in Sunnyslope. I literally had to tell myself that there are still some gems on Central and that this place was probably one of them. Im so glad I had that talk with myself. This place is nestled into a great little area of shops and cute patio homes, small businesses and a school. They have a great atmosphere, the inside has roll-up, garage doors and there is a huge patio.  My friends and I settled into one of the sofa areas and made ourselves comfortable. They have a decent happy hour, all wines are 1/2 off and beer is $2.00 off. We ended up having some wine and a selection of brushetta, all was pretty yummy.  The brushetta wasnt the best I have ever had, but there was a nice selection and it was pretty tasty.  We had the brie and apples (delicious, how could you go wrong), mozzarella and tomatoe (also really yummy), brie and bacon which I didnt try and the tapenade (a little salty, but what can you expect from chopped up olives?).  Once happy hour ended, our very knowledgeable and helpful server told us that for $20 we could get a bottle of wine and another order of brushetta, so we did. Hey, why not, its Monday!?!  Ultimately, I was only supposed to stay for an hour (I was sick and jet-lagged and just needed to go home) and I ended up staying for almost four hours. As it got darker, the place took on a very sexy, relaxed vibe. I definitely like the place and I will be back.  Good atmosphere, good food, reasonable prices and friendly service."
5,Food is outstanding! Rebecca rocks!!!!!!
4,"What The Duce!? For starters, where the heck is this place? At first, I wasnt sure if I should be walking in simply because the factory workshop look threw me off!  Um ... hello?  No worries, once we walked into the store area thats when the fun started.  This place really got my interest.  Seems to me you can purchase some vintage items and clothes.  They had stadium-seating area with a projector screen, an ice cream shake area, boxing ring, and a small gym -- where the heck am I!    We finally found the restaurant area shortly.  The kitchen is an old school food truck, then again everything about this place is old school; chairs, tables, etc.  I ordered the sliders because it was a recommendation - meatball, chicken sausage, and bbq brisket.  A bottle of coke -- yep it figures.  Meatball sliders were the best of the 3, the sausage was definitely and acquired taste.   My sis, had the eggs and avocado one and it was okay.   I enjoy my visit to the Duce simply because of its odd ball nature.  Its definitely an experience wortha visit.  -  Enjoy!"
4,"Pleasantly surprised, great drink specials and cute outdoor seating. Food was really good and I look forward to going back!"
3,After our fav Mongolian place closed I was set on having Mongolian the night we came across AJs. It was decent.  It seemed a bit over priced.  The soft serve was kinda gross and the chocolate was out of order.  The all you can eat soup looked like it had been sitting there for a good 8 hours.  Will I go back? Maybe.  Was I impressed? Not really. Did I leave full? Yes.
5,"Excellent food! I do say the service isnt always the best, but the outcome of the food exceeds my expectations. Definitely recommend ordering the Artichoke Salad! Not what youd expect out of a typical boring salad! Not just stuffed with a large amount of dull, boring lettuce, but filled with spices and tons of flavor."
2,"So Ive been back to Ra a few times now, and while the food is always acceptable, the service has gotten progressively worse each time. Today my co-worker and I actually waited an unbelievable 50 minutes for our food, which - if your waitress stops by, checks in with you, apologizes, lets you know she knows youve been waiting - wouldnt have been nearly so bad. Still extremely annoying, sure, but forgiveable. Not this waitress - we had to call her over for every thing we needed. Serioulsy, not once did she just stop by to check on us. We had to call her over to place our drink order, ask for sugar for our tea, to place our food order, to get the check, everything. So by the time the food came, I had to scarf down my grilled apple teriyaki salmon brick in 5 minutes to make it back to work on time. Thats it, Ra - youve lost another customer."
4,"Good drinks, great food, and cool music. There is a stage right behind the bar. We tried the Fingerling Potatoes in Tomato Jam and it was fantastic.. I recommend."
4,"We just go there for lunch and its always very good.  I got a burger and a stella.  Both hit the spot.  Our bartender was spot on. Only complaint, please clean that crap up off the floor come on."
5,I had a mani/pedi and they did a wonderful job every time I visit.. The place is clean and the specialists are very nice..
4,"Feels a lot like Thats a Wrap (which used to be in this location).  I love the overhead door; I love fresh air.  Lots of seating and a bike rack (that doesnt really properly serve a lot of bikes, honestly). Food was very, very fresh.  I expected (per norm in most places) corners to be cut where not noticeable (see: frying something often masks its lack of freshness) - corners were not cut.  The three things ordered were all well prepared, fresh and delicious.  The things I oversaw on other tables were also looking mighty tasty. Id love to see a few bottles of craft beer here - thats my personal opinion.  Part of the issue is local laws, the other part is those running the show. Will return, for sure."
3,"A-OK is right and the hype is not always worth the wait. I will keep it simple since there are probably 500 reviews on the place. Pros: Great Hashbrowns, and made from scratch food Good specials to keep things mixed up Great company and service Cons: Guy up front says a little over 35 minutes but really means an hour and 45 minutes Pricey for some dishes Interesting people around while you wait to get inside (street walkers, etc.) the fresh squeezed orange juice is enough liquid to maybe fill up a double shot glass Overall I would love to give this place more stars if I could get in there without wanting to eat a finger due to starvation, and leave a bit more satisfied. Anyone who has eaten at Bryans in San Diego would know what I mean."
5,"Ive been a regular here the past 3 years. Other than the wait being long, the five spot sandwhich and waffle make this place one of my favorite in the nation."
3,Good destination for pizza. Would frequently go there for a slice at lunch when I worked in the area. Nice New York style pizza with a crisp crust.
5,Great Brisket. There has not been good BBQ in south Scottsdale for a long time. There is now!. The food is wonderful and priced well. Stop in and grab a bite.
5,This is my favorite pho joint in all of Arizona. I have been to about 17 from flagstaff to mesa to central and Tucson! The owners are so welcoming and very proud of their business and it shows! The place is always clean and the bathrooms are immaculate! I always order pho Tai and water.. But Ive had both their egg rolls and spring rolls both excellent! I love the broth! Its true pho broth.. Its not the beef bullion cubes other place use and you can defiantly taste the difference! The sprouts are the cleanest I have ever seen! I love this pho place ...  try the greatest pho in Arizona!
2,"Returned here after a years absense. I understand they have had a change in management. some for the better, some for the worse. new general manager and now the service seems much friendlyer and efficient. New chef and now food is slow to arrive and not as good as it used to be. steak was charred, mashed potatos were lukewarm. Took over 30 minutes for our food to arrive. hopefully it was just an off night for the kitchen. but the general feel was that they lost the attention to the little details"
5,"I have been attending Az Combat for the past 9 years and the instructors are fantastic. They teach Kickboxing, Jui-jitsu and MMA classes. Az Combat was one of the very first MMA Gyms in Arizona and have a great reputation as one of the top 10 training gyms in the nation. My daughter has also been at this school for the same amount of time and has taken advantage of many of the classes they offer including their boot camp. I would highly recommend this gym for beginners and the advanced  looking to break into the MMA circle. They have produced some of the top named fighters in Arizona."
1,"I would give this place NO STARS but Yelp! wants me to give at least one.  I went here with my boyfriend last night for dinner and next to our awful Bucca di Beppo (Scottsdale) experience, I have to say, this one is on my list of MOST TERRIBLE restaurant experiences. The service was so bad, we didnt even get to try the food!  True Yelper that I am, I did my homework before suggesting that we come here for dinner. I saw all the reviews about the ""bad service"" , but I paid more attention to the ""Cheap"" and  ""Delicious Pho"" reviews because after all, you cant knock it til youve tried it. Yes, the place looks as divey as any food dive gets, yes the place isnt as clean as it probably can be, but hey, all the best pho Ive  had (Da Vang, Khai Hoan, Pho Thanh) has been from some of the diviest pho spots in town.  I was excited.  It was around 6pm and the place wasnt busy (there were 5 other customers besides us, and 3 of them were on their way out), so we went ahead and sat ourselves down. The server gave us menus, and made her way back behind the cash register.  After looking over the menu for less than 2 minutes (I usually go for the spring rolls + everything pho whenever I visit a new spot), we were ready to order. I tried to make eye contact with our server but she seemed to be preoccupied with laughing and talking with the pre-teen sitting behind the counter with her. I finally made eye contact with her, she looked at me and I looked at her, and she turned back to her conversation. For the next 15 minutes I tried to get her attention to alert her that we were ready to order - no luck. But then I noticed that both her and the girl she was talking to were looking over at us and laughing, occasionally pointing in our direction and laughing some more. I wasnt about to give up because I was determined to try some of their well-reviewed food, but after a quarter of an hour spent trying to get their attention with them just laughing and pointing at us, my boyfriend and I had enough. The way they treated us was disrespectful and humiliating, so we walked out and drove across town to another Vietnamese restaurant.  We are never going back to this restaurant, and I suggest you dont either. Just as it isnt acceptable for customers to be rude to restaurant staff, it also isnt okay for restaurant staff to be blatantly rude to customers who have not done anything to deserve bad treatment. We did not deserve the type of treatment we got at this restaurant and I am seriously fuming with anger as I write this review. I dont care how delicious and cheap your food is, you cannot use that as an excuse to make customers who come in feel like somehow they are undeserving individuals.  Thanks, but no thanks, Pho House. I dont need to feel disrespected and belittled just so I can try your cheap Vietnamese food. I have plenty of Vietnamese friends who have moms who can probably cook better than you can and will treat us a million times better than your staff did last night."
3,"After hearing all of the hype on diners, drive in and dives and reading the yelp ratings, we decided to try it.  We waited over 30 minutes  for a table.  The place is small and outside of a dungy motel.  The service was extremely fast once you got in the door and the waitstaff are very friendly.  I had a waffle and it was good but nothing memorable.  My partner had an omelette with portguese sausage that he loved.  The hash browns were so buttery and they were good.   I wouldnt make a special trip back."
4,"Great ambiance, good food.  My husband and I had the Southwest Benedict and Eggs Benedict, both were delicious.  I do wish the eggs were a bit more runny and the food was warmer, but the presentation was beautiful."
4,"Im glad I made a second trip to Papago before writing a review, because they have redeemed themselves from my original visit. The problem with my first visit was two-fold: 1) The beers that were most interesting to me had run dry; 2) The food I ordered was pretty hard to grunt down. And although I sat at the bar with my compadre and tried to make conversation with the bartender about the different beers offered, it was fairly one-sided. I did not get a dose of craft beer expertise from what is arguably a brewpub that showcases a true love for beer. So regardless of the less-than-stellar first visit, I still was impressed with the selection of draft beer especially the regional offerings. The built-in beer coolers are also a testament to a great place to sample different labels. The one thing I must caution others against is the food. The steak sandwich I ordered (with special gardiniera) was pretty lousy. The beef had a precooked-then frozen-then reheated quality. The gardiniera was essentially all jalapeños and too fiery to eat... I had to scrape a fair amount of them off to make it edible. I had a good time drinking some decent beers with my friend, but we both regretted our food choice. My return visit restored my faith. The beer list was current and updated. There was a large variety of new draft beers to choose from, and my group ordered two pizzas. This place has delicious pizza! Our waiter was especially knowledgeable about the beers being offered and was able to help us choose especially interesting ones. I like the atmosphere and crowd at Papago and intend to return. But I will definitely stick to the pizza."
3,Its okay. its nothing like San Francisco food .
3,"A girlfriend and I have been meaning to check Bombay Spice out for a while but have never gotten around to it until last night. (I found a great deal on LocalDines.com -use ref # 102729 if you sign up! Also, checking in with FourSquare got a us a deal! )  We ended up going a little later (8ish) so there wasnt a wait or a crowd at all which was nice because the venue is a little smaller. The bartender was very friendly, our serve was a little distracted and took a little longer to respond to our needs but she was very nice. We both had wine, the ""single glass"" serving is actually 2 glasses in case you are torn between splitting a bottle for $20 or just buying a glass for $6.  I recommend the Falling Star Cab, it was full bodied and very yummy. The other wine we tried was the Hob Nob Pinot Noir. It was great, it had a delicious combination of earthy and sweet tones to it. (I am not very good with wine lingo, but those are my unofficial terms that make sense to me.) Neither of us were very hungry but we wanted to sample the fare so we could at least see if we wanted to come back. We got to choose either a free humus or a dessert because of my deal for checking in on FourSquare (POWER NERD! I know.) I really wanted to try the mango sorbet but we opted for the chickpea hummus and roti bread. For those of you, like me, who arent sure what roti bread is- its much lighter than pita bread and a little thinner than a tortilla. Its very tasty. The hummus was very good, and they garnished it with diced tomatoes, onions and cilantro which i loved! We also ordered the seared eggplant. It was AWESOME. It was a large slab of eggplant with a black sauce that was herby (thats a technical term in case you were wondering). They also served the egglplant with a yellow sauce drizzled on the plate which was sweet and very good, in addition to a small scoop of a red chili sauce (our waitress told me the name and I couldnt remember it for the life of me) which was spicy...I really loved this sauce it was the perfect amount of spice for the eggplant.  I will be going back here to try the curry and some of the other things on the menu i cant pronounce.  There are a LOT of vegetarian/vegan dishes clearly marked on the menu. Their menu also boasts that everything, except for 9 or 10 items, is completely Gluten free. Good experience, definitely looking forward to trying it again for a full meal."
4,"Very fun atmosphere and really good tasting food. Portions were large but not overwhelming so. Banana walnut pancakes were fragrant, tasty, light, and just the right balance between salty and sweet. Eggs Benedict was also very very good.  Definitely a place to frequent often as long as you dont mind a line, counter ordering, and finding a place to sit without a hostess."
4,"Good food, good drinks, fun bar. There are quite a few Buffalo Wild Wings in the valley and theyre a fun place to grab a quick lunch or dinner and watch the game.   They have a pretty good garden burger and their buffalo chips (french fry-ish things) are really good.  If you like bloody marys, they have the best one. Its so good...really spicy and filled with celery and olives.  Be careful when you come though, if there is a game on, youll have to get there early or you definitely wont get a spot to sit."
4,"Very good Rubios, very accommodating for my diet needs and the kids love their taquitos.  It is in a convenient location when you are shopping and dont have time to go home.  The management seems to be on top of things and keep the place very clean."
5,"Mmm dirty hipster bars.  Let me count the ways in which I love you. You are cheap (we had $2 Stellas) You are interesting (local art on the walls that Im told changes regularly) You are full of pretension (people watching is always worth the price of admission) You are friendly (like minded souls can smell each other out) If you are in the Roosevelt district, I highly recommend stopping in for happy hour.  Its cheap and hipstery.  Both words have been used to describe me, so I am naturally predisposed to this place."
3,"We were still on a search for New Mexican food and I read up on this place and it was also recommended by a friend.  It was average, not very New Mexican.  I tried the pecan grilled shrimp tacos and they were good! My boyfriend got the stacked enchiladas which was just ok.  Still on the hunt for good New Mexican food in AZ."
3,"Came for dinner with a friend with the $2 off coupon. The service was attentive, friendly, and overall excellent. The english conversation is less than stellar but the fact they took off $2 from both of our meals more than makes up for it. Still a little pricey for two gals with small appetites but not bad. Pani poori, naan, mango lassi, hot chai tea, tikka masala, paneer makani, lamb curry, and many other options available. I would avoid the gross spaghetti noodle option and awkward as it sounds mango flavored other fruit custard.  Overall a good experience. My favorite part is that the separators still have bears from when it was a black bear diner!"
5,"When I first stepped into Smeeks, my entire face lit up, I was figuratively (and quite literally) ""a kid in a candy store.""  Its is a true one of a kind store, its so entertaining to just walk around in. The decor is fun, the inventory is even more fun, and the photo booth is by far the most fun! The walls are full of great novelty items, such as the Smoking Baby (that actually smokes!), Yodeling Pickle (that actually yodels!), and Fake Cigarettes that are surprisingly realistic! Plus, Smeeks has a lot of really cool, and delicious candy. My personal favorite was the Fat Pig organic chocolate bar (with Puntini coming in a close second).  Smeeks is most definitely my new favorite store in CenPho!"
4,"This place is so cute.  To begin, it is trendy but comfortable.  The service is fantastic and the food is really good.  We were a party of six, and ordered a few appetizers (the deviled eggs were good) and for lunch, many of us did half flatbread/half salad..for a reasonable $10.  Mine was delicious.   I had a blueberry salad which was really tasty, and my margherita pizza was great.  The sun-dried tomatoes were perfect.  I will be back for sure when Im up for drinks....a wee bit early for drinks today as we ate at 11:15."
4,"Ive been here a couple times and from reading other reviews, I must have come on a good night!  Both times I was here we sat on the patio and really enjoyed the atmosphere.  They have a large rock pit? in the middle that they light when its cold for heat.   I really love the mussels in the white sauce here and last time I also had the spinach salad.  It was delicious!  Fresh and served with the perfect amount of bacon vinaigrette. The service is good, nothing special - but what is with the waitresses wearing flip flops?  I just dont see how that is sanitary especially if theyre walking in the kitchen.   Overall it was good and Im sure Ill be back.  I keep meaning to come for happy hour when they have 1/2 price appetizers!  A bowl of mussels and a glass of Sauvignon Blanc is all I need for an inexpensive and tasty dinner."
3,"Dont go to Dos for authentic Mexican food or stellar service, youll be disappointed.  Go to Dos for a fun atmosphere, good Happy hour and cheap ""bar"" food... then youll be pleased!  Dos usually hits the spot after a hot day at the baseball game or for a first stop before a night out on the town.  It has all the essentials, food, ATM, toilets and a huge selection of booze!"
2,"This place is more miss than hit, I stop by here for breakfast on rare occasions and the food usually comes out more than slightly mangled.   The food is usually edible and the customer service at the window is always friendly.  Ive never had the experiences that Phoenician C has but I will admit that this can be one of the lower end McDs that Ive been to in this town. Curse you McGriddle!!!"
5,"After flying across the country we were hungry and as Ive done in many other cities, I went in search of pho.   I ordered the pho dac biet.  The broth was not oily, and packed with flavor.  The noodles were just right and there was a generous amount of tripe and tendon."
5,"Still my most favorite hot dog ever and I think the magic is in the presentation. Theyve got the best hot dog sleeve. It perfectly holds the dog, lots of chili and its not messy. Another must have is a Cherry Lime Squeeze; Sprite, Cherry flavor, squeezed limes and maraschino cherries."
4,"It was almost impossible for me not to stop here on the cab ride back from old town for carne asada fries.mmmm sooo good! I really only went there between the hours of 2-4am but, los betos never let me down."
4,Ive been here many many times and have never had a bad time. Everything has always been up to par. I literally have no complaints. AND - I recently dropped a personal check made out to me while getting cash out to pay my bill. The manager found it and mailed it back to my client. Talk about honest service.  BJs is our go to place for an easy weekend lunch. Their home brewed root beer is super good.
4,"I love this place!!! Lots of space and cheap, TASTY Mexican food. Not much more than that needs to be said."
1,"No.   If you ask me about eating at Papaya Thai, that is what I will say.  0 stars for the single kinda scattered and scruffy staffperson.   0 stars for the cook who cannot prepare an offering from the menu as the menu describes it. In this case, I was down to two remaining untried Thai restaurants within quick reach of the Valley Metro Limo, and both in Tempe.  The other half was in Tampa, and since he does not care much for Thai, I get the chance to try one.   The limo arrived at Southern and Mill at 5:17 PM, and connected me with another limo at Broadway. With traffic, getting to McClintock took nearly 15 minutes.  On exiting the limo, 5:50 PM, I walked back about half a block to the restaurant. On entering the restaurant, I picked up a menu and rang the bell and a somewhat harried staff person came to greet me.  He asked me where I wanted to sit, at a table with 1 bench looking directly into the side of a huge fish tank...or the next table, which would leave no buffer between myself and the only other table seated in the restaurant.   There are at least 120 seats in this restaurant.  Why so fiercely contain people in the first three tables close to the door?  You must get your business in fits and hurries and keeping only the 3 tables active is working for you?  Then again, your telling me you are the only staffperson does not surprise me.  The Help Wanted sign on the door was more than an indication that Help is NEEDED! When I was seated, staffperson offered to bring water.  The phone rang and he was off, as he offered another version of ""I am the only staffperson here...""  I looked at the menu and made my decision. In the menu, there is a $2 charge listed for sharing.  This goes against everything Thai I have ever known.  The traditional Thai meal has everyone enjoying some of each dish served.  Because of my proximity to the fish tank, I was quite up close and personal with the fish. The water probably isnt filthy, but the plexiglass tank is not helping the perception.  6 PM, as the cellphone chime reminds me of the passing of an hour.  I am waiting for water and a staffperson who can take my order. 6:01, the staffperson comes, bearing a pitcher of water and a (My eyes are rolling in opposite directions because I am either overworked or stoned) smile.  He filled up my glass and asked if I was ready to order.  I replied that I was and ordered Som Tom, the Thai name for the green papaya salad. Staffperson replied that he did not know the Thai names for the menu items.  The phone rang again. Staffpersons attention was no longer on me.  The phone, his Pavlovian stimuli, had taken him away.  I asked if he had heard me.  He replied that he needed to go answer the phone.  He asked if I minded waiting, as he was the only staffperson.  I said I would wait.  Off he went, in pursuit of electronic interaction.   6:10 PM, staffperson returns, apologizing for the telephone delay and asking about my order.  I ordered the papaya salad without the green beans and steamed rice on the side.  Staffperson took the order and went to the kitchen.  The phone rang as he left the table,  his pace quickening as he approached the phone.   6:18 PM, the door opens and 2 potential patrons enter.  The bell rings and staffperson rushes to the waitstand to greet 2 new patrons.   6:20 PM, staffperson returns. He brings the salad and a bowl of rice.  The salad that appears has some of the traditional salad ingredients along with ingredients that have no business being in the salad.  Som Tom does not have cucumber, shredded lettuce or cilantro.  On sending back the initial preparation, staffperson returned with the original preparation, advising the chef stated ""This is a traditional Thai presentation of the dish"".  I sent the order back, citing the inconsistencies and asking for a new presentation. 6:25 pm.  As I empty my water glass, the salad I received previously is returned, minus the cucumber.  In asking staffperson if this is a new presentation or if it is an attempt to correct the original, he replied that he did not know.  I stood and left.  While the advertisement on the window of the establishment says they have ""The Best Curry in the Valley"",   they will get no second chance to prove it to me.  For all the phone activity, there was no one who came to pick up a carry-out order.  Between this and the somewhat glazed staffperson, I have to wonder if this place is not a front for a drug business."
4,Excellent service. Thankyou Denise! Food was excellent...the two of us shared the C4 salad and a custom and pizza with a cappuccino and a latte.  Everything was very good and the portions big!
4,"Upon our overnight stay at Econolodge a few blocks down, the live lit sign along side of the street attracted me to try this restaurant.  I remember the menu vaguely, however did not forget the amazing breakfast special the other half and I ordered.  $6 for a plate of thick cut bacon, 2 eggs made your way, hash browns, and toast (white/wheat/rye, etc.)  Customer service was great, the hostess and waitress made us feel very comfortable!"
5,"Any parent with young children can vouch for me on this one...keeping the attention of a three year old is, to say the least, difficult. They need constant stimulation, otherwise, there very well may be hell to pay! Enter, the Childrens Museum of Phoenix! The facility is an old school, converted into three stories of pure fun and energy!  After you pay your standard $11/person older than 1 (or your $22 for up to four people with a Groupon), you encounter a three story art project that can only be described as AWESOME! There are multiple ways in which your children can traverse this mammoth. The various pathways challenge children in strength, balance, and critical thinking skills...all of the ways you want to challenge your child! After your child has lost interest in this room, you progress to the second floor. Here, children get to experiment with a really cool board that can only be described as ""Plinko-esque"". Here, children can alter the path of a falling object by changing different platforms. My daughter thought I was a genius because I was able to predict where her object would land every time...its a shame shell ultimately realize how routine that feat really is.   After Plinko, children can either go to the trike wash, build forts, or they can head to the art room. After some laps through the wash, my daughter wanted to head into the art room. Being that we went right before Halloween, our child had the opportunity to make black play dough (to make spiders), she got to paint on a giant rocket ship, and then she was able to make a spooky tree out of a brown paper bag. Such simple activities...such great opportunities! After cleaning all of the paint from her smock, we made the journey up...to the third floor. Here, children get to play grown-ups. Theres a mock supermarket that allows children to either shop, ring up merchandise, or work in the stock room of a miniature grocery store. After shopping, our daughter wanted to work at the little ice cream stand located just outside of the grocery. We had fake ice cream cones and sat at the tiny bistro set while we watched children make their way through the noodle forest. We then made our way to the end of the hall to race miniature race cars on roller skate wheels. Being only three floors, our day at the museum only lasted a couple of hours...but in those short hours, my daughter never stopped smiling! How on earth could you rate any place less than five stars when it brings so much joy to YOUR pride and joy?"
4,Fancy ladies with a few gays sprinkled in. This is NM Cafe! Popovers. Prawn and avocado salad. Glass of Sauvignon Blanc. Make your reservation under Candy Spellings name. You will get the BEST table.  Works every time.
5,"If you are looking for TLC in very unique pet products and family style customer service, Posh Pet Boutique and spaW is where you need to go. They have retailed my collection of Decadent Digs there for going on 3 years, since the first day she opened her doors. I have seen her business blossom and become the destination and extra sunshine of the Troon Area. Her loving warmth (sort of Doris Day way) makes you feel like you are in her home and makes want you to come back often. She carries a huge collection of class act merchandise from cute clothes to a killer Kitty high-rise and offers excellent grooming. She is worth the trip."
5,"If you are writing poor reviews you obviously have not eaten Susies Chile Verde con Carne.   I dream about it.  And I grew up in New Mexico!  The best  bowl of green chili stew or even better the green enchiladas with melt-in-your-mouth beef anywhere in town.  #13...dont forget the sour cream.    So you with the 2 & 3 stars go back and try the green chili and watch your stars become shooting stars!  Ive never tried anything else there.  Why would you when youve found green chili heaven? Man, just talking about it makes me drool.  Im headed out the door.....Susies here I come!"
3,"The owner of Vermont Sandwich Co. just contacted me and offered to make right what happened to me during my last visit.  Nice gesture but I had to decline.  I didnt write what I did for a handout but Im giving this place one more star for the offer. Vermont Sandwich Co is very highly rated.  For the owner to try to make right by one negative commenter among a multitude of positive, says something about the owners integrity. I think a return visit to Vermont Sandwich Co. may be in order..."
4,"I love the ambiance at Joes Farm Grill.  Its great to grab your food and sit outside at one of the many picnic tables.  Stopping there with the dogs after an afternoon at Cosmo Dog Park is a must!  There is something for everyone on the menu, from gourmet burgers (all I have to say is fontina! Yum!) to pizza, to ribs. Its also a great place to take out-of-state guests who just blew into town from one of those cold climates.  They are usually psyched to be sitting outside enjoying a meal during the winter without having a propane heater involved.   Make sure you go for a walk on the grounds too.  Its very relaxing and a great way to work off a few calories!"
3,"I dont know why it is that all these airports have such a major lack of seating.  The staff here are friendly, and security is quick, but I just wish theyd work on the gate areas and add more seats.  Need an example?  Sacramento Internationals new terminal."
4,"This is by far my hubbys favorite lake for bass fishing.  I am not a fan of waking up at 4am in the morning to get there by 5am...not for fishing.  Yes, that is all my boys do here. It gets really packed on the weekends by 9am.   When the water is low, it is not easily accesible from the picnic spots.  It also gets super windy, enough to go windsurfing (too bad its a long treck for us).   You really have to have a boat to enjoy this lake.  The absence of shade trees make the heat uncomfortable in the middle of summer, you might as well go to Canyon or Saguaro (my faves). I love the sharp edged cliffs juxtaposed against the crystal clear water.  Good photo ops. Why the 4 stars?  Like I said, my hubby loves fishing here for the bass.  For some reason, little bluegills like me.  I also like the floating porta-john and porta-jane...weird, but cool!  Whoever does the draining has a crappy job. All in all, it is a nice big lake and by far one of the cleanest too."
5,"This is a great little authentic Mexican restaurant - dont let the looks fool you, it is delicious!  I had the Tampiquena, it is one of the best I have had.  Highly recommended"
5,"Clean, organized, and well-stocked (for the most part), Fujiyas carries my favorite car freshener, chips, bread, and iced coffee (in a can) among many other good things. Reasonably priced and extremely courteous customer service, I am always happy to shop there. The bentos, I wish, are kept in warmers like Suruki in San Mateo, CA, but Fujiya has an area adjacent to the register which includes a microwave to heat your purchased bento, so you can sit and eat and relax after shopping. What I love so much about their service is that I can place my order ahead of time and theyll have it available and ready. I think this is the only Japanese store that has just about everything I need to stock my pantry. Its no wonder Ive been coming here year after year."
3,"Service was fast and friendly, the mixed drinks are great!  We went on a busy Friday night and a lot of familys where there.  They have a man walking around making balloon figures.  The slide/ stairs is a great touch for kids.  The food was OK, nothing outstanding. The view was amazing, it overlooks the entire city."
3,"Excellent food, top-notch service, exorbitantly priced.  Not for budget minded diners..."
4,"My friend and I decided to try this place for happy hour around lunchtime since its such a short walk from ASU.  I ordered a glass of the crossing, which was tangy, and a little on the dry side with a fruity aroma.  Going off of a college students budget, we shared a plate of the bruschetta which was a bit pricey for 4 slices of baguette with toppings, but delicious nonetheless. Pulled pork and salmon were my two favorite! The atmosphere is great and its always lively and full of people- plus its a great location."
4,"I love the Penang Curry at the Thai House! Better than any other place Ive had. Too, the lunch special is one of the best deals in town. The spring rolls are pretty good, although Im not crazy about the sauce, its a bit too thick and sticky for my liking. The service is okay, during lunch they could use additional help, servers are literally jogging to service their tables. Overall, its a great spot - Im definitely eating there a few times a month if not more."
3,"Bad service, great food, awful coffee."
1,"The food is delicious.  The service:  discriminatory.  The bartender, blonde gentlemen, went around to everyone else, then finally acknowledge us.  This is embarrassing, I dont know what else to say."
5,"Delicious yet again! Pho, garlic green beans, papaya salad...they can do no dish wrong. The owner, Justina, is hip, cool, gorgeous and awesome! Its BYOB so bring a nice wine or beer...no corking fee so dont forget to tip well! If youre eating and theres a big line of others waiting, please do what we do and go across the street to gelato so that other people dont have to wait an hour."
5,Amazing food. Great date night place with an impressive wine list.  Definitely come her again and more often.
1,Experience with Hostess was rude. Service with a frown. Our waiter had attitude too. It was a birthday dinner and we were in great spirits..so this review is written with clarity. The margaritas were strong-check ok there. The shrimp appetizer was different and very good and $18 for four shrimp. We ordered two mahi mahi dinners (each $24)and they were RANCID. Yup. I said RANCID. We asked if the shrimp fajitas dinner had the same jumbo and they said they would have to charge extra (each entree was priced at $30) we had to pay extra for the beans and rice that they had left on the table-which was cold by the time the shrimp dinner--which came with 5 shrimp and onions.  Poor service with an attitude. Mediocre food to say the least...all over-priced. Never going back.
3,"I am an avid quilter and moved here recently. I am on the hunt for a new quilt shop and I went here, despite the ""grandma quilt shop"" name lol. The staff was VERY nice and helpful and friendly. The shop a little on the small side, which made me surprised to find that they have a very decent selection of contemporary fabrics! My only disappointment is that that they dont have fat quarters cut of each of the fabrics, though they will cut fat quarters - but thats not something I want to have to wait around for.  They carry a small selection of minky and home dec fabrics as well. I will definitely be back there!"
5,"When Im casual but want to feel NYC I go to Christophers.  We go here for a special occasion dinner or on the fly happy hour...which is the best HH food in town!  Let me repeat that - best in town!!!   Hamburger with truffle fries, brick oven pizza or a perfect salmon salad plus a beer or glass of wine for about $10/person. Cant beat it!  Sitting at the open kitchen makes me appreciate the setup and organization required to run a restaurant as well as the chefs tatts!?  If you dont want the blaring heat of the brick oven, dont sit at the corner next to it...Phoenix is HOT enough in the summer, so cool off and let someone else do the cooking!"
4,"I gave an extra star just because it is so fun to hang out here.  The waitresses are always cute and friendly and not afraid to pour your drink.  Alot of my friends are in love with the food here, I have to disagree. I think good but not great.  Still this place gets the nod from me just because it is so fun to hang out.  Chances are you will meet some new friends there too."
2,"I went because several people I know raved about the place, because Im a lapsed vegetarian and Im always trying to get back on track and heard the veggie sandwiches were incredible, and because Im a malt freak and found out they have malteds there. I was disappointed. And my friend I was with who had been one of Sticklers die-hard fans said that, although it was okay this time, the place seems to have gone down hill. Sticklers wasnt busy at all, maybe 4 tables of customers and 3 people in line, but although there were alot of workers behind the counter, the service was very slow. We had to wait a long time for our veggie sandwiches. Now my friend has been there when it was jam-packed and she said the service then was much quicker. We went about 2 so maybe the staff was worn out from the lunch rush earlier. The bread was good, crunchy on the outside and soft inside but the vegetarian sandwich itself was boring. Its supposed to have Swiss, Provolone and American cheese on it. I couldnt even taste the Swiss or Provolone at all, the American over powered the sandwich and was more like a cheez-whiz type. Im always on the look out for a good malt, one that really tastes like a malt and not a shake. My chocolate malt tasted more like a shake and I wasnt impressed with the ice cream. My buddy liked her vanilla malt though. The one thing I did like about Sticklers is that they have the small bags of Miss Vickies chips to buy. It used to be you could buy big bags in the grocery stores but now the chips,which are the best kettle chips Ive ever had, are just carried in certain deli and sandwich shops."
3,"Big fan of their SW Chicken Caesar salad and fire roasted tomato soup. My favorite sandwiches are the chicken panini, the turkey cranberry, and the teriyakki chicken wrap. I love both wildflower and Paradise but Paradise Bakery has the best cookies. And although I do not get it very often because its a killer in calories, the chocolate cheesecake brownie is to die for!"
4,"Grab a cup, grab an outdoor chair, enjoy the show!"
4,"This is a new neighborhood breakfast joint in a building many think is ""cursed"".  The turnover for businesses at this location is high.  But I think Oink is going to make it!  They were very busy when we were there so it took a little bit to get refills on coffee (need bigger cups) and the food took a couple minutes longer, but no worries.  Who I think is the owner was not just standing by and watching everyone else run around like chickens with their heads cut off, they were serving, clearing plates, filling coffee.  Love to see that!   The menu is decent.  Im not a huge breakfast person but there were quite a few items on the menu I was interested in.  The funny thing is my hubby and I ended up not ordering any bacon and didnt realize this until after we finished eating!  So we definitely will be going back to try the bacon they are known for....jalapeno bacon anyone!"
5,"I hardly ever get past their carne adovada. Its simply amazing. Add a couple of extra homemade tortillas to it? Cant be beat! I have had their pecan crusted sea bass also, along with lamb chops (chipotle?) both very, very good. Great atmosphere, friendly, competent staff...a winning combination. Get there early! Long waits after 6:00pm!!"
5,"I heart Romes Pizza!! Being a native New Yorker, I have struggled over the past two years to find anything remotely close to NY style pizza. I had tried many local, independent places, but no one got it right.  When I moved back to Scottsdale about 6 months ago my guy and I passed this place driving down McDowell road. I figured we could try it out (Im always on the look out for some yummy pizza). Dont be taken back by the empty parking lot and shabby exterior, after all, isnt it whats inside that counts??  The food is always fresh. The Greek salad is great - it comes in small and large. The pizza is amazing (as long as you know what youre getting - NY style). I know that its family owned, which I always have an appreciation for.  The man that owns it does most of the deliveries. When I first moved to the area I called for delivery and he had to call me because he couldnt find my street. Embarrassingly, I only knew the street I lived on and not much more, so I couldnt help him. He told me that it was okay and eventually found the house.  I expected him to get out of the car and give me a huge attitude, thinking Im an idiot because I didnt know where I lived (could you really blame him?). But he was as sweet as could be and told me it was no problem. How refreshing!  In a nutshell, hoooorray for Romes!!"
5,"I have been trying to get into a consistent workout routine for years... Ive tried it all! gym memberships, pilates, training for a marathon but was never able to stick with anything... until Karve that is! My husband found it for me on here actually and thought I should try it (not sure what he was trying to hint at with that... but i love my improved Karve body too much now to care :) Anyway, I went and am now hooked! it is the greatest work out ever - its hard but the results happen so quickly that its motivating... and its really the only workout routine that Ive ever been able to stick with ever!  and with going multiple times a week I found that it even changed my appetite - I no longer feel annoying cravings so eating healthier is easier for me (a former carb/chocolate fiend) It really helped me finally get into a more active/healthy lifestyle - I know that sounds so cliche but Im still shocked everyday that a lazyass/sweets-eating like me is actually working out on a regular basis - and its all bc of the great method of Karve.... plus the instructors are SO sweet and nice/friendly and supportive Im honestly making friends there... all in all a stellar review for Karve Studio!! im a believer :)"
4,I was very happy with the food and service. The service was wonderful and quick too.
2,"Nah. I forked over $13 for a club sandwich, mac n cheese, and a large Pepsi.  The mac n cheese was good, and the sandwich was just okay.  I say take your $13 and go to Texaz Grill!!!  WAY better food, and for $13 you can get dessert too."
4,"Good little place in old town across from Cowboy Ciao. Had the turkey apple swiss wrap w/ dried cranberries,local greens, smoked bacon, and cashews. Very good and great size. The lady had the grilled chicken & sage pesto sandwich w/ goat cheese, gala apple, and smoked bacon. She liked it as well. The sweet potato chips were very good too. will be back for sure."
5,"St. Francis gives the impression you could be dining in one of the finest cities in the world, instead of the 5th largest cities in the USA. Start with their cucumber gin drink, and then order another.  Goat cheese on crostini follows.  Insist on extremely memorable whipped potatoes--a side order-- to accompany your salmon on red quinoa.  Dessert MUST be the chocolate cake with peanut butter gelato accompanied by carmel sauce trailings and carmel corn garnishes. Try dining at the bar for an uncluttered view out the picture window opening, minus the glass. Loved it!  Will happily return. They split our entree for us AND were gracious about the extra trouble we caused--not a wimper.  Truly superior service !"
5,"Unfortunately I dont get enough chances to come here but, Id say I have been here about a dozen times and each time I have never been let down.  The beer is great, the food is great, especially their french fries and the crowd is OK.  Yes it is in Tempe and youre stuck with all the ASU kids but I like to come here in the summer time or when ASU is on break because it is the locals that are here.  It is not the nicest brewery that I have ever been to, but what they lack in aesthetics they make up for in beer.  A must go to place if youre in the Tempe area!"
3,"Yes I am writing a review about Red Lobster, dont judge me!! You all know you love those little cheddar biscuits more then life itself!  Seriously, Those biscuits, good lord!  Hubs and I went here last night, his picking. He loves him some Ultimate Feast. I usually stick to the coconut shrimp.  Our waitress was awesome, the place was packed to the gills but we never really had to wait for refills. She did forget to put in for the beer hubs ordered, but he lived (YAY)!  The food comes out hot and fast.  We also got an appetizer, did the ""pick two"" the mozzarella sticks were surprisingly good and the calamari wasnt just fried calamari but it came with fried broccoli and red peppers as well, super tasty!"
5,"I always buy my tires at Walmart, but they didnt have a tire to fit my car. They directed me to Discount Tire and told me that they actually have better pricing. I went to this location and had the best experience. They were very helpful, saved me money, and I was in and out in under 25 mins. I will be back again and again!!!!"
1,"Can someone please tell me why people go here??? Went to breakfast with Deb L, and she had a Living Social deal or one of those deal thingies. The place was packed, probably because its a holiday week. That doesnt excuse the EXTREMELY poor service. We sat down and waited. And waited. Servers walked by every few moments, nobody stopped to fill our water glasses or take our order. Finally, we both said something to a girl who walked by. She seems mystified that there was a job to do. With that many people working, getting a cup of coffee shouldnt take 15 minutes. Yes. 15 freaking minutes. Food? Mediocre at best. I got the traditional eggs benedict with home fries. The only saving grace with the amount of ham on it. The English muffin didnt seem to be toasted. The eggs were *ok* but nothing great. The home fries? My 9-year old niece could do a better job. My burps right now arent even good enough to brag about. Im sure if the service had been better, I wouldnt be so miserable right now. My food coma isnt satisfying. I will *never* go here again. Ever. I felt stupid leaving a tip, it was THAT bad.  Total. Fail. Blech."
4,"Kale, miso, shrimp dumplings... all good"
4,YUM! The flavors were great! Oatmeal cookie and caramel apple were great and tasted just like the real thing. The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 is because some of the toppings such as the twinkies and baklava were whole pieces and I wish I could have just grabbed pieces of them instead of a whole one...toppings like those could add a lot of $$ very quickly so I skipped those ones.
5,DUDE..where is the manga....where are the card tables. .....What the heck is this place doing selling comics! This is outrageous!  And why are you talking to me and trying to help me comic clerk! Your job is to give me a huge sigh and exasperated look as if I asked you to perform surgery. This being helpful and friendly is really bothering me. You guys are just too weird. I need to go back to Atomic.
2,"I cannot stand this mall. They have some really awesome stores but the people who work in them are obnoxious. Most of the people walking around are snooty as can be, and everything is overpriced. The food court has some good selection, but is always super crowded and you can rarely find anywhere to sit. Parking is awful."
2,"Absolutely, positively bitter. They use a powder in lieu of syrups which adds a after taste I dont care for. There was no color difference between my beverage (latte) and my friends (iced coffee). Why... I have no clue. We order these drinks everywhere and this has never happened before. I can see how a powder would be more cost effective but the taste was something I did not care for. Maybe that makes me a coffee snob, I am not sure."
4,"Maybe closer to 3.5 but I am rounding up because Im not opposed to being won over by ""smart"" bartenders -- when I ordered drinks she asked to see my ID and then followed it with, ""you look so young, you must get that often."" Granted, she looked younger than me, but I am not opposed to having my reviews swayed by cute bartenders who know the right buttons to push. In addition, the house margarita was good, and I have been known to throw bad margaritas all over the bar in a fit of rage when I dont get carded...fortunately my vanity was satisfied.  The space is very nice and open, and despite the decent size crowd, it didnt feel crowded. Our wait was less than 20 minutes and there is ample place to sit and have a drink while you wait. Now, I must say, I dont know that the required staff uniform is unattractive, but it does seem like an impromptu tennis match could break out any moment.  The braised short rib enchiladas were good and the fish tacos were even better. The tacos were slightly overstuffed and rather difficult to eat as a result, but the taste was good (3 shells, as opposed to 2, with the same amount of taco insides would be better).  While the waitress didnt attempt to win me over with flattery, the service was prompt and attentive."
2,"Took almost 45 mins for a oil change (they told me 20 mins when I got there) and it cost something like that as well...  Slow and expensive, not 2 things I like associated with my lube jobs."
5,I love this place! Great place to grab a quick smoothie or stay to hang out! (just let them know if youre in a  hurry) P.S. The phone number is area code 480 not 490 :)
4,"Couple things.  First, I am reviewing a Delivery order that I placed.  (If you didnt know that they delivered... Now you do!) You start by looking at their website, which is modest.  Its a black background with White text.  Pretty much all of their food is available for take-out, except for the alcohol. *TIP* Make sure to look at their PDF Menu.  It has TONS of more choices than what is listed on their Website.  I wasnt even aware of this fact until I had ordered my food. At this point, they do not have online ordering set up, so you call and place your order that way. Cornish Pastys (pronounced Pastie, not Pastey) are amazingly delicious.  They take whatever filling you choose (from the Chicken Alfredo to the Bangers and Mash), and they place it in a thin, crisp dough that surrounds it.  Think of a Calzone, except the Irish version. Now, these are very, very filling.  They are modestly priced (all of them are less than $10), and they are EXTREMELY DELICIOUS. Make sure you give them a try.  I will sure be eating here again!"
5,Just moved to AZ and this is my local Petco. Everyones really helpful and friendly. We just took our dogs here to get groomed and they came back smelling fresh and looking clean.
3,"3 stars is being generous. Went to Tesoro tonight with my husband and two teenagers based on the glowing yelp reviews.  It is a very small restaurant, 9 - 10 tables with a small waiting area out in front, facing the strip mall parking lot.  We had a reservation for 7:30.  Arrived on time and were apologetically told that our table was not yet ready.   Had to wait out front for 20 minutes shivering. After we were seated, drink, wine, and appetizer orders taken, we relaxed and began to settle in.  Problem was, it is a very loud room. Conversation was a challenge.  Looking around, we realized that we were the youngest table in the room.  Average age appeared to be 60+ years old. Oh, well, young and hip it is not.  Hopefully the food is good. Bruschetta and antipasto were tasty.  For entrees, we ordered the homemade Fettuccine Bolognese, Spaghetti al Pomodoro, the Chicken Saltimbocca and a special, Farfalle with shrimp and asparagus.  Flavors were good, not great, but none of the pasta was homemade.  Very much a disappointment. On the upside, service was very attentive and friendly.  Unfortunately, food is only mediocre, and the strip mall location is a definite detraction in size and ambiance.  Would I return again?  No."
5,"When people feel a cold coming, they pop a zinc lozenge or tablet to boost the immune system. I have a much better way to get my zinc supplementation: I head over to Pier 83 for their terrific fried oysters. With the first crunchy bite I begin to feel so much better. Placebo effect, probably. But hey ... as long as I get that feel-good boost, I dont care. The fish and chips are also the best Ive had in the Valley. And to think that Ive previously been trying to get my fish n chips fix from the likes of Petes ... yikes! And their clam chowder is delicious; I dont need to feel under the weather to have an excuse for ordering this tasty bowl of comfort. The friendly staff and comfortable informal atmosphere complete the enticement for many return visits."
4,"Very good coffee!  I get my iced Americano here with room for cream.  The coffee is so much better than the Starbucks down the street, but not as convenient...shamefully to say, theres no drive-through.  When you have a vehicle full of kids which one would you pick?  So, I come here solo right before I wander around the little shops.  A must try!"
4,We ate there last night and were very pleased our meals and service.  The ribs were especially good.  We would go back again.
4,"I just moved to AZ from Honolulu with my bf and found this to be a great breakfast / brunch place. They do close at 2:30pm. On my last visit, I ordered the amazing ""2 for you""! You get the choice of a half sandwich & either soup or salad for $7.95...WHAT A DEAL!! I ordered the  Monterey Club & the No. 5 Chinese salad. What an amazingly refreshing lunch! I highly recommend this day cafe, this may not be the best review, but if you stop by the line may sway you:)"
4,"Stayed here with my girlfriend for a Radiohead show and a get away weekend from work.  Got the hotel for the amenities which were great, we played tennis, enjoyed the fantastic people watching at the pool, great cocktails to include the Tequila Sunrise, and some light putt putt outside our cottage.  The room was not ready when we got there so we got a cottage which was supposed to be an upgrade with a semi private patio.  The room was actually very nice and had a great tv which we might have watched for a grand total of 30 minutes in 4 days.  Our room was made up between 4-5 each day that we planned to stay there and then on the day we plan to check out, they came by at 8:30....not sure what the problem was there.  We also had to call about our A/C after we sweated the first night but it was fixed and no problems after that so maybe it was just a glitch which happens.  You are probably wondering what if anything was wrong, the only issue we had was the concierge.....nightmare, no help whatsoever.  Called several times, both girlfriend and I and got the reply on two separate occasions to just check google.  I have stayed at less nice hotels and had much better service with concierge, this hotel should realize what their clients might be interested in and do some research.   All in all, great trip and a nice and above par stay.  I would certainly stay here again if I can get my girl to go with me!"
4,"I went here for happy hour with a long time friend. I wanted to try something new and Switch totally fit the bill. First off, their happy hour is A-mazing! I had two glasses of white sangria that were just perfect.  My friend and I shared the cheese and fruit plate because it was on special. It was nice to try everything, and since it was on special it made everything taste better. For my meal I had your traditional cheeseburger, and it was very good. I had half to take home which made for an excellent lunch the next day.  The only thing about the place that was a little strange was the crowd. I expected for having such an awesome happy hour it would be busier, however it was kind of dead. I even saw a group of people be seated and abruptly leave. It was kind of strange. Perhaps it was just an off night. This is definitely a place I would go to again!"
5,"I went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago with my bosses. It was packed on a Friday - we sat at the bar and our cook was fantastic! We got to sit and chat with him while he worked away at the orders. I had the chicken pesto pasty and it was wonderful! the bread used is similar to a pastry dough type...but not as sweet. The pasty was so filling, I could barely finish it. My bosses have been there before and have always wanted to try the peanut butter and jelly pasty - so we all split it as dessert and it was so good. They put bananas in it and drizzle jelly over the whole pasty. Its definitely rich and gooey.  I would totally go back here again and have told my friends about it too! Amazing place."
5,"I hired Property AZ to rent my upside-down home in North Peoria (stuck with the house so we rent it out), they are very experienced and had great customer service.  I have had bad experiences in the past with management companies not taking care of the renters or getting back to me."
4,"They try to be like In-N-Out, even down to the color scheme, but the burgers taste very different.  They offer cajun fries which have some extra seasoning, and if you ask for your fries ""well done"" they dont come out as soggy.  But if youre going with someone else, then one order of fries is all youll need.  They give everyone huge helpings of fries and Im never able to finish a single order so I just share it.  The burgers are excellent and the one thing that sets this place a part is the option to get fresh jalapenos on your burger.  Dont forget about breakfast!  This is where In-N-Out fails.  The breakfast burgers are great after a night of partying."
4,"We went there for the first time recently and was pleasantly surprised. We got there about 8pm on a Friday night and the place was still packed. We only waited maybe 5 minutes to get a table which wasnt bad at all.  My date had the BBQ Chicken Sandwich with a side salad. While we were waiting for his salad to come out the server came over and said there was a mistake as he should have already receive his salad and it would be right up, which it was so not a huge deal. A few minutes later our meals came out. While he was hoping it was shredded chicken it was a chicken breast but said it was still quite tasty. I had the 10oz rib eye with sides of green beans and applesauce. The steak was cut perfectly and it was a perfect size portion. The green beans (which the server suggested) were awesome and the applesauce was a nice sweet finish so no dessert was needed. Another bonus is everything (steak, beans, applesauce) were all served on separate plates so no runny juices mixing all over the place which was perfect!!!!  The prices were very reasonable as well.  Overall, we both enjoyed Texas Roadhouse and will certainly be back."
5,"Just did take out.  Great experience.  Easy to place my order over the phone, friendly service.  Nice that they have special pick up parking spots and entrance.  Made it an in and out operation.  Ordered the gluten free pizza with pepperoni and sausage.  My husband and son loved it and have already been asking to get it again.  I had the spaghetti calzone and was in HEAVEN.  I highly recommend it."
5,"Navajo Food at its best !!!!!! I loved everything there ! I guess I love ""BLAND"" food . :-) everything was terrific ...  I ordered the bowl (12 oz) of Mutton Hominy Stew I got it with the Tortilla bread which was AMAZING ! I also ordered a side of Blue Corn Mush to dip into my stew ( which is an awesome combination) ... And I also ordered a Grape Shasta Soda :-D ... My Husband ordered the Vegetable Mutton Stew with fry bread and ordered Strawberry Shasta Soda. He loved everything ! Everything was well worth the wait and the food was extra hot and tasted very FRESH !!! I LOVED IT !"
3,"The ever evolving menu changes again, But a coupon made it a decent buy. I will admit my co workers 2 for 1 coupon is why we went in. This means ~3.25 per burrito vs the usual $6 range. What I didnt like was that my vegetarian burrito did not have vegetables in it, it was just a bean and rice burrito with guacamole. I dont know how one gets the grilled veggies in their burrito but it is not by ordering a vegetarian burrito. The drink and napkin station here has always been a bottleneck, getting a refill or more napkins is nearly impossible. I do like the fact there there is Choula sauce in addition to the red and green tobascos. And I also like that the chairs are not nearly as bad as those at chipotle. The best tip this time is get in before 12, otherwise be prepared for a long long line."
5,"Jodi is fantastic!  Extraordinary!  After too many expensive yet less-than-average salon expereinces, my hair has been less beautiful than its potential.  Jodi gave me a very thorough consultation after I did some research to find the best colorist for me.  During my appointment, Jodi was professional, efficient and friendly.  I left the salon with soft, gorgeous hair... lovely color, care of the INOA line, and I felt beautiful again.  She did what at least half a dozen other highly recommended colorists did not accomplish.  Im ecstatic and relieved and I have finally found my colorist.  What more can a girl ask?  Thanks so much, Jodi."
4,"This place is yummy. The service might not always be, but the food is. They have a sexy bar and great intimate decor and a South West feel that isnt done with terra cotta colored paint and teal cacti pictures. I love the Jelapeno Benedict and they have AMAZING margaritas. And they serve brunch till super late."
5,"Awesome, awesome, awesome....everything was fantastic. The innovative drink menu, the pizza was out of this world and the bartender was very personable. A++ I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. Bant wait to return!"
4,"I met my cousin here for lunch, and we were really happy with the meal.  The place is a less than impressive on the interior, dingy booths, long and narrow.  Its terribly crowded up by the counter, not a lot of room to order and pick up your food. I do question how a place can call itself ""Los Taquitos"" and then not have taquitos on the menu, but I went for the flautas instead.  They were good, but what set the meal apart were the beans.  The most flavorful beans I have ever had.  If you told me these were magical beans, I would have believed it, but I wouldnt have stopped eating them to plant one and see. Service was quick and friendly and there was plenty of seating, even during the lunch rush.  Looked like a lot of people get orders to go.  Id like to go back and try a few other items on their menu, if they come with beans of course."
4,"I ate here on a Sunday afternoon and was impressed by the food quality, very friendly service, and speed of service. On the strength of other Yelps, I had the gravlux with dill mashed potatoes and tomato basil salad. All excellent as others have said. I had broccoli and cole slaw as my other sides. The broccoli was tender without being overcooked and the slaw was a pleasant vinegar-based, not creamy, variety that complemented the rest of the food nicely. The food filled the plate without being overwhelming and I found room for one of the Beaver cookies, actually two large waffle-wafer cookies with a lightly flavored lemon cream between them. The cookies are kept in a chilled pastry case, probably because of the cream filling. A pleasant meal on a hot summer day."
5,"Loved this place!!!! Was searching for a great authentic BBQ place, and this is it!!!!!"
4,Beautiful church!!  We started attending mass here after they brought Jay Soto on as their music director.  He has beautiful voice and also plays piano.  We like Fr. Robinson the best - weve heard all of priests except for Fr. Sullivan.  This is not a cookie cutter church - it feels like a real church with the stained glass and the stations.  My husband is of the faith - not me and Im not given a hard time for not taking communion like the other church we used to attend. I attend to hear the music and companionship for my husband.
4,"Im embarrassed at the number of times Ive eaten here since it opened.  i used to live half a mile from here and was one of the first people in the door.  The bruschetta is the best in town--period, end of discussion.  The salads sometimes arent my favorite, but there are plenty that are delicious.  Ill admit that the cheese plates also sometimes leave me wanting, but that is a rare occasion.  It has been interesting to see the wine selections evolve over the past several years.  When it first opened, Postino seemed to have nothing above $35/bottle, and that selection was good.  It stepped up its game in the past two or three years and now boasts a more diverse and more expensive selection (e.g., Sea Smoke pinot noir).  I appreciate the addition of even better wine, and am happy to say that the glass list remains reasonably priced."
4,"A clean shopping center with many classy options for food, drink and retail therapy."
4,"being new to the area, im really on a quest to nail down my basic food groups: thai, persian, and mexican. mexican ive got down i think, but the other two ive kind of been baffled by. luckily i have my very own personal tour guide who invited me to lunch at yuphas one day.  the place is pretty cute but can get pretty crowded when in the full swing of lunch. the tables are kind of close together, so be sure you arent carrying a big purse or anything otherwise youll be whacking people in the head with it. i had the pad thai for lunch. HUGE lunch portions. i could barely finish a third of it and i had a ton to take home for dinner. also if you arent into spicy, id definitely go mild. medium spicy is pretty groovin, but i dont think it would work out well for someone who only wants a little spice. yuphas also has an interesting salad bar/soup thing that comes with some of the lunches. check out the salad with the peanut dressing. mmmmmm peanut dressing. i loves it.  service is fast and friendly. take your check up to the front if you want to get out of here quickly. i think yuphas is going to be my work lunch thai place :). garlic beef here i come!"
3,"When Im on vacation, I try to go to restaurants I try to avoid chains because whats the point?  I want to eat local eats.  As I walked in, I realized Ive been to the one in Long Beach, CA though the menu was completely different. Or perhaps it was the late night menu but it was decidely more ""Southwestern.""  Ah well, it had been several years and it was quite late at night so it didnt matter at this point. I ordered the green pork tostada which the waiter assured me was very small and the hot wings. The tostada was huge. What a liar (yes, I called him that to his face).  I ate a couple of bites and finished the wings. I would have the tostada cold and congeal-y in the morning before flying out. Surprisingly, the flavors were locked in this way and acceptable as a 5-minute scarf fest.  Oh, and my vodka tonic was very good.  Not bad and I kind of dug our picnic style bench high top table."
3,"Eyebrows are a very touchy subject. Im literally convinced that unless you make some serious cash, finding an excellent and meticulous aesthetician is like finding a needle in a haystack. Well, Yelpers, Ive been searching in this haystack for three months too long, and each time I leave thinking, ""They really dont listen to what I requested and I wasted money."" So, I decided, no longer was I going to leave spending $20.00 (tip included) on mediocre brows. I went back to doing my own, and I am completely satisfied.  Plus, the music selection is terrible. A positive, its neat that they text you a 24 hour reminder notice. However, you better be sure you show up, because they do charge fees for tardies and no-shows."
3,"I decided to give this place a whirl yesterday on my lunch about 5pm from work  the space was nice open airy the staff from front of the house to The wait staff all were very friendly linens on the tables as well as linen napkins the only thing was the menu was a little lack luster the appetizer selection was fair. Hummus,tzatziki  , served w/flat bread ,selection of olives a couple of pork belly selections I had the lamb burger I ordered medium it was served a more rare but was still good the did offer some higher priced entrees and there were other selections of burgers and sandwiches thus the name gastro pub  they had some good beers on tap"
2,"After vine expressions closed many of us have tried this place.  I like new things and love different types of cuisine but this place doesnt hit the spot.  Its nice to go somewhere and get a wine list by the glass where you can choose a wine you enjoy but of course you want to know the freakin vineyard.  Not here.  By the glass, the list just has varietals - shiraz, cab, etc.  They change their list a lot but so do many places.  The food - below average.  Tried the stew that they said was great and famous.  Bland.  The sliders were like eating a salt lick, too salty.  The servers are nice but they tend to ramble on and give you a 15 minute dissertation on the menu and why you shouldnt look at the last page because its not available yet but they want you to know its there.  Finally, a few people mentioned the sucky chairs.  Boy, they werent kidding.  They have many stools at tables with no back.  Customers should be comfortable, this is not.  The seats with backs have as much padding as a 2X4.  Bottomline, uncomfortable. You want better options, here you go.  The living room in Chandler, my wine cellar in Ahwatukee, postino in Arcadia, 5th and wine in Old Towne, kazimierz in Old Towne, and terroir wine pub in N Scottsdale.  Been to all of them and all significantly better.    Tons more on Yelp. Postino is supposedly opening where grainbelt used to be across from Joes BBQ in downtown Gilbert so when thats there a local joint should be available."
5,"The single best ribs Ive ever had at any restaurant.  This place is brand new and off to a great start.  The mac and cheese was delicious, the bone marrow was great (as usual) and the staff and chef were friendly and helpful.  Ill be back here!"
1,"I went here because all my friends were peeing their pants about how good it is. Wrong.  The slow (perhaps retarted) staff with no customer service, alongside the barely mediocre tasting pizza both contributed to my disdain for this awful eatery. Fuck it...stick to Slices."
3,"Oh, Sushi Brokers...what happened to you?! This used to be my go-to place for great ambience and delish sushi.  We ate there Friday night for the first time in a long time and they have significantly raised their prices and the sushi was subpar at best! $90 for 3 rolls and 3 cocktails. Grrrr....frustrating!"
4,A few co-workers and I were in town for a conference and decided to check out this place on a Tuesday for lunch.  Service was fast and the sandwiches were good.  The bread was fresh...I would suggest splitting because a whole sandwich is just too much for a regular appetite.
5,"Fantastic place!  we went tonight for my friends birthday-they were able to seat 15 of us without a problem.  Our waiter, Tim, was fantastic-he split the checks for everyone before we even asked.  They gave the birthday girl two pieces of delicious dessert on the house.  The food was great-we were all surprised by how large the portions were for the price.  Everyone was very polite and accommodating I look forward to going back!"
3,"Yes, I can agree it is not perfect, but at least they are trying to do something different.  I didnt eat there and since I was a designated driver I only had soda.  I really enjoyed the stand up.  It is a great place to see some local performers start their career."
4,"Ive tried 4-5 different reflexology places in the East Valley as well as numerous professional massage places (like Massage Envy which is much pricier and kind of hit and miss) and Relax Station is the place Im sticking with. (See ya later Massage Envy!) It looks unimpressive from the outside, but I like that it is very clean and unsketchy, and they have private rooms (some reflexology places Ive been to put you in a huge room with like 10 other people which feels a little strange). Theyve always done a great job, and the price is reasonable (30$/hour) compared to other places in the area (cheapest Ive found is 28$ at other places with a coupon). They also give you a full bottle of water when you finish. They also take walk-ins or reservations, and Ive never had trouble getting in when I want to. Relax Station has definitely become MY massage place, I usually end up going every 3 or 4 weeks."
3,"A little disappointed...  We have been waiting for the right moment to visit this place and today turned out to be that day.  First of all, the location is in the middle of what looks to be a ghost town.  The interior had a lot of character with items like the family owned John Deer tractor ;)  Anyway, we had the full slab with 2 sides, a bottle of ginger beer and a drink.  Honestly, I expected more from this place.  The meat was dry, bland and over done.  My bf and I both agreed that our fav in Arizona is still Famous Daves where pay pretty much the same price, get to sit and relax while they serve you, and the food is better.   *Location = kinda out there *Price = for a cafeteria style bbq....I think its a little much *Food = its not all that...at least to us *Decor = very classic and full of character *** I just received a really nice message from the owner, Joe.  I think its wonderful that Joe cares about each customers comments and reviews.  Even though my review was not a very positive one, Joe was polite and very kind.  Thank you Joe and I think Im definitely gonna persuade my bf to try your restaurant again :)***"
1,"beware of the hidden  65 cent surcharge per person for tea even if you dont drink tea?  really. The crazy thing is, im sure no one even notices the extra cost because who checks the bill? When I mentioned it to the cashier, she was stuttering and stammering and started to back pedal and said  ""oh, is this your 1st time?  we can remove it from the bill"" I said forget it, keep it. i usually tip 20-30% but ill just let them keep their meager 65 per charge.   yeah, really worth losing a customer for? my 4 year old daughter even gets the gratuitus tea party charge and she only drinks water. gone are the $2.15 per item flat rate (can you say bait and switch?) $2.35 PER so now theyre no different from the rest of the dim sum places. as sneaky as C-FOO trying to strong arm the 15% gratuity (which failed miserably and lost us and about 100 of our friends as customers) so in a down economy, youre supposed to raise your prices and sneak in stealthy surcharges? its the chinese way i guess back to china king for us.  sorry china king for being disloyal with having a brief and sordid affair with the palace. will you forgive us? haha"
3,"07/25/11 I have a new crush... and its Christophers Restaurants pizza!   Ive been holding onto a restaurant.com gift certificate Id purchased to use at Crush Lounge for a long time now and decided it was time to use it.  I arrived w/ high expectations, of both the ambience and the food, and I wasnt disappointed... much.  The service was a bit spotty at times- we were immediately greeted when we entered and were seated quickly, but the wait that came after water delivery was a bit long at a time when there were no other guests seated around us.  (Perhaps there were other guests seated elsewhere, but they werent seated at the lounge, at the food bar, nor outside... Indeed, it seemed like were were the only ones in the room, besides the cooks at the open kitchen area, the servers, and the bartenders.)  Bread was delivered, but we were each given only one one-inch slice of a baguette.  How strange, especially when the butter cup held enough butter to spread over a whole loaf!  Whatever...  Two of the three dinner specials were relayed to us, w/ the promise of coming back to tell me about the scallop dish, but when our server finally came back ten or so minutes later, he asked if we were ready to order, so I had to remind him about the scallop entree... What was in it, and how was it prepared, and how much?  Hmmm, maybe he was ready to go home... Came in w/ Mom, so we had to try the calamari.  I also chose the Duck confit, goat cheese, and fig pizza.  For dessert, we had the profiteroles.  I really liked the calamaris coating-- lightly battered and fried golden-brown.  My fave pieces of the squid are also my Moms fave, the tentacles, so these were soon finished.  At least half of the remaining pieces, the sliced bodies, were undercooked-- poor value for the $12 menu price tag (and I was charged $13 on the ticket).  The pizza* was TERRIFIC!  Loved the semolina thin crust, and the duck confit gave the entree a great smoky flavor-- I thought perhaps there were lardons included in this dish too, but all the smokiness came from the duck.  Mmmm.... The goat cheese was very creamy, and there were lovely chopped figs all over the place-- Id order this pizza again in a heartbeat!  The profiteroles were fantastic, as well.  Three sliced choux pastry rounds, filled w/ dark chocolate sorbet, vanilla, and chocolate ice cream, sat on a pretty display made of chocolate ganache and creme anglaise, whole blackberries and blueberries, and a sliced strawberry.  More ganache was poured over the top of one profiterole upon presentation.  I asked if I could have more ganache, and our server quickly obliged-- thank you!!  We loved the crisped flakiness of the pastry (so perfect!), and out of the three flavors, we liked the fudgy dark chocolate sorbet the most.  I tell you, if I couldve licked the plate clean, I would have.  :)  Excellent dessert-- I totally recommend! (*Pizza reheats well!  Still lovely in flavor and just as crispy as it was when it was first delivered.  Cant wait to go back and try the other varieties!  Happy hour UYE, anyone?)"
5,"Finally, a great place to get breakfast that isnt Dennys or iHop in Gilbert. Came here with my family and we just made it before the change in menus.  The griddle bread pudding was AMAZING! Probably the highlight of the meal. We also ordered the veggie sandwich, All-American breakfast (?), a slice of red velvet cake.   We have definitely found our go-to Breakfast joint when my sister and I, both come back to Gilbert to visit the Rents."
3,"I met up with a few ladies here for drinks a few weeks back at the suggestion of someone else. We didnt end up playing pool, just enjoyed our drinks at the bar before moving over to a table. We were definitely over dressed and probably out of place, but it was a chill place to let loose. Drinks were okay, food was nothing outstanding, prices were to be expected."
4,Fun place for breakfast.  Prices were reasonable and food was good.
4,"Surprisingly well organized displays for a location that regularly gets mauled by roving packs of shoppers.  Great sales and service, a pretty solid seasonal selection but not as comprehensive as some of the larger Anthropologies out there. The person who lays out the stuff at this store seems to space out the perfume bombs at a wider spacing so sensitive noses may be less battered by this store than some others in the Valley. The clearance racks are gold mines for sizes 8+. They occasionally have shoes, bags and swim items being sold at clearance there from in-store returns.   ( Ladies 0-6 can enjoy amazing clearance picks at the Val Vista and US-60 location! That location also has stock from previous seasons since it is so far out of the way of the typical Anthropologie shopper.)"
1,"Youll feel like you stepped in a time machine and landed in 1987.  The decor hasnt been updated in at least 20 years.  Looks like its falling apart.  The TVs are mostly 80s style TVs as well, although there are a couple flat screens as well.  This is where the trash hangs out, of all colors.  The pizza was greasy (which I like) but also chewy (which was gross).  The wings were drowned so much in sauce you couldnt find them.  Might as well get a glass of honey bbq sauce and drink it straight.  Service was interesting.  The guy that worked there was wearing capri pants and had a higher voice than my girlfriend.  The price wasnt bad- I think it was like $22 for a large pizza, wings and 2 sodas.  Id rather pay a little bit more and just go to Upper Crust pIzza down the street."
4,"Pupusas?? As a hardcore Mexican food enthusiast I was intrigued by the concept but barely able to figure out how this fascinating dish was pronounced.  I am proud to say that I am a HUGE fan of pupusas now.   Salvadoreno popped up in a search of mine to find a low-key, nice Sunday night place to relax and enjoy some food.  It definitely was worth the visit to an interesting part of Mesa. The restaurant is very similar to a lot of Mexican food restaurants anyone who has lived in Phoenix will be familiar with.  One room with several tables and a counter with interestingly-named dishes posted behind it.  The waitress was very friendly, but I will say that knowing a little Spanish helped.  My girlfriend and I both ordered the Pupusa combo platter, real risky based on other reviews - I know.  I went with Pollo and the revuelta mixed with pork, cheese and beans.  She had the chicken as well with carne asada.  This little dish is fantastic!  I think next time Ill just stick with getting two pupusas because I was extremely full and did NOT need to add rice and beans to the mix (although those were good too.) The only disappointment was the fact that Independence Day was on the TV in Spanish, but the volume was too far down to hear.  Id love to hear the voice-over actor for Will Smith busting out a ""Bienvenidos a Tierra, P***!"" On a more serious note, I look forward to heading back here as soon as possible.  Id love to try the Ceviche, as its on the Best of Phoenix list, and there are a few other dishes (think breakfast) that looked intriguing."
4,"I really wanted to have a Birthday cake for Zoeys 4th Birthday and The Bone Appetit Bakery did not disappoint.  With just 24 hour notice I was able to choose a bone shaped cake from one of 2 sizes, I chose the small (see pics) A very tasty Peanut Butter and Honey cake with cream cheese frosting. All natural human grade ingredients, no sugar, salt or additives, Zoey went nuts for it!  I also purchased her a cute little party hat to wear for her birthday (see pics) they even sell invitations if you are planning a big doggy bash! ;-)  Your dog would just Love it if you brought home a Birthday cake for them, or even some of the house made baked treats they sell here.  Go Now!"
2,"This was my first time visiting Tandoori Times.  After seeing it advertised on Groupon, I thought Id give it a try.  My friend and I decided to go for lunch to celebrate her birthday.  It was very busy, which was promising.  The waitress was on her second day working there and was unfamiliar with the menu, but she was friendly.   The house salad was mediocre, the entree (Algoo Gobi) was delicious, but the desserts were AWFUL.  The ""mango"" ice cream was a neon orange and tasted nothing like mango, or any flavor of ice cream Id ever tasted actually (kinda vanilla, kinda puke).  YUCK.  The rice pudding was not worth eating either.   The worst part of the experience was being followed out into the parking lot, after leaving the Groupon and cash tip, to be told that we needed to come speak with management about not ordering at least $40 worth of food!  Really?  I told the waiter that we had spent just over $30, and we obviously didnt expect any cash back from the $40 Groupon.  He said his manager was ""fussy"" and wouldnt like it.  I basically told him that was too damn bad, and that I wasnt ordering $10 more in food; I was actually kinda saving them $10!  He finally figured out what I was saying and left us alone.  I did end up calling the manager though, who was not pleased to hear about our experience with the dumb waiter.  I dont foresee returning there."
4,"Just had an early dinner with the kids tonight (kids eat free from 3-6pm btw).  I had the prime rib and my wife had the fish special, kids had the mac and cheese. All were great meals. The reason to go here is to sit on the patio, its fantastic!  Not impressed that at 5:30pm I had to valet, when Im with the family, Id just rather park and walk (needed to walk off the prime rib and wine anyways!).  This place is not cheap, and with $18 glasses of wine, there is no happy hour at the restaurant!"
5,"I am totally addicted to this place. Tons of flavors of smoothies, and perfectly cooked Boba. Green Tea, or even Vanilla Chi - so far all the flavors Ive tried have been fantastic."
4,Great lean pastrami and cole slaw. Marble rye and challah were a little bland and dry. I always appreciate diet Dr. Browns cream soda. Overall good lunch spot and handy location.
5,"The Thai menu is totally amazing!  I had the Panang; and the coconut curry was to die for.  I have been mistakenly driving past this wonderful place for a year.  Do yourself a favor, try Na Rai, you will be so pleased  you did.  They have a lunch menu as well."
4,"True Food Kitchen claims to not be a health-food restaurant, rather a place for great food that just so happens to be healthy. Whatever you want to call it, when you sit down, youll be handed a card explaining nutrition guru Dr. Andrew Weils food philosophies and explaining their ingredients and food items until you no longer have an appetite. However, give this place a chance - its not all about health at the sacrifice of flavor. The decor perfectly highlights the culinary concept, with clean, modern lines, big open windows, and LOTS of green. Andrews Elixir, one of their refresher drinks, was delightful. The best food item we had was the caramelized onion tart appetizer, with gorgonzola cheese, black figs, and caramelized onions on a crispy flat crust. It was the perfect balance of the sweet mild onions and sweet figs with savory cheese and light, crispy crust. Our server said this is the same crust as their pizzas, so next time Id like to try those. Next, we had the edamame dumplings, which is basically steamed won tons filled with pureed edamame in a light miso broth. These were good, not great. For our entree, we ordered the black cod, but we had to send it back because it was so fishy (and undercooked). When I asked the server if the fish is fresh or fresh-frozen, he said, ""Well, theyre all fresh-frozen."" Their fish entrees are $22, which seems inexpensive, but theyre fairly small portions. For that kind of price in this type of restaurant, I would expect fresh fish. Perhaps the fresh-frozen fish is a cost-cutting measure in what seems to be the increasingly corporate Sam Fox empire. We went with the salmon instead, which was also undercooked but far less fishy. The roasted apples and pureed celery root were lovely, but the dish as a whole was a little overpowered by the mustard sauce, and the accompanying vegetables were weird. Prices overall are very reasonable, especially if you stick with appetizers, salads, pizzas, and sandwiches. True Food aims for the lofty goal of making great cuisine that just so happens to be extremely healthy, and occasionally misses the mark, but I give them credit for bringing Dr. Andrew Weils philosophies on the importance of nutrition for the body and mind to the mainstream."
2,to make a long story short --- we had a coupon for this place.  We know its an ASU hang out but the coupon was for spend 50.00 get 25.00 off.  Ok service was not good --- when we got the bill the pizza and wings were charged separate -- not right -- it was a together order per the menu.  We had a pitcher of beer and a single beer plus food -- bill was almost 70.00 -- we gave the waitress the coupon -- she had to change the bill for the pizza and wings --- then she came back and stated the coupon had a 18% gratuity and service charge of 13.59.  Based on what ???  that actually ate up the coupon and we ended up paying full price anyway.  Never again --- and the food was fair --- not a good place to return to -- ASU take it away -- its all yours -----
4,"This place was real chill last night. I had been to the one in Downtown Phoenix quite a few times before and wasnt all to impressed, but this location is a whole nother animal. Plenty of space to do you. Something so rare in cramped up tiny Scottsdale. Crowd was alright and the bartenders were super nice. Might have to swing through the next time I hit up Scottsdale."
4,"I will tell you exactly why this place is so great. This place will blow your mind.  Not only is the service good, but the food is amazing.   Here is the rub, your friends are drunk and they start babbling on about wanting to go to some Mexican food restaurant that inevitably ends in the letters ____bertos.  It does not matter which, they all are basically the same.  You go and get your gut injected with evil and then are forced to deal with that for 10-12 hours. Talk about regret. Dont do it.  Like a child of abuse, you have the power to stop the cycle. Say ""Nah"" Like the famous sunglasses kid, ""Lets go to Mi Patio and have some fantastic food, amazing service, and keep drinking to boot.""  You will be a hero. You will make Ironman look like AquaMan (Hes a Chump.  ""You sir, command that fish into this taco."").  Short list of amazing things to be had here: 1. Margaritas. 2. Mi Patio Taco. Not a taco and not a burrito. What is it? 3. The Chips and Salsa  4. Chicken Tacos.   5.  Ice Tea.  6. Pacifico"
5,"After writing the review the other day I had a taste for Pappas. So I went last night and YA-HUMMEE! I tried something new the Hudson platter and this baby did not disappoint! Perfectly grilled scallops, 2 succulent and sweet lobster tails, 4 huge shrimp brochette. If you are not familiar with shrimp brochette it is shrimp stuffed with Monterey jack cheese and a sliver of Jalapeno, wrapped in bacon and char -grilled. DELICIOUSNESS! It is served with the fabulous dirty rice and sauteed green beans all for are you ready for this wait for it 22.95!  I also indulged in sharing a little pecan sweet potato pie with Hagen daas vanilla ice cream and bourbon sauce. WOOHOO! FYI all deserts purchased until July 26th will have a portion of the proceeds go to a local food bank!  Dinner last night was sooo freakin good I may be back tonight! Bon Appetite"
5,"The Culinary Dropout , you get the best of both worlds. The food is off the hook (its great) ,the service, these ladies and guys take care of your every need, and as a added bonus you have some of the best performers in Phoenix, entertaining you while you dinne.....Check it out....Bluesman Mike"
5,"Incredibly good calzones; friendly service, nice courtyard seating."
3,"We were visiting again, so of course that means at least 2 trips to Sugar Bowl!  The food, service and ice cream were good as always, but WOW, the prices sure have gone up.  I know that the economy sucks, but for what we got, the prices just dont seem to justify it.  We had different waitresses both times.  The fist was efficient but not very warm.  We had Sandra on our second visit - and YES, she remembered us again!  Could not believe it.  She is very friendly and can really keep up when they get swamped.  We will be back, but maybe only once per visit instead of 2 (or 3 or 4) times.  Just cant afford those prices for what you get."
3,"I would give this place 3.5 stars.  The service was excellent and the view of Pheonix at sunset was nice.  I ate the wedge salad (nothing special) and the chorizo mac and cheese (yummy).  The highlight for me was the pudding trio, the honey date flan was delicious but the portion was small...which led me to savor every bite.  The other people in my party were satisfied with their food and there were no complaints."
4,"I loved this place.  It was a little pricey but all the stuff in it had some kind of paperwork.  The paperwork explained about the materials used. I thought the lady who worked there was nice.  Dont skip go in---even if you dont buy you can soak up a little astmosphere,"
3,"They are known for their CARNE ASASDA and it  does rock but dang this place was nickle and diming me at every turn!   Everything is ala carte, and the tacos are so small,3 bites and its done. For the price tag it should at least come with a small bag of chips. Honestly the chips were so average it was disappointing. the salsa that comes with it was mediocre considering the hold out factor applied.   The salsa that came with my  tacos was exceptional, that should be their signature salsa for everything. Sodas by the can, no refills,,geezzz,, another 3.00 bucks later. I think I ended up spending over $12 for 3 small tacos and small basket of chips, and 2 sodas in z can.  For that price,  I want more atmosphere or at least a 4 bite taco."
4,"I was pleasantly surprised to find the Phoenix Public Market across the parking deck from the Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication. Its too bad its not located on the ground floor of the school, replacing the space currently occupied by Subway. It would be much healthier for the students. I had their breakfast protein shake, which was AWESOME! Even though it was $6, I ended up having TWO! While the shop is not as big as a Whole Foods, it does provide the organic and healthy staples, while serving fresh salads, pastries, and different types of chocolates. I didnt get to purchase the local bran of organic ice cream, which seems to be popular. Maybe next time Im back in Phoenix. I also liked their little coffee shop in the back room, which is separate from the main shopping area, giving you a bit of quiet to read a book or check your email. Lastly, all the staff are quirky, yet incredibly friendly. They offered up suggestions for local things to do, and were generally helpful. Overall, love this place. I wish it a long and successful life. The world needs more Phoenix Urban Markets."
3,"Its not in a shell gas station anymore and i guarantee that Guy would never visit the new location on his show. I ordered the El Pastor burrito and i didnt like it at all, very dry and just not to my liking. I would never order it again but Im sure there are alot of people out there that like it. The salsa was great and i couldnt get enough of it. I ate half of a bean and cheese burrito and i really liked that also, not the greatest tortillas ever but they are possibly #3. I would could back and id like to try some other type of burrito or some carne asada tacos."
4,"The drive to the top is really fun, and the view is worth it. I really enjoyed it here, but theres too much freakin broken glass on any of the trails down near the main shade/view structure that you should realy avoid it if you have your dogs with you and stick to the more wilderness areas. 30 other reviews = TLDR (i just learned that one, see how Im applying) so Id rather be brief and useful than wordy and redundant. I did read Chuck Rs review, and I have to say, I wish I knew more of the nooks and crannys that you do, but I can tell you that if you want to explore the Western reaches of the park, do so by starting in the center or east, and not to bother with approaching from the West side of the mountain range itself.  All youll find out there is a bunch of paranoid, possesive property owners who didnt stop to think that if they chose to own a home on a ribbon of private land that surrounds public land and restricts the public from getting to their public land, then theyll have to endure a little bit of traffic from said public.  Heres a clue for any of those property owners, whether youre on South Mountain, Piestewa, wherever....the guy sneaking around is the one you call the cops on for being a suspicious trespasser, not the guy driving a family suv with 2 dogs in the back, who calls you from the street as he sees you in your driveway so he can ask directions on how to get to the park entrance so he doesnt have to bother you nice people in the residential neighborhood anymore driving around here.    ah, duh."
5,"Great Pizza. Great Service. Weve been here a few times since it opened. And always look forward to going. We have never had a bad experience. Each time has been great. Our waiter Dave was perfect, always on the ball."
2,"This is one of those reviews where a qualifier is required.  It seems like everybody that gives this transit system a good rating is a Phoenix native.  That makes this, like so many other things, good for Phoenix.  The problem is that its terrible compared to nearly every other metro system in North America and absolutely abysmal compared to more progressive parts of the world. This is quite possible the slowest train that I have ever ridden in my life.  It seems to make stops every two blocks and it take far too long to get anywhere.  Factor in the terrible hours of operation and youre going to easily find yourself stranded at one end or the other after a night at the bar. Please work on expanding the routes and hours, speeding up the trains and then maybe youll be able to increase ridership.  Im a huge fan of mass transit but this train falls far short of expectations."
3,"Came for a friends birthday and really was not that impressed. First of all, it took us a while to find parking as this place only has street parking and a few spots in back. On Saturday if you are there before 7pm, all alcohol was 1/2 off and some appetizers were on special. We ate dinner there and the menu was very limited. The food was okay, but our burgers were over cooked. The service was slow and it took us a while to get our check. Id go to hang out again and have a few drinks, but I wouldnt suggest making this your regular hang out."
2,"Five Guys is great for those days when you want to spend $12 on a glorified fast-food hamburger. The meat comes in a wafer-thin patty, and doesnt really taste like anything, just like at Wendys. The bun tastes mass-produced.  I also dont especially care for their fries, although this is a matter of taste more than anything. Im not generally one for mushy, thick, ""natural"" fries of the sort served here.  I cant help but wonder if people rate this place purely on the quantity of food that you get. The normal size for the burger is a double-patty, and the fries come overflowing from a 12 oz. drink cup.  I would rank the burger places around mill as: 1) Smashburger, for their delicious Arizona burger, and the awesome smash fries 2) Chuckbox, for delicious char-grilled meat that actually tastes like meat 3) In-n-out, for great-tasting meat and some of my favorite fries 4) Five Guys, 5) Fatburger, seriously why the fuck does anyone eat at Fatburger?"
2,The buns fall apart so you end up eating your burger with a soggy bun.  Staff does not seem to know what is going on and they are not well trained.  Cant think on their own.
4,"I go here for the free wifi and the bleu cheese crumble salad. Thats it. Bleu cheese, craisins, sunflower seeds all on a bed of romaine. LOVE IT. I dont think Ive ever had anything else on the menu, now that I think about it. Free wifi will get me in every time, thats for sure! I chose this location because I was in Phoenix in-between activities, and didnt want to drive back to Gilbert. This was at the Biltmore, and yeah, you knew you were in a Paradise Bakery at the Biltmore. Kind of funny actually. What can I say? I like to people-watch. :-)"
3,Pretty decent food. Friendliness of staff is hit or miss.
4,"Go Go here for happy hour! From 4-7pm you can delight in their half priced apps and specialty cocktails. Their sushi rolls are meh, but their teriyaki ribs are falling off the bone, finger lickin good! The cocktails seem to be concocted for little Asian girls (which is odd since there are no Asian girls in Scottsdale, especially now that my BFF and I are gone) - fruity with cutesy names like ""Hello Kitty,"" ""Harajuku Lover,"" ""Shiso Horny,"" and ""Kinki Kooler"" just to name a few. My favorite was the ""Turning Japanese"" which was like biting into a vodka infused pear. Service at the bar was wonderful - Victoria is the one of the cutest bartenders in Old Town (guys, go pay her a visit). Drinks were flowing and the food came out quickly. In addition to the happy hour and Victoria, make sure you check out their restrooms and private karaoke rooms, complete with ""entertainment"" poles. If you end up spending a long time on their Toto toilets, people will understand why. Seat warmer and a bidet? Youll want to take your business there on a daily basis."
5,"dr. matsumoto and her team are the best!  she came recommended to me by a friend who also goes there.  they truly care about the WHOLE child and not just their medical care.  we have seen 3 of the pediatricians in the office and they have all been great.  we developed a special bond with Dr. Miller during a very lengthy health issue with my son.  its a 45 minute drive for us now that weve moved, but we still make the drive  to see dr.  miller because we  trust her to make the right decisions and offer the best advice for my childs health."
5,"This place is awesome. Affordable, tasty food.  Simple and clean country environment."
4,"When one course of a meal is so significantly better than the rest of it, its hard to write a balanced review.  I went down to Cheuvront with a few friends for Restaurant Week.  The place is tiny, very relaxed-hip looking, and right on Central Ave.  While the place doesnt have any distinct look or theme going on, there was a movie with french subtitles playing on a screen next to the dining area so...I guess its supposed to be French.  They have wine and cheese too, so, yeah, probably French. So the meal didnt start out so great.  The spinach salad came out to me on a dirty place.  Sure, its a restaurant.  I know other people use the same plates and silverware Im using, but things like that, especially when noticed, are off-putting.  Unfortunately, the ahi tuna that followed was also overdone.  Not in a bad way, and I almost didnt notice through the thick peppercorn crusting, but when it was pointed out, I was a little disappointed. That was when they pulled out dessert. Im not a sweets person.  I dont know that Ive ever been.  Give me spicy or savory 10 times out of 10 over any kind of sweet-tasting anything.  Although my dentist might argue evidence to the contrary, I really just dont have a sweet tooth.  That being said, I wanted to die and be entombed in the citrus flan that was put in front of me.  I wanted to lick the plate clean and then go back to the kitchen and demand they fill my pockets, one with the smooth, creamy, more-like-custard-than-flan flan and the other with the wonderfully sweet and subtle citrus sauce they coated the dish with.  Id also probably ask for some of the figs and berries to be put in a doggie bag. I have never, in my entire life, enjoyed a dessert as much as this one.  I would happily drive the 20-plus minutes downtown just to have this again. Before I forget or the keyboard shorts out from me drooling, the wine selection here is also amazing.  I didnt take time to look at the whole thing, but I think most wine connoisseurs would be happy here. While it was a mixed bag, the place certainly deserves another trip.  I can see (if I had a real life, not one that consisted solely of studying) sitting out on their patio, enjoying Phoenix, and making a dent in their wine and cheese stocks."
5,I have been eating at this Waffle house since I was a teenager and it has never failed to provide good food.  The employees are courteous and the service is fast.  The portions are good for the price and the small dinner feel is great to eat in.  I have gone here many times with my disabled brother and have never had any problems with the staff or employees.  I also like the fact that they are one of the few 24 hr restaurants available to eat at and this has come in handy many times.
5,"We stopped here on a Thursday night on a raving referral and they we not exaggerating - this place is fantastic! We are always a little hesitant to try a new place when an omnivore suggests it, but as vegetarians, we found Sekong by Night so accommodating! They offered to convert nearly any dish on their menu into a vegan alternative, and it was delicious. The spring rolls are really big, and they swapped their fish dipping sauce for a vegan version. We had the Phnom Penh Noodle Soup with tofu & veggie broth (just like the Vietnamese pho!) and the Katheaw Cha rice noodles with tofu instead of beef - AMAZING.  Service was top notch, and as many other reviewers noted their prices are unbelievably low for the quantity and quality of food that you get. Looking forward to our next visit and trying more fantastic dishes!"
3,"Ruby Tuesdays salad bar and healthier choices (With caloric count for calorie counters) for entrees is what sets it apart from other chain restaurants that serve your basic American style cuisine.  The salad bar includes 2 types of base greens (Iceberg and mixed greens), with various toppings (Edamame, peas, mushrooms, croutons etc.) and dressings (Italian, low fat balsamic, ranch, thousand island, etc).   Generally, with any main entree, you will have your choice of side and salad bar, or 2 sides.  They also have more healthy side options such as roasted spaghetti squash and steamed broccoli.  My husband had the chicken trio, and I had the creole fish on our visit.  The chicken was nicely presented, and was fairly tender and juicy.  Of the three different toppings (Balsamic and tomato, mushroom cheese, and mango salsa), my least favorite was the mango salsa since the mango in it, while fresh, wasnt totally ripe.  The creole fish was presented in a Spartan way, with just one piece of fish with a mound of side next to it on a plain white plate.  The fish (Some type of white fish, maybe carp?) was a freshwater white-flesh fish and had a decent seasoning and was cooked well.  Service was friendly, but we did not have any silverware on our table when we were seated and had to ask for it after our entrees were served to us.  Drinks were refilled quickly as needed. I havent indulged in a lot of the desserts, but I am a fan of the Italian creme cake.  Its moist, and not too sweet.   Prices are moderate, and entrees will be around 15 dollars, give or take a few dollars."
3,"I remember when this place first opened.  I was very excited since it seemed so ""humbling"". I came here for lunch and thought this place actually looks ""okay"" at best.  Chicken Sandwich was excellent.  The bread was toasty and crunchy, while the Chicken and toppings were warm and buttery!  However, the soup can improve.  They only gave to you 2 options so I guess I had a 50/50 chance of getting the good one!   The place was loud and popping!  Not sure what to make of it since they had wine racks and wine, but then teeny hot pink tank tops hanging from the wines.  Is this supposed to make me want to drink more wine or should I buy a shirt for my GF?  Though I dont think anyone would appreciate a shirt that says PIE.   Service was good, I guess.  Our waiter was very nice and helpful, but he seemed flustered with a smile.  He didnt do anything wrong by any means except he was going about 100 more miles than I was.  - Enjoy"
2,"Its ok, quality . Service was below par, although they were really busy. Fries were good and endless I guess thats good.. But, I was looking for a good burger, too bad I didnt find it here."
4,"I seriously love this store. I wish I didnt live so close because I always find myself here without even realizing it.  I can always find something here that is awesome. I pretty much never leave empty-handed. They have some really great deals and prices on clothes, shoes, accesories and purses. Their high end stuff is still kind of ridiculous though. But that could just be my broke-ass opinion."
5,"I LOVE this place..  This is my sushi bar.  Danny, one of the two sushi chefs is awesome.  I have always found their sushi to be very fresh. About a year ago they came out with a special sushi menu.  With rolls like these: Dirty Harry, Mr. Miagi, Rio, you cannot go wrong.  Especially if you like spicy (like me)! Even the non-sushi is great.  This is one place my 6 year old loves that doesnt have a drive through window. Also, $4.50 sake bombs!!!  $4.50! Go here.  Try it.  Dont be scared off by a couple of so-so (ok, 1 bad) reviews.  I am looking to even have a UYE here in the near future!  Should be getting a call tomorrow to get it scheduled. Almost forgot!  They have some big screen TVs!  Watch sports here!  They are hugely popular for UFC fights and football..   Just go.  Now..  Seriously.  Review part is over..  You are wasting time reading the fodder I have written here.  You could be finding your keys..  Putting on socks and shoes..  Hell, skip the socks..  Wear sandals.  Save time."
3,"Harkins 16 is exactly like every other Harkins theater.  That it to say, a huge, context-less concrete box in the middle of the desert that shows the same movies as their competitors.  I saw the Simpsons movie here tonight and just have a few thoughts to share. -The Cine Capri screen is big.  Anyone who has visited either the Scottsdale location or now-defunct Camelback relic knows this, but I felt it was worth repeating.  Very cool to see a movie on a screen larger than life itself. -There is always ""that guy"" in the theater.  You know, the one that laughs as loud as a bullhorn, repeats everything that happens on-screen, and occasionally yells out something profane or derogatory.  Now, imagine a theater where every guy is ""that guy.""  If it werent for the cool factor of the huge screen and seeing a movie Ive been waiting to see since childhood, I would have walked out in annoyance.  Seriously, what compels people to behave like this?  I dont know if this is due to the proximity to ASU (beefneck central), but it sucked. -Previously mentioned by another reviewer, but Dippin Dots are awesome.  Simply awesome. Getting out of the parking lot was a disaster.  I dont know if the whole Tempe Marketplace complex could be more poorly designed."
2,"Dropped by for a manicure, and as soon as I sat down, my manicurist started talking in rapid Vietnamese. I couldnt see her headset so I thought she was speaking to me, but obviously she wasnt. In fact, she never looked at me during the lightning fast manicure, except in confusion when I said I didnt want her to cut my cuticles -- just push them back. She really didnt understand that, and asked me in broken English why I was getting a manicure but not getting my cuticles cut. She didnt have an attitude about it, but was just really confused. I think after that exchange, she told whoever was on her phone about it. I also thought it was strange that she asked me to wash my hands after giving me a lotioned hand massage -- sort of defeats the purpose of applying lotion to my hands in the first place?  The whole experience was perfunctory, but didnt leave me wanting to return for a manicure. Not asking for a great nail technician, but it would have been nice if she acknowledged my existence other than doing my nails, and most importantly if she asked whether I wanted them cut round or square because I wanted them round!  I would have interrupted her phone conversation to let her know my preference, but she was so fast to dunk my hands back into the soaking dish that I didnt see what they looked like!"
5,"i love this place. very rarely do i get to go out and tie one on. when i do, this is were i want to be at some point in the night. where else can i go and request the cramps? i...love...this...place, it makes me happy. i suppose i should go on and on about what its like, but i wont. go and experience it for yourself."
5,"This is our favorite breakfast place. The food is good. They have the best biscuits & gravy of any restaurant I have eaten at. The wait staff is friendly. The only complaint I have is that Sunday mornings are packed, so there can be a wait to be seated."
1,"I will be moving to Phoenix in the Winter and I thought Id scout out some LFS while I was visiting, which led me to Reef Culture. At first I was positive seeing some nice looking displays and LED use, however this soon changed.  On closer inspection, lots of the tanks were infested with aiptasia and bubble algae, and prices of coral were hugely inflated compared to other prices in the area and back home. The people were very unprofessional and unfriendly and first ignored me entirely despite trying to flag someone down. When I did manage to get their attention, I was belittled and treated like a child who knew nothing about the hobby (I have had marine tanks for over a decade ranging from large 55 gallon+ to tiny DIY LED picos).  After this rude and demeaning experience, I continued to peruse the last few tanks and came across an angler fish. I watched him and he followed me as I walked down the isle as far as his tank would go and I backtracked a couple steps, amused that he was slowly walking along the tank with me. There was a loud crack as the man behind the counter slammed the phone down, snapped his fingers at me, and told me to ""stop harassing the fish."" Keep in mind, I was not tapping on glass or prodding anything as I am quite short and I could barely reach to the high up tank where the angler fish was, much less reach to ""harass"" any fish. After this rude treatment I promptly left. This kind of unprofessional treatment of the customers is shocking and unacceptable, not to mention the bubble algae infested tanks (one spore of that on the water that you get your coral in and your tank is infected too).  I wont be doing business here when I move."
1,"After bad experience, I will never return.  It is terrible since they didnt meet my expectation and the price is outrageous.  The most difficult part of the Pho is the broth (req 16 hours of preparation) and it tasted like water.  I had to add all kind of condiments to rescue it but cant even eat it.  The restaurant is very slow now and it confirmed what I meant with Asian restaurant.  If your fellow Asians dont patronize the place, it is  because your food did not meet our expectation.  Try across the street to the Rice plate Kim Thanh for their rice dish.  It is night and day."
1,"MY EXPECTATIONS WERE EXCEEDED!  Ive been searching for so long to have a dinner experience that MET all of my expectations - for a restaurant that I SHOULD NEVER PATRONIZE.  Mimis in Goodyear actually exceeded my expectations.  On Oct 26th, while visiting the area, I made the unfortunate mistake of recommending we dine at Mimis because of previously good food and service there.  But, alas, if the old Mimis quality still existed, they wouldnt have exceeded my expectations for WHAT NOT to experience in a restaurant. Let me recant why YOU or ANY ONE ELSE (except those people you truly dislike) should never patronize this facility.  First of all, the interior temperature was at least 80 degrees (when it was less than 65 outside).  We had to ask for the air conditioning to be turned on. Next, we ordered the artichoke dip appetizer.  It looked funny.  It tasted funny.  The tortilla chips actually resembled pita chips.  If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it must be a ______. I ordered the chicken cordon bleu which is supposed to be served with ""seasonal vegetables"" and ""homemade mashed potatoes"".  Can someone explain to me how MIXED seasonal vegetables can be served where the brocolli is steaming hot, but the carrots mixed with them are literally still frozen in the middle?  Thats a feat.  My ""homemade"" mashed potatoes?  Cold.  A sliver of butter placed on top of the mashed potatoes would not even melt to graphically show our waitress ""the problem"" .  Even after this effort, no offer from the wait staff (or manager-missing-in-action) was ever made to either warm up the potatoes, replace them ......or, perhaps, use them as wall spackling. After all this, they sincerely asked us if ""everything was all right"" and ""would we care to order dessert"".  At least they have a sense of humor. Never again."
5,"Roka Akor has a classy atmosphere, and a slightly formidable menu to pick from. Everything looks so good, and in a new environment, I want to try it all! But my date and I, after much deliberation, decided to ""go for broke"", as it were and if we couldnt finish, at least we had a good sample of the menu.   For an appetizer, we got the butterfish tataki and the burnt red tomato salad. These were yummy little tidbits that disappeared off the plate quickly. The butterfish was delicate, and the salad was great - the greens had all sorts of different flavors, and not that ""generic clump of lettuce"" flavor I hate.  From the sushi menu, I was feeling adventurous and had never had raw red meat before, so I ordered the wagyu gunkan. My date saw the amount of green onions piled on top of this dish and oh-so-chivalrously gave me his piece. Its true that you needed a healthy appreciation of green onion to like these as served. The wagyu beef is ground nearly to a puree - which I wasnt expecting, and I thought the onion was a bit much.  At for the skewers we ordered, my date liked his sweet potatoes the best, but I was partial to the crispy BBQ. These turned out to be two large ovoid and solid shapes of rice, run through with a skewer. Pure white sushi rice in the center, the outside was caramelized with what tasted like the sweet BBQ sauce that comes on eel sushi, which gave the whole thing a nice, crispy shell.  At this point, I got to what I consider to be the crowning achievement of the meal: the yuzu marinated black cod. The cod, cooked on the robata grill in a leaf, was meltingly soft and delicately flavored. It was an effort to be share fairly. I believe my date said after our first taste of it, ""Just eat what you want and Ill finish ..."",  I looked up from my chopsticks, ""... you know what? Just cut me off half.""  I wasnt sure that I could handle dessert after eating so much, but we finally decided it wouldnt be fair not to give the dessert menu a looking over, right? So we ordered the baked green tea custard, and it was a perfect pick after a gut-busting meal. Light and airy, it also had some carbonation to it that tickled my taste buds and made me giggle a lot as I was eating it.   Our sampler of shochu ranged from impressive to harsh, at least to my taste buds. In order starting with least harsh: pineapple, honeycomb, raspberry, and apple. I didnt like the last two, but the pineapple was, in my mind, a fairly dangerous thing to drink when youre not paying attention. Smooth.  Thats it for the food, and as for the service, it was swift and considerate; glasses were kept full, and empty plates whisked away. There was, however, one glaring exception that nearly overpowered the entire evening with its oddness. The waiter, who had up till this point been very nice and chatty, helpful about menu items, and generally a pretty cool guy, handed me his phone number and told us to call him any time we wanted to go partying.   What am I supposed to do with this? Are we going to call our waiter up and say ... well, what? It flummoxed me."
3,"The food here is good. Its not outstanding, or anything to write home about, but it IS tasty.   The whole making a tortilla in front of your eyes seems a little kitch-y to me, but so what? Everyone has to have a marketing ploy. Ive eaten in, and taken out, and the burrito quality is about the same.  Personally, I like Chipotle better, as I like the dressing on their veggie salad. My one beef (amusing, since I only get the beans) is that they were a little too light handed with everything. I got hardly any guacamole or sour cream, and that is really what helps to make a delicious tasty burrito of goodness in my eyes. Will I go back? Certainly, if its on my way and Im hungry. Will I choose to seek it out? Probably not."
5,R.T. OSullivans really hit the spot! The service and the atmosphere were outstanding. We were put into the back room which was perfect for our large group of 45 plus. The server kept track of everything even as people moved around and socialized. The food was wonderful.  We will be going back!
1,"I was so happy to see another station in the neighborhood.  I went in to fill up as I usually do at any station unaware that I was paying TEN CENTS MORE PER GALLON (than Circle K)  because I wasnt paying cash or using a Shell credit card.  Yes, there are signs on the pump but, really, who would think to look for such a requirement?  Ive been buying gas for over 40years and have never seen such a non-cash penalty.  I, and my children, their spouses and our friends will not be getting gas there ever again.  How disappointing and dishonest."
5,"Super friendly. Joe was there greeting everyone, refilling coffee, and sharing how we uses local Arizona suppliers. Great diner food and decor. Loved the biscuits and chorizo gravy.  Will definitely be back."
5,"Im giving Bobby Q an extra star in this update to my previous review, because although it has its share of hits and misses, it is, in fact, as good as it gets in Phoenix for great barbecue. I love barbecue. It is a hobby of mine. When I get stuck on something and want to know what it should look and taste like, I go to Bobby Q and am almost never disappointed. Most recently, this happened with beef brisket. Im going to upload a picture I took of Bobby Qs brisket because seriously, if you look at it and dont want to immediately die from desire, then you just dont like barbecue. If I had anything bad at all to say about Bobby Q, it would be that sometimes their meats can be slightly overdone but this is not the norm. Their quality control, considering how much food they must serve to keep up with the demand, is astounding.  Their prices are too high, but of course, youre paying for the almost Disney-esque atmosphere. Their sauce is absolutely delicious (although it should be noted: they dont understand what ""spicy"" means). All in all I really cant say enough good things about this place. Go look at my brisket photo. Seriously."
5,"I was in Bomberos for breakfast this morning, and I was told they now carry Coca Lite!  So much better than Diet Coke - I had no idea I could find it anywhere in the US!  How great is that? Also, Bomberos is now using MJ Breads and Tammie Co pastries... not too shabby, huh?"
1,"Great at first, then the bartender ignored me and my friends for a good 20-30 minutes, put everyones bill on my tab. I opened a tab so this wouldnt happen then they made us wait another 15 for them just to ask us who had what. Then they over charged us by quit a bit. We had to flag someone f=down from napkins and plates and it took a few trys for a water. And to make matters worse my friend got a parking ticket because they took so long. There were three bartenders for what I handle myself at a bar on a daily basis. No sorry from any of them and not even a drip of regret from the manager. He pretty much told us to chill out after this whole 45 min waiting or deal, just to close a check. Kind of a joke really."
2,"The new Frys in the burbs are awesome, but this old relic is pretty bad. Ugly with a with a smaller selection, plus staff who pass you in the aisles (when youre obviously looking for something) without asking if they can help. If youre in this neighborhood, head over to the nearby Safeway."
2,I really wasnt impressed with the service or the food.
5,"This was my first experience with Lush (with many more to follow).  I stumbled into the store because I could smell it 4 stores down, and I was drawn in by the aroma (I dont even thing I read the name on the sign...I just followed my nose).  I had never seen anything like it!  The giant blocks of soap, the colorful bath-bombs, the bubble bars (that looked like little cakes), and so much more!  It was late December, so the sales staff told me that any left-over Christmas items were buy 1 get 2 free (what a deal on my first visit!).  They demonstrated a bath bomb for me, and I was MESMERIZED!  I got 6 Christmas bath bombs (4 of them for free!) and 3 travel-sized Snow Fairy shower gels (another Christmas product, and by far one of my favorite Lush products EVER).  I also got some non-holiday bath bombs and melts because they were just too heavenly to pass up (I got a Youki Hi bath bomb, my favorite bath bomb ever, which was sadly discontinued sometime last year).  I also got my first piece of Lush soap (Sexy Peel. all the citrus just makes me smile when I use this soap. Its sunshine in your shower) Since I used to work in the mall I would go into Lush whenever I had a break and get a couple things, and the staff always recognized me :) They even offered me a hand-cream sample one day when I was complaining of dry hands.  I brought some of my friends from school in and told the girl behind the counter that they were newbies, so she rushed out from behind the counter to demonstrate EVERYTHING in the store!  Literally, she showed us bath bombs, bubble bars, face cleansers and toners, massage bars, and dusting powders.  I was so impressed by her powder demo that I bought some Candy Fluff dusting powder (another item that has since been discontinued.  Vanilla Puff powder is a nice substitute). This store holds a special place in my heart because it was the first Lush store I ever went to, and I will forever have fond memories of the staff that dazzled me, and every time I smell Sexy Peel Soap or SnowFairy Shower Gel I am reminded of that magical day :)"
4,"We were exceptionally sun deprived by the time March came around, so that may have swayed my review to be exceptionally sunny.  I was pleasantly surprised by the FLW inspired architecture (I didnt do any research on the hotel-my husband picked it) and by the beautiful grounds. Our room was very comfortable but we spent the majority of our time at the pool or on the  patio relaxing.  It is definitely not 5 star service across the board, but no one was rude. Our room wasnt cleaned the entire 3 days we were there, even after we asked the front desk to send housekeeping. That didnt get us down--after all, we didnt come there to hang out in our room. At Frank and Alberts, the staff gladly switched the TV to the game we wanted to watch and the food was great."
5,"Any time I have out of town visitors who want ""real"" Mexican, I take them here. The chips are fresh, the salsa is divine, and after downing two baskets, you realize you need to eat an entree! Ive eaten a variety off the menu, and nothing has disappointed me. The burros are stuffed full, the crisps are mouthwatering and the enchiladas melt in your mouth. The ONLY downside is the location. Just not a great part of town, though they are trying very hard to revitalize it. Go there anyway! Just try lunch time first."
5,"Zin, zin, zin - Yes, yes, yes! Several weeks ago five of us had a wonderful Monday evening at Zinburger with our delightful server, Candace. I arrived early, inquiring about the Left handed Polestar Pilsner, Candace offered a sample, very tasty - with three of my party eventually having it with dinner.  We had a great booth - giving us a vantage point, watching the parade of customers & employees. I really like the airy, roomy, high energy vibe. With our drinks we had the delicious zucchini fires with two sauces an a subtle breading on the zucchini. We all tried different burgers, with some of us tasting each others, Candace made the split arrangements prior to serving us - nice touch. The meat is flavorful, melting in your mouth with a freshly baked bun. Fun, cool atmosphere & great food - made for a great get away, early in the week. My hats off to the Sam Fox team, another winner at ZinBurger."
1,"Buca Di Beppo is literally, italian restaurant hell. You know how all big box chain restaurants throw junk up on the walls in an attempt to make the space feel vintage? Buca Di Beppo throws junk, and knick knacks and statues and anything else italian they could find in the chinese warehouse where they loaded up these goods. Its a terrible horrible mess and you end up sitting in a yardsale of italian paraphenalia while eating your very bland pasta. Its embarassing how truly flavorless the food is here. Thin, flavorless alfredo sauce. Thick slabs of lasagna with less taste than what I can get out of the frozen section at Publix. I went with a large group and across the table, bland food. When they seat your party, they guide you through the kitchen area where the cooks play along and say a welcoming hello. Deep down you know they hate this. Why are we in the kitchen? Sure its nice, but Id rather have them concentrating on making the food, and making it good. Of course, the food at Buca Di Beppo seems to be far beyond any point of return to tasting good. Its just dead. Dead food. No life, no flavor, not emotion. I get more flavor from the $.99 Michelinas frozen lunch package. Far from claiming anything authentic Italian, Buca Di Beppo even pumps out bread with no taste. Eating at Buca is like eating food from an assisted living facility. No salt, no sugar, no butter, no fat, its all gone along with anything resembling taste. Sure, Buca has huge portions, and the setup is nice for large parties and families - but they might as well just buy the family-size pasta packs from the frozen section and bake it at home, even that would be better, and they wouldnt have to the mandatory gratuity. Say what you will about other italian chains like Macaroni Grill, or Olive Garden - at least their food taste like something."
2,"Ate here months ago.  Was excited to finally find a Phoenix sushi venue, and one that also offered brown rice as a sub for sushi dishes (dont quote me on this however, since it has been many months and I may be recalling another venue).   One item did impress me, and that was the complimentary appetizer that was comprised of tempurad chips with perhaps a squid salad topping (?)  I should have just ordered another serving of this!  Instead, I tried an Ao Yasai (mixed gourmet greens with ginger) and a sushi roll w/ brown rice, the latter I thought was price-y considering the very small portion given.  I was so unimpressed by its unexciting flavors that I dont even recall what kind of roll I tried!  Pretty sad, I know.   I told myself I wouldnt go back, but I would like to give Hana another try, perhaps for lunch and/or dinner with a group of friends and have apps and wine/sake!"
4,"Wow, this was one of the best dinners I have had in a long time. I definitely have my favorite spots but it is rare that I have an entree that knocks my socks off. For me, this was the gnocchi dish with the shitake dijon cream sauce. My husband was surprised that I ordered this, since I dont like mushrooms, and luckily for me, the extent of the mushrooms were some medium ones in the sauce. The gnocchi were very tender and the sauce was rich and creamy. I felt like I was eating a delicious mac & cheese with some soft foccaccia bread. OMG. We also ordered the porteguese style mussels that were a fave of my husbands. They were just okay to me but overall, were decent. We also ordered the chorizo and manchego risotto that I really liked. We each had a glass of wine. Our server was kind enough to let me sample the prosecco before I ordered it. Good thing I did because I didnt like it. The server asked what kind of wine I liked and then brought me a taste of their white blend which I enjoyed. Overall, before tip, our bill was $50. Very reasonable for three plates and two glasses of wine.  This place is extremely small inside with 4-6 small table inside and 3-4 tables on their patio. There were two servers and on a busy Fri night, service was slow. But they were very nice and apologetic, so I gave them a break. I noticed the kitchen staff worked extremely efficiently which is a plus for such a small space. I was very impressed. I cannot WAIT to come back here as there were several plates that looked amazing."
4,"Was here awhile back and Sharon Hs review will sum it for atmosphere but i will try and cover my feelings on the taste. The bruchetta is great. Yeah really that simple. I havent tried much but bruchetta here but havent really been disappointed either. Even the ones that ""havent been a fan of"" of the ones i tried when i have mixed and matched when getting to select I still would order over bruchetta at most places as they are still very good. Did try a pizza once and wasnt amazed but nothing stood out (its been awhile since that). The bruchetta however comes to mind every time i hear the word. Oh and the service is very friendly and attentive. One night I was in and they had just finished a major catering event and it had said on the front door that the kitchen was going to be slow until about the time we arrived. Yet when we ordered and it took a bit to get the food (barely a delay in my book and if I hadnt been apologized to by the waiter probably wouldnt have know it was longer than normal) we got a nice little discount."
5,I eat here often and the lunch special is great!!  Food and service are equally good.  Fries are to die for.
5,"I really like this place...  Taking the advice of Yelp we stopped in on our way through downtown.  We were immediately greeted as we walked in. I told the staff it was our first time in and asked which sandwich was the best.  Following the recommendation I ordered the Crackerjack, cracked pepper turkey and melted pepper jack cheese with lettuce, tomato, onion and Russian dressing. We also ordered the Godfather, cappicola, salami, pepperoni and melted mozzarella on garlic toasted bread.  Lets take a moment and show the bread some much deserved love. It tastes fresh with a chewy center and crisp exterior covered in sesame seeds. You could put a shoe on this bread and it would taste great.  I really enjoyed the Crackerjack. The Godfather was good for a few bites, but too rich for me.  I cant wait to come back...  Great choice for lunch downtown for a very fair price.  Unless you are completely starving, share a sandwich!"
4,"Great burgers and menu offerings.  You would expect to get a good burger with a name like that and you do.  The sweet potato fries, Frenched fried onions, and Salmon Salad are very good too.   The decor, location, and menu are restaurant alternative for the area.   The menu was a little confusing and little pricey yet the quality of the food is there and considering the location of the restaurant pricing isnt an issue.   I do recommend to restaurant to others."
4,"Shopping around TMP made me thirsty for a cocktail.  There is some type of Cantina I passed by that did not look relaxing so I went to my Yelp app to see what else was around when I saw the Thirsty Lion.  I was expecting an English pub-like atmosphere and I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in and saw the clean and modern decor.  I sat at the bar, a great thing about this place is that it has HH on the weekends!  The bartender wasnt that great.  He just threw down a drink coaster and walked off.... uh... really?  When he came back around I ordered a specialty drink - mint and cucumber cooler or something like that - I was hoping for more cucumber than mint but the mint was overwhelming, it tasted more like a mint julep.  They did have a great selection of beers on tap but I really wanted a cocktail so the next round was a jack and coke.   I wasnt planning to eat but I noticed some hard-boiled eggs wrapped in sausage on the HH menu, I had to try those, its not often that I see something unique on a menu.  They were pretty good actually. I cant wait to come back."
4,"Ive always had consistent quality of food and service here.   Standard menu....everything is a la carte.  Ive been to this specific location about half a dozen times.... I recommend City Hall or Mastros (N. Scottsdale), over Mortons.  But between Flemings and here, its a tossup.  I would eat at either....but I would probably choose Flemings over Mortons."
5,"The best ! From my first shredded beef taco almost a year ago  ..i have been lovin this place. I also love the number 13 combo platter (.Mini beef chimis ,Gauc ,rice and beans)  The tacos are 5 star fresh and yum ! ... AND reasonably priced."
3,If I hadnt recently found Yogurtland in Scottsdale I would be raving about this place. Unfortunately it is  45 cents an ounce and the other place is 30 cents. Both have a nice variety of flavors but this place is missing the water cooler. You do get a bit sticky from eating your treat. There is something they have that yogurtland doesnt have. They have marshmallow and peanut butter in squeeze containers which is to die for!!
4,"I love this Starbucks. We all know every Starbucks is expensive, so forget that. But these people have our drinks memorized, if you go there alot anyways, theyre on top. Good Starbucks."
5,lululemon is the best clothing store to hit Scottsdale since Ross.  Even though exercise shorts there cost more than an evening in Tijuana they are worth every penny. So what if the pants there cost $160? They are awesome. Would Batman ever question Alfred about how much he paid for the Batmobile? No. Because the Batmobile is awesome and Batman would have paid any price for it.  The mens side of the store doesnt carry a wide collection but what I did find was more magical than the sorting hat at Hogwarts. Everything is so comfortable and if youre overweight most of the pants and shorts have elastic so you dont look like a muffin when you put them on.  I also like the workers there too. They are friendly and helpful and helped me understand that even if I liked some of the womens shirts there it would not be a good idea for me to purchase one and wear it. But I love teal I cried!  If you havent been to lululemon that probably means you hate small animals.
4,"We went to Christophers with the Deal Chicken 3-course dinner.  The food was very good and the service was just as good.  The lobster bisque was a bit too thin for my taste and is something I would pass on in the future. The lamb was delicious and the tuna salad was tasty as well.  We opted to order dessert and the mousse tower was delicious.  We were saddened that they did not have the grand marnier souffle on the night we went, which was highly recommended.  Will return!"
5,"I have been Chipotle faithful for about 2 years now, and it wasnt very difficult.  Restaurants such as Rubios and the Blue Burrito just didnt stack up to a Chipotle burrito.  Then came Qdoba. This restaurant is pretty much a carbon copy of Chipotle (2 of the employees on duty actually worked at my former Chipotle of choice).  I had a chicken burrito (my Chipotle norm) so I could make as direct of a comparison as possible.   The food was great, and afterwards I didnt get that ""punched in the stomach"" feeling that Chipotle gives me for some time after I eat it (I am convinced their rice expands in your stomach, but it tastes good so I suffer through it).   I also picked up their frequent customer swipe card (buy 10 burritos get one free + free chips and salsa after activation).  This place is closer to my place than any Chipotle, so I will be coming very often!  P.S. If anyone if privy to the correct pronunciation let me know! (ku-doh-ba???)"
4,"Saketini opened not too long ago, so theyre still having grand opening specials.  Get em while theyre hot! I havent had their food yet, but I have partaked in their fantastic drink specials.  They have $2 well drinks for happy hour.  Woo hoo! Plus they have a reverse happy hour too, which scores them another star.  Any place that offers late night drink and food specials is alright in my book.  Once I try the food, Ill be back and Ill update the review."
3,"This is your run-of-the-mill sports bar that caters to the not-so-blue-collar 30something crowd of Chandler.  The ambiance is nice, darker, big screen TVs everywhere... the waitresses are attractive (a staple at these types of places) and they are friendly and attentive... ours was on this very day.   Its Beer Week in AZ this week and they had just hosted a SanTan event (pub crawl) today as part of Beer Week, so they were understandably out of SanTan Devils Ale and the place was quite quiet when we arrived at 5pm. We got seated at the patio where the have a nice little Bocce ball area and it was nice to enjoy the great Phx February weather. Alright, so we ordered burgers as we were both in the mood for a sizable piece of beef, hopefully topped with bacon and other yummies.  They did a pretty good job for being a sports bar, but not impressive. They claim their meat is fresh ground, though when thats the case, the patty has a different type of form and is less flat and compacted.. okay, maybe they grind it in the AM and then stockpile patties for the day.. thats fine.  The bacon (I ordered the #9 All Star - cheddar, bacon, beef) was lame... thin, a bit stale-tasting, and not crispy.  The cheese was fine.  I did like that the meat was char-broiled and so it has a good taste to it.  Also, the inside wasnt over cooked and the bread they served it on was kinda sweet and giant... tasty, actually. The sides were blaaaah.. cole slaw was really boring and had literally 3 ingredients (white cabbage, carrots, sugary mayo) something I would expect from Chilis or Dennys. Well, the burger hit the spot but the rest was plain and boring.  The Stella was not as cold as I prefer.  Our staff was very good.  So far, an OK place to visit, but a 4 star place is somewhere I will likely go out of my way to visit.. this didnt make the cut."
5,"I had heard many great things about Penzeys, but it wasnt until recently that I actually went to the store. After shopping around and smelling various spices, I wanted to buy everything in the store! Great for gifts as well!"
5,"I took my daughter there to get her nose pierced for her birthday, they were very nice and professional and made her feel comfortable.  Its a nice shop and they were very friendly and did a great job.  I will definitely recommend them!"
5,"Been twice. Authentic, high quality & great price for what you get. Salsa de Chile de Arbol was the best!! Loved the decor. Orchata tasted fresh, which is a rarity in most Mexican Restaurants."
4,"This cute little neighborhood breakfast/lunch spot just opened up, and is the sister restaurant to Tuck Shop.  The menu is small with super reasonable prices!!  Not much in the way of vegan fare, but I managed to find a tasty dish: The Red Flannel Hash (beet, potato and root vegetable hash sans eggs).  It was very tasty and had a nice amount of black pepper in it.  I also ordered a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice for a grand total $8 and change.  Not too shabby for brekky.   My dining cohorts ordered a frittata topped with sour cream and chives, a Portuguese doughnut and biscuits stuffed with some kind of meat (I forget the name of this dish) and were equally pleased with their meal. Not sure about parking, as we walked over (so awesome!) from their house.  This is a quaint little gem with indoor and outdoor seating.  They also have booze, so you can add a little pizazz to your wake up call.   Great place, cant wait to come back!"
2,"Carls has raised the price on its food so that the $6 burger is now actually almost $6. The big marketing ploy here was that you could get a burger for just a few dollars that was the same quality as what other places charge $6 for. Not anymore. Additionally, they have not resolved the issue of employees that speak so little English that they are unable to either take or execute your order correctly. We have emailed Carls in the past regarding this issue and are just tired of having to bring it to their attention when they get the order wrong (which is most times now).  We have now decided to just go across the street to the In N Out burger at Fiesta Mall for any future burger runs. You can get a burger for half the price and the employees speak English and can get your order right."
5,"A burger? With anything I want? FINE....Ill do it. I need no convincing for a burger, fries and a coke (Thanks Carls Jr.)  Earleir this afternoon, after a heavy morning of househunting with a couple realtors, I decided to sit my fat backside at a table and eat. And eat well. I stumbled into the Five Guys at the Fashion Square mall. Not sure how long its been open. Perhaps it was the grand opening? It was PACKED! But I digress. As soon as you get to this location in the food court of the mall, youll realize that this is not your typical burger joint. They have their own seating separate from the mall-commoners. And their own bathrooms (CLEAN) You get to the counter and you see a sign telling you about the potatoes they are using for the fries you will be eating. Ordering your burger isnt a gong show. Fairly easy. All the toppings are listed and all toppings are FREE! My food was delicious. Got a burger with some of my favorite toppings: onions, tomatoes, etc.  The fries reminded me of an experience I had back in high school, when I held a girls hand for the first time. Soft, perfect and lovely. Thats how these fries felt. Ok that sounded weird. Tough. Oh, I forgot to mention that the soda fountains had COKE ZERO!! EFFING AWESOME! I MEAN THIS IS THE MOST DOPE SODA EVER!!  (Im really hoping this Kanye yelping phase ends soon, since my reviews make me seem like a bigger Jackass than I seem in person). Ultimately, I left this place happy, satisfied and I will come back again. Oh...the answer to the one question in everyones mind? YES, BETTER THAN IN-N-OUT!"
5,"Warning, dont get deterred that there arent any seats for you when you walk in... thats a good sign that the the tables are full with everyone stuffing their faces.  I waited for about 15 minutes for a table to free up, and Im glad I did.  It was kind of a chilly night and I was feeling for something hot.  I decided on the seafood noodle soup and pork pies.  The noodles soup broth was lightly seasoned with a hint of white pepper (just the way I like it), the noodles were thick and hearty, and the portion was substantial.  The pork pies (3) were like a flattened pot sticker that had been pan-fried on both sides, Yum! Definitely, a place serving up genuine Chinese food with the finesse of a home-cooked meal. I cant wait to go back!"
4,"I tried Pork on a Fork at the ASU Tempe farmers market. Beef brisket and pulled pork sandwiches were sold there in a small tent. My sandwich (brisket) was very tasty, albeit a little plain (just meat and bread). There were three great BBQ sauces available - sweet/mild, tart, and spicy. I used a lot of all three, but spicy was the best. I felt like I could drink those sauces! At $6-8, the sandwiches are a little pricey, but they are filling and taste excellent. It would be nice if they came with some corn, beans, or the like to round out the meal."
1,"After a day full of meetings, I gathered the hubster and we headed out to eat some Mexican. I had visions of chips/salsa, and margaritas. We headed to On the Border on Stapley near Baseline but found that this location had closed. Egads. Then we remembered The Salty Senorita across the street. And thus begins the saga. ""Hi, are you here for happy hour?"". We said no but were seated in the bar area anyway. At least we got a booth. Lucky us, huh? Joe ""lots of product in his hair"" brought us menus and took our drink orders. He was pushing a certain type of Tequila and I took the bait, with the stipulation ""on the rocks with salt"". My drink, and hubsters water arrived and we ordered. The chips and salsa AND our dinners arrived at the same time. .Really Joe product??? Chips with the meal? FYI, chips and salsa here arent complimentary, you have to order and pay for them. It was then we noticed ants had taken over our table. At first we thought it was just a couple but noooooooo. The hubster brought the ants to the attention of Joe product and he feigned concern but did not offer to sit us at another table. Now the hubsters getting annoyed. Its hard to enjoy yourself when you are swashing ants off the table. Our booth was by a window but we didnt see any influx from the window of ants, so were not sure where they are coming from, but they dont stop. Hubster mentions it a second time, and then, again with feigned concern he offers to move us to a different table. By this time we are almost done eating and I just say lets finish and get the hell out of dodge. Our bill comes, we pay, and hubster asks for the manager. Hell, hes even younger than Joe Product and looks like he just woke up, thus well call him Bed Head. Bed Head offers to buy us a drink on the house? Really? Thats your solution? He said hed make sure other patrons arent seated in this area. Egads, no thanks, we just wanted to leave. We werent after free food, but the offer of 10% off or some kind of compensation for sharing our entire meal with ants would have been appreciated. A free drink? Hey,maybe one of those $60.00 margaritas would have made everything alright! As far as the food goes-I had the chicken antchiladas (get it, lol) with beans and rice and they were dry. I like my enchiladas with oodles of sauce and cheese, and these had very little sauce with a little design of sour cream on them. Hubster had a steak and avocado salad. He said it was ok.  This is a never return place for us.  And a note to Joe Product-chips and salsa should have arrived WITH the drinks, and before the meal.Reflecting back, we were there on Earth day so perhaps having ants share our meal was relevant. The margarita gets a 7 out of 10 limes as it was pretty good."
5,"Finally, well-qualified, well-established mechanics that dont talk to me like Im a dumb, car-ignorant girl - even if I am. I was sitting at a desk establishing an estimate for my Honda within 20 minutes of calling them. The receptionist was polite and efficient, but truly the best part was their interactive, transparent estimate process. I was able to view the screen as my estimator drag and dropped the parts he suspected I would need into a spreadsheet. Then, I saw him calculate the labor hours - something I had NEVER been privy to before. Tracys Auto Body was affordable, very quick and went above and beyond - alerting me to other pieces that were loose and fixing them for free. I highly recommended their services. They have a perfect record since the mid-1980s with BBB and with good reason."
3,"They dont have the lunch specials on the menu or tell you about them if you dont ask, so make sure to ask. The sandwiches dont come with fries and their fries are over priced for not being very good. The pulled pork sandwich is good and so is the sauce. Also, expect a long wait especially if people are ahead of you."
3,"Alright, so here is my two cents on Brat Haus. I suggest to steer clear of the brats I tried (Beer Brat & Spicy Thai).  I found them a bit dry and bland.  I also found the pretzels less than fabulous. I do suggest to try to big, juicy, tasty, meatballs. Much better choice. The outside patio very cool, an open fresh space with plenty of seating and a big ol wall of funky art. The service was also friendly, and attentive and fair prices. Overall, its totally worth checking out if you are in the area and in the mood for something different."
3,"Lets start with an SAT-type question: Scottsdale Stadium :: AT&T Park is like _______ :: Oakland Coliseum. a) Oakland As b) Rickey Henderson c) Phoenix Municipal Stadium d) Yankee Stadium If you answered C, you, my friend are correct.  And youre pretty smart, too.  Give yourself a pat on the back. Much like Oakland Coliseum, Phoenix Muni wont amaze you with state-of-the-art facilities, breathtaking views or spectacular nightlife nearby.  What you get here is a functional, simple, 40-year-old ballpark that serves its purpose.  The crowds here are much smaller than you would encounter at other parks, but it fits 6000-7000 people comfortably.  Unless you are in the premium infield seats, you will be sitting on the aluminum benches or on the grassy knoll.  Pick your poison, so to speak. We always get the infield seats, because you can sit 12 rows behind home plate for under $20.  I dont care how bad the economy is, its a steal!  Even if you sit directly behind home plate, you will most likely struggle to see the tiny outdated scoreboard screen in the centerfield.   There are no fancy food choices at Phoenix Muni.  If youre not intimidated by enormous wieners, a footlong hot dog might be for you.  Believe me when I say, you will not be able to eat more than two, no matter how much you love hot dogs.  I am also a fan of the little dining area by the left field foul pole.  You can sit there at a table with a giant umbrella, hide from the sun and sip your beverage of choice.  If youre lucky, you can even watch the game from some of those seats. The people who work here, from ushers to concession stand clerks, are incredibly nice.  They really do want to make sure you have a great time at the game, and it shows. Parking here is very easy.  For $5, you can park in the lot right across the street.  The lot rarely gets full, and you can always almost find a spot.  I hear there are ways to find free parking if you are willing to walk a little more, but at $5, why would you?  Its important to know, though, that the walk from the lot ""across the street"" from the ballpark will take you about 7 minutes.  There is no crosswalk on the street, and you have to use that ridiculous pedestrian bridge they erected with the sole purpose of annoying most baseball fans. So, +1 star for great seats, +1 star for cheap parking, -1 star for horrible scoreboard, -1 star for the pedestrian bridge.  A-OK, 3 stars."
2,"I travel a lot for business and usually stay in Hampton Inns.  This one less than impressed me.  First and foremost, it is a motel.  The door to the rooms open to the outside, which is not typical of a Hampton Inn. I was concerned to stay in such a hotel at first since I am a woman traveling alone.  The area is ok, and the hotel area seems to be pretty safe and well lit. The lobby and pool area are very pretty, but again...the doors open to the outside so when I was positioned right near the pool, I could hear everything that went on.  The bed was standard Hampton Inn bed (comfy) but the room was small.  My biggest complaint, by far, is how bad the noise carries.  Im still sitting in the room and I can hear the entire conversation going on next door...I can make out every single word.  Additionally, I can hear the person upstairs.  Their sound insulation is terrible.  There is a gap around my door (and remember, it opens to the outside) so can hear everything that goes on outside, too.  Theyve done a nice job of spiffying it up, but I did not find it to be appropriate for a business traveler."
4,We had a great meal here! I started with the cheap salad as I was craving salad.  HIt the spot. Hubby started with smashed irishman drink and loved.  He moved onto a draft beer. I moved onto Fish and Chips-they were light and just the right size. Hubby had beef stroganoff-he said it was tasty. We ended with the fabulous salted caramel-my fav thing of the night. I think the bill was $62 before tip-pretty reasonable to me.
3,"The service was great! We had a large group & had called prior to make a reservation. Our table was ready when we arrived & they had assigned 2 servers. They were both incredibly pleasant & attentive. Our food came out really quickly & no one had any complaints. I wouldnt say this was authentic Mexican food, but it doesnt have to be. A good time was had by all :)"
4,"This was my first time to Sekong By Night.  I have had Khmer food before, which is ironic, as my wife is from Vietnam, but never had Khmer food from Cambodia.  She has to come to the USA to experience Khmer food!!  I have eaten Khmer food in San Francisco CA, and in Siem Reap. Both my wife and I were pleasantly surprised with Sekong By Night.  It looks like a tiny little forgettable restaurant from outside on the street, but once you step inside. you can see the owner put some thought into the decor.  It really looks Asian.  It is as though the owner went on a shopping trip to Phnum Penh and came back with tons of artwork for the place.   The Amok fish is really nice.  Reminded me of a cafe I had dinner at in Siem Reap some 9 years ago when I was seeing Angkor.  The fish was fresh.  My wife wanted to switch with me (she ordered the Katheaw Cha).   The Katheaw Cha is also very good.   I ordered a Coconut Juice as my drink expecting it to be canned.  It was fresh, and smelled fresh (a pleasant surprise!!!) My wife ordered the Grass Jelly drink, and it was also good.   I really wish that this place was in Mesa AZ, as I would go more often.  Maybe so, I will make the drive again to this place from Mesa as appropriate.  This place was a pleasant surprise and I wish the owner great success.  I want this restaurant to succeed.   The only place where the Khmer food was better (for me) was Siem Reap, but then it is perhaps a little unfair to compare a restaurant in the USA to what really is available in Cambodia."
2,"Just not a great Sushi Roku location.  The service was okay and the ambience was too - but the food wasnt fabulous and the sushi chef knew very little of the food he was serving.  When sitting at the sushi bar in a fine dining japanese restaurant you kind of expect the chefs to be spot on and knowlegable about the food.  Not the case here.  If you want to spend this kind of money, go to Roka Akur - its fantastic and worth every penny."
2,"My wife and I were looking for a dinette table. We looked at many places and ended up at the RoomStore. We found a great table and decided to purchase the item.  The salesman was nice and didnt provide too much pressure.  There is a LARGE selection of items-couches, tables, chairs, dressers etc. My problem was that we bought the table and had a deferred pickup due to moving into a new home several weeks down the road. I placed a small down payment to reserve my item. After several weeks, I contacted the RoomStore to pick up my item since I just moved into my new home. My item was not in stock and was told to call back later in the week. I called 4 days later and was informed the item was now available.  Today, I went to pay the balance of my purchase and take home the table. Small problem, the table and chairs are not at this location.  I was given the choice to pick up the item at the distribution center 30 minutes away or wait until until Tuesday. I wish that during my several contacts during this process that someone would have told me that I wouldnt be able to pick up my item here or wait several other days. I was not happy! Now I have to go back once again to pick up the table and chairs."
5,Great food!!! The French dip is to die for!! Great Service! Clean and fancy especially for the area its located in!  Def a hidden gem! My husband and I both love going here and cant wait until next time.
5,"Humdinger!   What more is there to say.  Its the best sandwich ever.  It tastes even better on the weekends when Kids Eat FREE!  If you have a larger family ( more than 2 kids ), this is the best deli in town."
3,"The food and drinks are blah, but the service is always great! Happy hour and trivia are always fun at Skip & Jans."
5,Im usually one to prefer chicken - but when the only option for tacos is steak you go with it.  I ordered the taco and was rewarded with tender steak with lots of flavor.  Our lunch crew has gone back several times and the service is always fast and friendly.  For the size and price - order multiples.  Love the salsa bar.  Adding cucumbers is now my favorite treat.
5,"Kona grill is never a disappointment.  Sushi, the regular menu, the atmosphere.....  The staff is very friendly and the food is very good!  We like to create our own sushi dishes and the chef is always ready and willing!  I highly recommend Kona Grill for consistently good food!"
5,"A must!  One of the BEST dog food stores in the Valley!  Great service and quality, natural feed products for your dog.   You can rest at peace knowing that your pets are in GREAT hands. Mark Siebel http://www.doggiestepsdogtraining.com/"
4,"Fantastic pizza for the price! One of our favorite take-out spots. Ask for the daily special as you can usually get wings, soda and pizza for the price of a large pizza. Great deals, great prices and quick service. Not a place to go sit and eat - strictly take-out."
4,"The cookies and breakfast pastries are to die for.  Just for those two items they deserve four stars.  Everything else, however, is just OK.  The rest of their foods are good but not great.  If youve ever been to Wildflower, I think their food is better there but dang, I can go to Paradise and just pig-out on their cookies!"
3,"Dam you Doug !!! Ok, I thought I be the first but Doug beat me to it.   Any establishment that has a free happy hour for its guest is a plus nuff said. Yes -the 4th floor grill is awesome and the bar staff will give you the Ins & outs of Scottsdal-ing culture and the pizza they serve is pretty dam good- the complimentary breakfast was was actually good too.  Im not sure if they still do the free happy hour thing but what sold me on this lets say resort - is that while I was there , there was a whole bus full of girls that where promoting - some kinda of alcoholic beverage - and I heard from a good source many beverage companies uses the Chaparral as a pit stop for their promotional tours...  Word- I guess they come for the pools..."
4,Went in after a day of shopping with my mother. We walked into the bar side and decided we wanted to sit in the pew benches on the restaurant side instead. We ordered waters and sodas while munching on a side of chips. My mom got the chicken pot pie and loved the crust and the moist chicken. I got the Meat and Cheese. Although I wish the cheese was a bit more melty the sage pork sausage was great. The dipping gravy tasted of beer. Great addition. The music was fun and the bartender dancing to the music was fun. Great lunch! Will go again when Im in Tempe. Another plus: enough for left overs!
3,Cute little coffee shop. Had some tea and sat outside with my boyfriend. Enjoyed the weather and played some cards. Very relaxing.
5,"LOVE the Four Peaks. Can get crowded as hell, and parking is a bit of a cluster F, but Ive never ever not had a fun night there.  The beer is excellent, the service has always been attentive, and the food is above normal bar standards The fish and battered fries was very good, the tartar sauce is good, but ask for the cocktail sauce . . . its fantastic.  Heavy on the horseradish enough to feel it in your nose!  And the Rueben might just be the best in town. The happy hour is great.  $3 locally brewed pints?  Sign me up The location and the it being an actual brewery gives it extra points.  I had family in town this week, and I like to take out of towners to places that have a local AZ vibe.  They definitely got a taste of MY Arizona.  Next time theyll have to come during Pumpkin Porter season"
5,"Nellos is the best!  Great local feel, great food, love this place. You have to have:  (Gluten Free) Pizza, Garden Salad with Turkey and House Dressing.  It will soon be your go to feel good order."
3,"So let me start by saying the latte was very good, best Ive had in this area at least. Much better than Starbucks, even though thats not a very high standard but one that everyone can relate to.  Good atmosphere, comfortable seat and lots of it... The live music was deceiving as it looked good for the out side (dont we all) and sounded horrible (but Im not reviewing that am I) :)  I was actually helped by a guy there who matched the place well. Good service with a grin and not the overly caffeinated pep talk baristas of a certain chain often feel pressured to give. Ill be back if only for the latte."
4,"I stayed here for work and had some meetings in the area which made the location very convenient for me. I just hopped in my car and was at my office 5 minutes later. The hotel seemed pretty new-ish and there were free cookies at check in. There is also a restaurant downstairs and a gym if youre into that sort of thing. My room was clean and well kept.  My only minor complaint about the room would be that the air conditioning is super loud! There are a couple of restaurants right outside, but they close pretty early. Other than that there isnt too much close by, but if you drive up the street a few blocks to Happy Valley, you can find every big box store and chain restaurant imaginable."
4,"How this place has less than four stars is a mystery to me. I have been 5 times and have taken out of towners here 2 out of the 5 and they all left saying it was yummy too. The El Presidential Especiale is a MUST - i order 86 the onions and add machaca/shredded beef. They are a simple yummy combination with their rice and beans. This is just straight up classic mexican food - not for the snobby. So if you want a more classy joint thats less authentic - hit up ZTejas cause this place is not for you. The hot salsa in the ketchup bottles is always a sign of a great mexican joint (and its hot AND tastey - a combination not many get correct). I will say their chips can be a little on the less crunchy, more oily side but they are more than happy to replace that with some that are a little more to your liking. And their margs are delish as well. This place deserves a 4 because of consistency, friendly and accomodating atmosphere and just downright solid take on enchiladas - red sauce is spot on. Thanks Tee Pee for being our go-to for Mexican food in the Valley of the Sun!"
4,"I hate to find out that there was another location closer to where I was.  It doesnt matter because it was worth the trip.  I ordered pick up because I was by myself and wanted to a bit of exploring.  The place has a nice casual ambiance.  They also have an outdoor seating area.  I ordered the pad thai that comes with chicken and shrimp as a standard.  Since it was lunch time, it was part of the lunch menu that came with a choice of soup or salad.  I chose the soup, but was too stuffed to have it because I jumped right into the pad thai.  I ordered it medium spicy, and it was pretty spicy.  I cant imagine what hot would have tasted like.  Actually, Im more curious of what it would have tasted like in a mild flavor.  The noodles were slightly overcooked, but still flavorful.  I also had the Thai Iced Tea here, and it was perfect for the weather and a great combination with the tangy pad thai flavor.  The prices are expensive compared to Chicago, but I hear its typical for Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  My lunch speciai and drink costed me a little over $15.  I guess if you are craving it that bad like I was, youll pay the price..."
4,"4.5 Stars... I really enjoyed Becketts table! Its a large, cool looking room with exposed ceiling and brick walls. They have a small patio and I heard theyre planning to build a large patio on the side of the building.  I met a couple friends there and we shared a few different items:  The drink list has some great looking combos and a nice variety of wines. I tried the Palmaire, a lemonade/pomegranite combo. Very refreshing!  We had the grilled cheese with pancetta to start... I love a good grilled cheese and these were perfect little bites. It came with roasted red pepper tomato soup. The soup tasted like pureed roasted red peppers; I would have preferred a little more balance with tomato taste.  The roasted brussel sprouts were sumptuous; intense flavor and a little crisp on the outside.  The fire roasted green chile pork stew was very tasty. The corn bread that came with had a perfect sweet contrast. I tried a bite of my friends short rib - very tender and lean.  We ended with the creme brulee, which came with fresh blackberries. At first I passed on having bites (Im not a huge fan of creme brulee), but they pressured me into trying it... YUM! I may be a convert now.  Overall, a great pick! Shout out to Katie B. for the suggestion."
5,"Their emu oil is great.  I use it for inflammation of my jaw and shoulders, its wonderful.  I highly recommend it.  We buy it at Fresh Vitamins in Mesa.  No dyes, fully refined, I love it."
5,"We were in town on Business and Pleasure and had a chance to visit Aiellos with our Children, 10 and 7.  What a TREMENDOUS experience it was overall and then to top it all off, a chance to win ""dinner on the house"" via drawing a number out of a bucket, was simply superb.  We didnt win but will definitely come back next time we are in town as the food, staff, and overall dining experience was unbeatable!"
3,"Went here to meet up with LA friends during Superbowl weekend. The decor is pretty unique here and the bathrooms are quite the trip. Bartenders are ace, cocktail waitresses are good looking, and the music is a healthy mix of bangers and decent indie hits. Tip for the door guys there dont let in 6 dudes at a time, even if they are Persian dudes with tons of cash who want to buy bottles. Boo!"
1,"Quick spot for a mall-made mayo-based California roll. This is where you go to learn how sushi can go wrong. Youve been hard at work doing swipe-and-sign. Perhaps you even dropped a thousand bucks at Neimans on a worthless Jhane Barnes sweater and some silk-lined Zanella slacks or three thousand on a whats-left-of-last-seasons-collection of Brioni blazer. Whatever your fancy, youre toting a wrist full of roped, glossy, shooshing-sounding bags with tissue paper sticking out the tops. You just want a break and some cool refreshing sushi. Its OK, but beware. Unagi and other ""hot"" items have a ""beep-beep beep-beep"" before they get to you. California and spicy tuna rolls come real quick -- cause they come from a vat of mayonnaise. Rice is not right either. Stick to tuna and salmon sashimi and miso soup. If head chef Rick is there (think Kyoto of Empire at 24th and Camelback, then Ichi Ban, University off McClintock), ask him to make you a Fat Bob on Acid, for good ol times sake. Or just go to Starbucks, tide yourself over, and find a real sushi restaurant. And about the Brioni... Dont sweat the buyers remorse. Itll make a great tax deduction to Florences."
5,"This is an amazing taco truck just minutes from the airport. I ordered the amazing ceviche and a barbacoa burrito, while my girlfriend ordered three tacos. Ive said it before and Ill say it again here: this truck is an excellent example of the inverse correlation between price and taste in Mexican food. Eat here before your next flight!"
5,"Probably the best mall Ive ever been to. Anchored by five mega stores - Nordstrom, Nieman Marcus, Macys, Dillards and Barneys New York. Its so big, it took a couple of hours just to walk it. My wife called it the best mall shes ever been too. Nuff said."
5,"This place is absolute perfection.  From the setting to the service to the food, I loved every moment of it.  The only way I found out about this place was through Yelp.  You seriously are my trusty sidekick.  From the previous reviews I was a little worried that it might be packed, but then I remembered it was a Monday night so no worries. Walking in the restaurant, it is quite small, but just absolutely adorable.  It really does feel like an upscale country home.  Wood lines the whole restaurant and they have mini chandeliers hanging over every table.  Even the touches of place setting are just perfect. Our server was Gina and she was a complete sweetheart.  We started off with the Bohemian Sidecar and the Cucumber Vesper.  Both were absolutely delightful!  Then we moved on to appetizers, because while getting drunk is fun, I was really excited for the food.  We had the steak tartare and mussels in the saffron and white wine sauce.  I loved the steak tartare with the potato chips and fried egg on top.  Put fried egg on top of anything and Im sold.  Put fried egg on top of raw steak and Im in love!  The mussels came out just as we were finishing up the steak tartare, perfect timing!  The mussels were equally amazing if not more, and I am so sad that they only give one piece of bread!  Well that, along with the bread and butter.  But that still wasnt enough for me!  I wanted to soak up all of that saffron sauce goodness! After Gina cleared that out of our way, she brought out the glass of Bordeaux and Rhone blend.  I hate when I dont have a drink in front of me, and she made sure that never happened.  Then the entrees came.  The pork shoulder with the bacon for my bf, and the stuffed chicken with the pome puree and mushrooms for me.  Again, absolute perfection on both accounts!  I loved the mushrooms that were slightly charred and crispy, with the sauce and the puree and the chicken with goat cheese.  Im getting hungry again just writing about it.  My bf loved his, but I still maintain that mine was better.  And both of these entrees were incredibly reasonably priced at $15 and $17.  Could life get any better? Well apparently it could!  After we polished off our entrees, then came dessert and after dinner drinks!  We had the souffle which was amazing with the creme anglaise.  And the berries with the creme fraiche.  Heaven in my mouth!  We finished that off with the chocolate martini and the pear tini. This review cannot do this place justice.  This is truly a unique experience that is far above any of the restaurants in Scottsdale.  Please go in and experience this for yourself, you will not be disappointed!"
1,After moving back to the area from Cali I needed somewhere  to get my acrylics done. I usually like to get some kind of design or unique tips. After walking in I saw some tips I liked so I decided to try out this place. The first visit was bad the nail tech would not listen to the length of nails I was requesting and did a terrible job at shaping them. I always give people more than one chance so I went back and this time I got a pedicure first then the nail tech left the salon and I sat near the dryer for 45  min before approaching the manager about the length of time I had been waiting for a fill. He replied unapologetically that the tech had to leave to pick up her son from school... I sat another 15 min before I was seen by someone else. They also did a poor job. I will not spend my money somewhere that they do not value their customers. Not to mention they did a crap job and were overpriced when it came to designs and tips with prints on them. Dont waste your time here.
1,"I waited 45min and ended up with a tiny gross little serving of tortilla with vegetable scraps thrown in it, served in a aluminum take-out box. The tables are folding tables, like the kind you play beer pong on. And they have pictures of kids and babies on the walls and signs asking people to send in pictures of their kids for the walls too, which has nothing to do with Asian/Mexican cuisine, it creeped me out."
5,"OOOOOWWWEEEE!! Have yall tried ATL Wings yet!!! If not what are you waiting for!  They are the BOMB Diggity! I dont know why I havent updated my review either, so here I go!  The honey habanero are still my #1 but I also love the Cajun Hot!  Holy Crap!! Get some of the Cajun Hot wings and some ranch and their hot sauce on the side, dip your wing in the ranch and then the hot sauce and watch out!! The only time you really feel the burn is when youre no longer eating, gums & tongue just be blaze hot and mouth just be water for more, yes my friends thats the heat I love!! Luv me some wings from ATL!"
3,"Im always on the lookout for cool places to bring out of town friends and this place seemed to fit the bill.  Its a sustainable farm that produces Arizonas only extra virgin olive oil.  I came in for lunch and as I pulled into the GRAVEL parking lot my stomach turned because I had expensive heels on and knew they were going to take a beating (I know, ""waaah"" right? But there are women out there that love their shoes as much as I do and will appreciate the heads-up).  Once I entered the Olive Mill I was delighted to see how adorably quaint it was inside.  The building was split in two, market on one side, bistro on the other with seating in between both and also outside.  The market had testers of all their products, great idea but the food testers didnt seem sanitary so I didnt try anything.  I ended up buying some awesome hand balm that I love.  They had a really great wine selection as well.   Alright so heres the bad part.  The entire time I was there, not one employee greeted me or cracked a smile.   There was one guy in particular that was going back and forth stocking shelves and was visibly annoyed by my presence.  When I went to order my sandwich, I remembered I got a free drink with my Yelp check-in.  The girl at the counter sighed and rolled her eyes as I scrambled through my purse to find my iphone and she said ""forget it, I got it.""  Their sandwich the ""Kalamata"" had its 15 seconds of fame on the food network so I was going to get that but opted for the ""Lucca"" at the last second because it has brie...I love brie more than I love most family members.  The sandwich was a disappointment.  All the ingredients were there but it was devoid of any flavor and I couldnt figure out why.   I probably wont be bringing any of my homies here but I will drop by to buy products, I fully support local businesses."
5,"My husband and I have been going here for a few years now. It is one of our favorite places. Really low key, affordable, amazing food! Between the 2 of us our bill is never more than $10 and we are always stuffed! I love how casual it is and the humus cannot be beat!"
5,"Good reviews are easy to write. Stop reading this and just go eat there!  OK, well I have visited this place for years now and dont go anywhere else if I am in this area.  I like the Chefs, they are friendly and quick. They speak pretty good Spanish to me and but I dont dare try to respond in Japanese, ha ha.  The value is phenomenal, where can two people get miso soup, salad, beans, tea, ice cream and sushi rolls all for under $20?  Ive tried the same at Say Sushi in my hometown of Maricopa and cant do it for under $40 or more for two.  All you can eat is available but I find that ordering individually is more economical.  Great atmosphere for a quick lunch or a large party for dinner.  The waitresses are Asian and I find that suitable for the restaurant. Some reviews on here complain about them. I dont have any issue with them they have always treated me nice and done their job well.  I will keep coming back."
3,"I love that walking through the doors of the Sugar Bowl is like taking a step back in time but what I dont love is that it looks like it hasnt been cleaned or had any restoration work done since the day it opened. Lets be honest though, I didnt come here for the decor, I came for the ice cream.  I was very excited when I saw the sundae covered in chocolate, cherries and marshmallow creme. I love marshmallow creme and chocolate, always a recipe for success when these two ingredients are combined. Well, no luck. They were out of marshmallow creme. I got a brownie sundae instead, only ate half and decided that it was only ok.  I probably wont go back to this place. There are too many good dessert options out there. Though if my friends insisted, I would more than likely oblige."
5,"I have been coming to Lux for years ever since I started graduate school here in AZ.  What is there to say that hasnt already been said other than hands down it is my go-to coffee spot in Arizona.  Such a warm and diverse group of people, rotating artwork, the perfect study music playing in the background (although it is played a bit loud), espresso roasted on-site and baked goods made on-site.  Always find an excuse to end up there for a café au lait or a velvet if I have a sweet tooth!"
4,"As a vegetarian and sporadic health nut, I just love TJs. They have a nice array of inexpensive fresh produce, including my beloved broccolini, for 40% of what Safeway charges. Huge selection of frozen veggie-friendly dinners, good for my on-the-go household. Greek yogurt, cheap. Nice beer selection with lots of cheapo wine. I try to buy all my supplements here too, as they seem to be a lot less expensive. Yes, Im all about saving cash on groceries and whatnot. The downside? Its not one-stop-shopping; a trip always requires supplementation with another trip to a ""regular"" grocery store. This particular TJs is teeny-tiny-small, and always chock-full of obnoxious and/or oblivious people who wield carts like weapons. My favorite is the woman who thinks its an awesome time to teach little Jimmy how to push his own wee cart and comparison shop, and lets the little bastard cruise all over the store willy-nilly. Im all for giving your kid responsibility, but a) you still have to, you know, keep an eye on the kid and b) a super-crowded claustrophobic nightmare like this place after work is not, repeat, NOT the time to do so."
4,"Perfect patio for a Saturday! This place walks a fine line between being too snooty and being just plain awesome.  Ive had a couple of experiences here, and overall the food is really tasty.  Im a fan of the gnocchi, even though its a little different than traditional gnocchi. The location is great, as long as there isnt a douche bag convention going on, and as long as the bartenders and servers keep their positive attitudes, I think this place will be around for a while. Thanks!"
5,"The food in this place is indescribably awesome! Granted, the place could be nicer, but if youre in the mood for great food without the frills of a great looking place: this is it. The service is fast, friendly, and the prices are great- especially knowing that their portions are typically huge. I cant finish my plate most of the time, so I always end up taking leftovers home.  I love their Jade Red Chicken, as well as their emerald chicken. Their black beans are to die! Order a combo plate, if this is your first time here. Youll get a good mix of everything and youll leave without regrets!"
5,"What can I say... we eat here once a week for lunch cuz we can walk here. We come here for happy hour twice a week cuz we can walk here.  So, yeah its pretty convenient... but we STAY here after hours to play poker because the servers know us by name and the food is priced right and the poker crowd is really cool and its a great place to eat-n-learn. And we LOVE Tony because that guy says hello to EVERY CUSTOMER EVERY TIME.  Trust me on this one... jump off the freeway for happy hour... youll know what I mean when Tony says hello to you, too. PS get the three meat calzone. You look great and can afford the calories..."
4,"Love this place. Actually, today was awesome, because they usually only offer the ""express dozen"" through the drive thru, and the kids didnt want to go in, so the dude behind the speaker actually fulfilled my order as I wanted. The only thing that bugs the hell out of me is that they charge for 2 donuts when you get a long john. :-("
5,"I Felt a sin coming on .......  if i could give 10 stars i would !!!! Let me set the scene for you of this Kazilicious Sunday night ..... We enter through  a solid planked door set in the rear ...(oh yes the truth is inside) candlelit passageway leads you into a sexy,sultry stone interior that is softened by the plush seating , dim lighting ,wine barrels .. i give his hand a squeeze and smile because we have hit the mother load within this sinfully sexy speakeasy .The Tuscan colors coupled with the stone ..deep ,rich ,decadent !!! His hand on the small of my back as we approach our seats as the intimacy and ambiance takes hold . A bowl of olives, 3 cheese fondue with apple ,the Tuscany pizza ....sexy damn noshes ..they know what they are doing here ..soft ...firm....dip....bite ..yesssss SO beyond sexy here..... Oh and the wine ,nectar of the gods, sign of fertility , here in this setting it is like Ambrosia ,and your inner God or Goddess will surely blossom ,and romance will bloom .... It seems like thousands of labels here - we went with the  M. Chapoutier Le Sizeranne 98 ....Heady ,earthy ,smoky ,deep ,sweet and ripe .the smell of currants and berries .lovely texture ,full bodied .....DIVINE ! let the flirting begin ..coy toying of the glass stem ..sweet smiles ..love words escaping on a whisper  between sips. We spent around $200 ,worth every penny in my opinion . Prior to the Kaz , the Rokerij was just about the sexiest spot to me in the valley ...these two must share the crown . So to recap ; SEXY, SULTRY,SEDUCTIVE !!!!! posh,swank ... Good Service , lush wine selection ,yummy tidbits ... Ambiance up the wazoooo . A heady experience ..this is where lovers go ,a prelude to the interlude of love !"
5,"I love Gabriel. He does an amazing job every single time Im there. I generally get two peekaboo highlights put in, and a cut and style, and always leaving looking great. His attitude is always upbeat, it would be impossible to spend any time in his chair and not leave in a good mood. The salon is always clean and comfortable. I never feel like Im being forced into spending more money or buying product, but when I have a question about what I should be using in my hair Gabe always makes excellent suggestions. I have recommended him a good friend and my mother and both love him. My mother even left her stylist of 10 years to start going to him because of the excellent service he provides."
4,Great food at a great price. Not the best Italian food but definitely a step up from all of the national chains. Also great lunch prices
2,"My favorite thing about this place is the decor. It is crazy beautiful. I also like that you can get better than average bar food until late and there are so many places to sit, youll never have an issue with waiting. Their food is okay, but nothing spectacular.  I used to live in Arcadia, and I miss it every day. If I were to move back to Phoenix/Scottsdale- I would never even consider a different neighborhood. Across the board, it is the friendliest and most beautiful neighborhood in Maricopa County. That being said- The Vig represents the lame element of the neighborhood. People with too much money and bad taste. I think someone else called it ""schmoozy"" and thats exactly it! As a neighbor, we usually rode our bikes- so I cant speak to parking. Do they not still have the shuttle? Give me The Great Escape, JTs or Postinos any day."
5,"Every time I go in this place its always a great experience.  My wife and I have been going to Lucilles pretty much every other Sunday for the last couple months.  Her favorite is the pulled pork mine is the Kansas City ribs, but we always have to start our meal off with the fried pickles.  If youre on a tight budget even buying one meal and sharing it is a definite option.  Sometimes I get full on the biscuits and spread the provide in the beginning. The bar area is a great place to have a meal and watch a game.  I would highly recommend this establishment to any of my friends.  But make sure you get the fried pickles... you will not be disappointed. Oh yeah.....please please please order the Mac N Cheese as your side.  You will thank me later. Q"
4,"Lunchtime out with a relative on a weekday, and La Condesa has a seat by the window. There is really nothing like its saloon-artsy walls for us to gaze.   The Dia De los Muertos motif and wooden furniture make it perfect for easy conversation.   Most folks seated around us already know where to go for lunch thats not too pricey and homemade.   The Horchata is nothing short of liquid dessert, filled with pecans, fruit and rice milk.  You can avoid dairy all together with this and a special bullet burro with guac and lettuce. The salsa bar sets the standard for good restaurants.  Its wide variety of salsas leave little doubt what creative people run the place.  My hope is that only a few people read this and try it. Otherwise, to my chagrin, the next time we park on 16th Street, we may have to WAIT in a line outside."
4,"I adore Radio Milano. Tried to hit it up this last Thursday evening and found it to be closed. I was really depressed by this as I have had my eye on the deviled eggs and the beautiful bartender boy the last couple of times Ive dined here. (neither of which Ive been able to try yet...booooo!!)  According to the valet guy across the street at Postino they are scheduled to re-open in early April. Apparently with somewhat more of a ""lounge like"" feel or some such nonsense. Works for me!  I hope they keep the Tuna Crudo around which is just insanely good. Drown yourself in some chocolate pudding for desert, you wont regret it. Ahhhhh, now Im hungry... dont worry about me, he was too pretty to be straight anyway."
2,"Weve been here several times with our kids and grandkids.  Its a good family spot, but the service is just okay.  We love the fresh chips, and the wings are good.  Salads are meh.  Well come again because its a good spot for the kids, but well come expecting not great service."
4,"Most of my excitement and ""love"" of this place has more to do with what it represents -- not what it is right at this second, but I fully expect that to get better. TFM representing a place in Central Tempe to get basic groceries (all the better that theyre local and organic!) without needing access to a car.  When I looked up the location, I felt heartsick at the thought that this is right across the street from where the Co-Op used to be. Whats there now? An empty dirt lot. The Co-Op was driven out by an over zealous real estate company that, in the boom of condo building, bought the location, driving Co-Op to another spot where it eventually failed. Know what else failed? That condo endeavor. Now, a few years later, we have this budding marketplace with a lot to live up to. My first trip in, I didnt have anything particular I needed, I just wanted to check things out (though I was making enchiladas later that day, so had a few items I was on the look-out for).  Its pretty small right now, and in the former building of Jakes Shop, which is also another Tempe staple now gone. But it had the basics such as milk, peanut butter, a small selection of produce -- local, of course -- cheese and even some gift-type items for sale in the back.  I picked up some green onions (99 cents for a bunch) and red peppers ($1.29/ea), and thought those prices were exact with a chain grocery. And bread - this is my favorite part of the store! A big selection of sliced wheats and grains, and rolls and longer Ciabatta styles too. And the favorite of my favorite? Fresh ""Made this morning!"" tortillas! They looked delicious, and were HUGE. The size of a large pizza, they came in flavored varieties for making yummy wraps. When I checked out ($5 minimum for credit card purchases, and a sign said ""EBT coming soon""), I was offered another red pepper from a basket by the register because this small batch was about to go bad. So instead of letting them and then throwing them away, they *give* them away with each purchase - wonderful!  Oh, and I was surprised and pleased to see a small corner of the store set up with a couple small tables and a couch, all within view of a large flat screen playing Alice in Wonderland. Sure enough, a kid sat there, out of the way and quiet, while is parents shopped. Both parents and the childless thank the owners for THAT kid haven, Im sure. I really look forward to coming in again and again and watching this place grow and thrive. p.s. I highly recommend becoming a fan of their FB page, so you can get daily info about what they just got in, specials, new additions, etc."
1,"Overcrowded, sprawling mess of a mall (and I normally like malls). Traffic and parking are almost as bad as at Tempe Marketplace. The confusing layout makes it hard to find specific stores (even with the help of the directories)."
5,"This review pertains to carnitas, and as such should not be taken as a suggestion for ordering any of the following: fish tacos, rice, beans, horchata. Thats about it! Yum!"
2,"We went here for the fabulous UYE. As the restaurant is often empty, Julia though it would be good to give them some business...but in the end it was our group that ended up being given the business. The words highway robbery come to mind, but I guess we werent really on the highway. The prices listed on the menu really didnt seem that out of line, a bit on the pricey side but nothing alarming. Our waitress slyly sold us a kazillion dollars worth of appetizers that were not on the menu. We got 4 plates which consisted of 4 individual sauces with some stuff in them...one had shrimp, one had chicken, one had pork, and one had chihuahua. Oh wait, I think that was the cheese on top. Anyway, the plate with 4 tablespoons of sauce was not worth the $25...oh wait, we got 4 of them. The waitress also managed to slip two orders of guacamole in on us for $11 a piece. As far as the entrees are concerned, the portions were small and the food was kind of meh. The mole was way too sweet for my taste. The biggest bummer of all was NO BOOZE! The $120 worth of appetizers would have gone over much better if they were washed down with some frosty margaritas. A couple of pitchers and they could have slipped us some $100 flan. Regardless of the price and the mediocre food, it was well worth going for the amazing company of the awesome Phoenix Yelpers. I dont think I would go back for the food though."
4,First time impressions are the most important and Culinary Dropout made an ever lasting one. Everything from the service to the food was spot on perfect. The whole experience was so good that its hard to believe it will be the same when I go back.  I hope it is............
1,"Price reflects quality and service.  5/2010 purchased wedding gown, brides maids and mothers (bride and groom mothers and grandmothers) dresses.  Girls were rude and our brides maids dresses seems and straps fell apart just before the wedding."
5,"One of my top choices for downtown Phoenix. Always an upscale, posh vibe, but with very generous prices on entrees. Good looking people throughout this bar.  The Kisras are VERY tasty and a good spin off the typical flatbreads at many restaurants now.  Brunch here on Saturdays or Sundays-- great drink specials too."
2,"I came in here wanting and expecting this place to be amazing.  I wanted this place to be 5 stars. ugh, I feel like a failure for giving it 2.  Ive heard such good things about this place, and was expecting it to be good, but unfortunately, it was not.  :-( I walked in and placed my order.   The menu seems to be decent enough, with a fair amount of selection.  Ample amounts of toppings, and you can have your burger a few different ways. Mind you, Im a burger lover, so Im always up for places like this. I ordered a regular burger with all the fixings and BBQ sauce on top.  I got the fries too.  It came in a brown bag..I guess thats how they serve it regardless if you eat in or not. I was dissappointed with the burger itself.  It seemed like it came with way to much topping. I mean, like an overwhelming amount.  I ate it, and the burger was okay, but not as good as I have experienced at other comparable places.  I wasnt looking to be ""blown away"" by the burger, but I wasnt really impressed over all.  It wasnt that great, to much on the toppings, and it didnt really do much for me.  I will say tho, you get a TON of fries tho. I left feeling underwhelmed, and dont know that I will be back in the future."
4,Great service and delicious breakfasts!
4,"Same great Lolos fried chicken and waffles without the risk of getting stabbed or shot... and it WAS worth the risk to visit their South Phoenix location on occasion. The food is that good, it might even be the ultimate in comfort food! Lucky for us they have a new Scottsdale location where the most dangerous situation you could encounter might be a hungover Scottsdale ""clubber"" (who could scratch you with their Ed Hardy bling). The only suggestion I have for them is to drop the prices about 25%"
4,"My friend who I was visiting and I went here for a fundraiser type of a deal.  I dont know what I was expecting but I really liked the island concept of the place.  My friend recommended a salad and I got a Caribbean chicken salad with some sort of coconut rice, chicken,  oranges, pineapple, tortilla strips, etc.  Well, the salad was huge!!!  The honey lime dressing was very flavorful and complimented the salad well.  We shared the rumbi fries, which were a combination of sweet and regular fries, and as aforementioned in some other reviews, I love the sweet potato fries and wish they all could have been that (do I sound like the Beach Boys?).   The decor was pretty cute and the music was great (Marley, Buffett type stuff).  The rice bowls looked fantastic, as did the sandwiches.  The prices were pretty good, considering the amount of food you received."
5,"Dr. Ellis is compasionate, caring, and really demonstrates his passion for what he does. The entire staff made us feel comfortable from the moment we walked in to the time we left the office. They went the extra step to make sure my 5 year old was having fun at the dentist! I would recommend this office to anyone who has children. Dr. Ellis and his team are the best!"
5,"Id been hearing about Defalcos for a while now. My husband, Jim W, and my youngest, Abby, raved. ""Best steak grinda since Baston,"" they said. So, on an expedition to get more raw chocolate, we went. The first thing I noticed was that the tables were scattered among the racks of Italian foodstuffs. I loved that. The place screamed ""Boston"" from the moment we walked in the door. When we ordered, Jim found one of my favorite types of soda in the case, Doc Browns diet black cherry. I was in heaven. So we got our number and sat down. While we were waiting - a short wait - I got a brilliant idea which solved a long-vexing problem. Guess it was the east coast vibe. The food came and I was in heaven. We split a steak sandwich and red potato salad. Jim likes everything and I just like onions so they gave him the mushrooms and peppers on the side. Lots of mushrooms and peppers. It didnt look like a ton of food but we certainly got enough to eat. Whats not to like at Defalcos? The food is fabulous, the prices are good, the people are really nice, and they have all kinds of imported goodies. So I guess the only thing I didnt like about Defalcos was leaving."
5,"Went wed nite, wife tells me best gnocchi since Europe, were cooked perfectly . I had pollo erbe, terrific.  "" wine tasting director"" very good, with tasty selections. Will be back, OFTEN. Highly recommend. Rich D"
5,"I had a great experience with this company today.  They sent out their tech Steve to fix my Samsung tv.  He arrived on time and was able to quickly diagnose and fix the problem.  He also provided some helpful tips to improve the performance of the tv in other areas unrelated to the issue. The service was professional, prompt, and efficient.  I would definitely use them again in the future."
1,"After reading all the good reviews, we were looking forward to eating here, but we were a bit apprehensive due to the couple of bad reviews because of the smell. Bummer...the smell just killed it for us right from the get go. Immediately, upon walking in the door, the pungent smell of backed up sewer hit us like a ton-of-bricks. We did a 180 and walked right out. No way I could sit through a meal here while breathing that funk.  Get the smell worked out and we will give you another shot, Tasty Thai."
5,"Had to update because weve now tried the pizza! For all the times we have visited weve never tried a pizza (too many other really good options to choose I guess...) We ordered the Italian Classic (veggies & meat). We ordered it a little well done/crispy and were not disappointed! It was hot, fresh and cooked perfectly!  Service was great as usual even though they were completely SLAMMED with customers the day before Thanksgiving filing numerous growlers of their pumpkin beer which sold out in less than record time! We were there again last weekend for the football games and made it in time to order our favorite breakfast items - eggs benedict and the braised pork dish with beans, potatoes, two eggs and fresh warm tortillas.  It was fantastic! This dish, just like many others (possibly ALL others) is plenty for 2 to share.  Service was exceptional and the crowd fun and rowdy rooting for their teams and AZ won - so there were a lot of happy customers that day!"
2,"So, I went because of all the hype. Immediately, realized how overrated it was. The ambiance is like a Chilis but trying to be mexican."
4,I loved it. The salad bar is not so great but everything else is excellent!
5,"They had Kool Aid! i was so happy to see it :) The chicken and waffles were really good... my girlfriend and I went straight there from the airport, before going to our hotel, and it was completely worth it...  yeah, waiting outside in 100 degree heat isnt ideal, but for 10 minutes you can deal with it... especially when they had someone outside giving out water If youre ever in Phoenix like us, or live out there, definitely stop in!!!"
1,"Went last night to Whore Foods to get basics to make pizza with, most clutch to the process was a three pack of yeast. Low and behold, the dirty hippie kids they have working there again didnt put something in the bag. And this time it was the yeast. I love the food there, but the employees are nothing more than entitled hippie kids from Scottsdale who cant be bothered to do their goddamn jobs! I am so sick of this crap with this corporation. Maybe its a Phoenix thing, or maybe its the hiring and firing processes of Whore Foods, but I am done shopping at any Whore Foods. In a place like Phoenix, where you have alternatives such as Sprouts, youd think Whore Foods would smarten up. Or when you try to ask someone who works here where something is, and they just walk by with their nose high in the air. I understand its important to show your fellow dirt merchants that youre a super star, but I dont work with you, I contribute to your salary and over inflated set of benefits for a grocery clerk, so do your goddamn job. Useless little girl in need of a shower and orthodontist.  But alas, Whore Foods and its dirty hippie employees have alienated yet another person with a job and a degree into hating everything that place stands for. Oh yea, one other thing, take the concealed firearm prohibition off of your stores. It didnt stop Jared Loughner from doing something horrid, and all it does is alienate law abiding citizens from their Constitutional rights. I understand you think that only parts of the Constitution should apply, but honestly I think you need to pull your collective heads out of your ass and take a shower. Useless motherf*&#$@s!"
1,"I recently had a shit cleaned at the Intercontinental Hotel in Hong Kong. Not cheap. I only mention that because this place charged MORE to clean that suit - almost $30 for a two-piece suit after they tacked on their $6 ""designer brand"" surcharge (no, I am not kidding). Despite branding as ""green"" the suit still reeked of solvent (the green, silica-based solvents have never left an odor in my experience). No differentiation to justify these absurd prices - a lot of good alternatives in the area. Be warned!"
4,"This would typically be a 3 star review, but it gets another star for the following: * Great air conditioning * Arizonas only Neiman Marcus * Hilarious people watching * Great happy hour haunts in the basement * Everyone here has a better tan than I do   Scottsdale Fashion Square is large and in charge and is definitely a sprawling spectacle to see at least once.   Theres no denying that its a local institution -- even if the store mix is a bit too pricey and exclusive for some."
3,"I usually get the Arizona Smashchicken or the Arizona Cobb Salad.  Both are always delicious!  Sometimes they are really spicy and other times not so much.  I guess it depends on who is making it and how many jalapenos get in there.   The chicken is really flavorful, unlike a lot of other chicken sandwiches/salads where the chicken is bland and adds nothing to the meal.  I think I am the only person I know that isnt a fan of the Smashfries.  They are generally tasty, but I would far prefer regular fries.  I really like this place, but its a little pricey for what you get.  Lunch for two will probably set you back a least $20... its not too bad, but your $20 will go a lot further other places."
5,"Always consistent. Great service, great carne asada and a pleasant patio on a beautiful day."
5,"Bad ass, just like the name.  Ive heard that this facility doesnt have any water restrictions so their course is lush & in tip top shape.  Its definitely a challenging course.  The staff is nice and the current off season rate is  $35 for residents!  You have to check it out, its a great deal."
3,"On a recent visit to Arizona, my mother and I ventured into this store. Neither of us had stepped foot in it before, even though she lives a mile away.  The aisles are broken out by cuisine, and the selection was awesome.  I was particularly surprised by the Holland, Dutch, Brazilian, and British aisle, in market classified as Asian. Very unexpected. I bet they would be more business if they boasted to be more international.  I really liked this place, but the word needs to get out about Lee Lees.  If more people shop, they will restock their shelves more often, and most items wont be so close to their expiration date.  Final points: - check expiration dates before purchasing - Generally clean but the shelved items needed to be dusted and straightened, especially the aisle with dishes. They were all over the place and had to hunt for matching bowls.  Its a market, not a dollar store - If you can get past the initial fish smell, you wont be disappointed."
4,"In my book Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks are on the top tier of the coffee shop pyramid. Because this Dunkin Donuts is a couple hundred feet north of Starbucks in this Wal-Mart power center, this location is the opportune review to compare the strengths and weaknesses of each chain using characteristics of these locations. FOOD    Dunkin Donuts blows Starbucks out of the Phoenix Valley when it comes to food. Whereas I am a fan that goes back to my teen years of Dunkin Donuts toasted bagels with cream cheese, I regard Starbucks bagels as filler food that tastes equivalent to a supermarket bagel. Dunkin Donuts signature donuts are the bomb. Starbucks pastries are filling yet forgettable. COFFEE     Long before Starbucks landed on New York soil in the 90s, Dunkin Donuts coffee was the ultimate cup of Joe. In a way Dunkin Donuts is still the ultimate cup of Joe. In my mind their coffee is slightly better than Starbucks. Especially with their added light blueberry syrup. PRICE    Dunkin Donuts coffee is relatively the same price as Starbucks. Whether I buy a coffee with syrup or ice blended coffee beverage at Dunkin Donuts or Starbucks, the difference in price is relatively zilch. SERVICE    Dunkin Donuts trails behind Starbucks in service. Especially at these locations. At Dunkin Donuts, one man was manning the shop. If there was a rush in business, this would cause customer service issues. On the other hand Starbucks had a crew of employees. The woman who took my order was very charming and friendly. Dunkin Donuts service does have one advantage over Starbucks, which is the employees put in the cream and sugar for you. COFFEE SHOP EXPERIENCE   As far as a place to hang out, Dunkin Donuts trails far behind Starbucks. This is another Dunkin Donuts where the subliminal message is to sip your coffee eat your food and move on. Starbucks on the other hand promotes hanging out with complimentary WiFi and comfortable seating."
5,"Fuego Bistro is one of my new favorites! A couple people have recommended it to me, so my boyfriend and I decided to try it for restaurant week.  We arrived about 15 minutes before our reservation to have a drink on the patio. The staff was super welcoming and friendly. Matt enjoyed a mai tai and I had a red sangria - both very refreshing. Our table was ready right on time and we had an awesome waitress who gave great suggestions on ordering... there were so many good looking options on their restaurant week menu. Were sharers, so we ordered with that in mind.  Drinks:  We got the pomegranate mojito (very refreshing) and a peach-blood orange mojito (sweet, but very good) Starters:  Signature empanadas: Tasty. The focus was the meat, I would have preferred more vegetables inside. Sauteed prawns: The star here were the sauces - delicious! Entrees:  Cola Braised Short Ribs: AMAZING! Some of the best weve ever had. The short ribs were very tender and not fatty at all. The flavor was so good! Pernil Asado (shredded pork): So delicious!! I made little tacos with their fresh corn tortillas.  Sides:  Green chili cornbread casserole: A little drier than I had imagined, but great flavor.  Maple chiliglazed carrots: The glaze didnt really stand out to me, but good as far as baby carrots go. Jalapeno creamed corn: I was pleasantly surprised - really enjoyed this one!  Chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes: A great side with the short rib.  Dessert: (By this point, we knew wed need to be rolled out of the restaurant, but we HAD to have dessert since it was part of restaurant week).  Chocolate chip bread pudding: Really good chocolate chip bread with scoops of malted chocolate crisp ice cream. This was a lot of food after that meal, but I savored the bites I had. The ice cream was excellent! Banana burrito: exactly what youd picture with scoops of the same icecream - delicious!  I cant wait to go back to Fuego and tell my friends about it. Great service, charming atmosphere, and excellent dishes.... Fuego is a winner!"
4,"Food is great.  Best Thai in West Valley.  Always get takeout so not sure about the service, but takeout is always ready when they say it will be ready.  The atmosphere is quiet and cozy - about a dozen to fifteen tables or so.  Place always seems clean when I pick my food up and has the type of decor youd expect to see in a Thai restaurant.   I usually get red chicken or beef curry hot, and my wife gets green curry mild.  The food is excellent.  Their egg rolls arent very greasy like most places.  Spring rolls are also made fresh to order with fresh veggies.  The only thing is, sometimes the spiciness of the curry will be spicier some days and not as spicy others.  Other than that, this place is great."
4,"I am so sorry I didnt come here sooner! This is a great sports bar not far from our house. The service was very friendly, and the killer wings (they also have honey BBQ) were awesome. They had tons of meat on them, which isnt always the case with wings, as I am sure most of you can attest. We also had the margherita pizza, which was pretty tasty. There were numerous TVs scattered throughout the restaurant, and they had $1 beers (yes $1) when we were there - fantastic deal! This place is definitely more chill than Fox Sports Grill (not quite as fancy or upscale), but its a perfect sports watching or beer drinking venue nonetheless.  Oh, and they deliver!!!!!! Good choice if you live in North Scottsdale."
1,"Heres the 1. 2. 3... 1. Great Food. I love hot New Mexico style food. Good job. 2. They have a little brewery and make 3 house beers. Unfortunately, theyre all shitty. 3. They could REALLY improve the service. No Bueno!  Well be back for the food. It might be take out next time though! 4-17-11 Update: Some asshole who was clearly affiliated with Arribas contacted me via private message to slam me for my review. I hope the yelp police find you and pull you off the site. More importantly, I hope more people read my review and stay away from this restaurant. Good Food folks, just get it to go! To Bryan L. and the rest of the gang over at Arribas....Go EFF yourselves! You get one star and NO more of my money!!!!!!! Learn how to work, Kid!"
1,"The office space, layout, presentation gets 5 stars, the customer service you receive from the employees at Corporate Office Center is a negative 10. They will scare your clients off, scare your own staff and make your life a living hell. Their office locations and space is beautiful but if a say, a client shows up at a time other than their scheduled time, they will be told to leave. They will be told you dont provide any services at the locations and if anyone could single handedly ruining your professional image, Corporate Office Centers can do this for you! BE AFRAID!!!! They are dedicated to working against, not with you."
4,"Its usually a ghost town at the downtown Phoenix bars, but when a game and/or concert is happening, suddenly the bars are bustling. Such was the case last night at Majerles, former Phoenix Suns player Dan Marjerles sports bar. With the Beyonce concert across the street at the arena AND a D-backs game at the ball park, Phoenix was a hoppin. My friend and I stopped into Majerles, which Ive been to a few times before, for dinner and drinks before going to see Beyonce. I had a cheeseburger and Cesar Salad. While I realize its hard to mess up a Cesar Salad, my salad was seriously the best Cesar Ive ever had. And my burger was packed with flavor. No wonder AOL  named them Best Burgers two years in a row. We also had a wonderful chocolate martini (with Vanilla Vodka, not creme based) here. And on Fridays if youre in the mood to really start the night, the bar offers a Corona or Pacifico with a shot of tequila for $7 as part of their Sizzlin Friday special. My only complaint was that our waitress suddenly went M.I.A for about 15 minutes when we were trying to close our tab so we could go to the show.  But Im still going to cut them some slack because this is one of a few fun places to drink in the downtown area. HOT TIP: A second Majerles will be opening in Chandler in the fall."
4,Decent BBQ food but nothing to scream about... but be prepared to have a TON of food to eat.
5,"Wine, booze and cigars. And friendly staff. Theres not much else that needs to be said. Oh and great prices. The selection and prices they offer are great. The aisles are wide and clearly marked. The cigar room has a great selection as well and the prices are low."
4,"After my sixth or so visit here at Big Earls I have to give them a four plus rating. My first time here was opening night and it was ok...the second time was improved...third time good...etc. Now when I come in the smoke is starting to impermiate in the walls leaving a wonderful smokey resonance in the dining room, and the food has become exponentially better!!! I am like most people in the serious dining population, a lover of all things pork. And while they do some real good pig here, I am thrice impressed with the beef offerings! I like to judge a restaurant on the dishes I would absolutely return for, and the brisket is for sure that item here. Actually, the beef ribs are also one of those ""return for"" items as well. They, much like the brisket, are perfectly smokey, wonderfully seasoned, and impossibly tender. I highly suggest either one. As for the sides, I can honestly recommend the collards, potato salad, and the Mac and cheese...although its not a creamy Mac, but it is gooey enough to pass my palates stamp of approval.  A huge selling point for me when I dine out are the drink specials, or selection. They are GREAT here!!! Being a total whisky slut, I am in heaven here, with dozens of delicious options, and the handful of beers on tap here make me happy for the change in libation after a few too many. Try the front porch cocktail, one of my top five here in town. Big Earls has proven that with time, all things become better. Like I said before, each separate visit has been more fulfilling than the last. I can only imagine how the experience will be, come summer and autumn, my guess is pretty damn amazing!"
4,The food was good and all prepared as I waited.  Looks like a long list of wide ranging bad foods that make you feel so good!
3,"Good salad options. It is definitely tough to mess up lettuce and veggies.  As for the rest of the selection, we must have just come on a bad night. The pasta was overcooked and mushy, not even close to al dente.  Fresh fruit selection consisted of only 3 fruits, not exactly a vast selection.  If you want a good salad, definitely the place to go."
5,"As good as all the others, and closer to home than most."
5,"I am a huge ""foodie"", from a long line of ""foodies"". I grew up living in hotels and on room service and fine dining. This is the best, very best, breakfast restaurant EVER! I have been living in Tempe for about six years now, the first two sad sad years I did not know that this wonderful place existed...after my first visit, this is my go-to, best place to recommend, favorite breakfast place to eat at! If you go on a Sunday, it will be very very busy. Everyone is super friendly. The place is very clean. Prices are amazing! Cheaper or as cheap as the nasty breakfast places or fast food. Huge portions and great quality food. I have never had a bad experience here, and to be honest...even if I did, I wouldnt care. I feel like home here. Everything on the menu is delicious! Ive tried almost everything. Here are a few of my favorites (dont forget though, I love it all) : OPear Grenache Omelette, Greek Fetash Omelette, English Harvest Omelette, Huevos Con Chorizo (with scrambled eggs), and the Blueberry Hill Girdle Cakes (pancakes! you can order half an order or little ones...we always get an order to share at the table). Their potatoes are delicious and crispy, the english muffins are great and their homemade jam is absolutely amazing! I have bought many jars of their jam to give as gifts! Just delicious! I wish everyone knew about this well kept secret. DONT LISTEN TO ANY REVIEW UNDER A 5 STAR! This place is the best, bottom line. Try it. You will be hooked."
5,"We went on a Friday night and even though it is off season here, the place was packed. Never the less, the service was impeccable as always. This is our third trip here and we have never been disappointed. I had the 14 Oz. NY strip and my wife had the prime rib. Both were cooked to perfection and seasoned ever so  wonderfully! My wife tells me the horseradish is the real deal and not the runny stuff you get elsewhere...cant vouch as I hate the stuff.  From the bread to the desert, every bite was worth taking. The old time ambiance with the dark wood and red ""leather""? booths are welcoming. Its pricey and if you can ignore the geek with khakis, no socks and deck shoes ever so gently cradling his wine...(you KNOW the guy and he is everywhere) in the middle of a Phoenix summer, it is worth every single cent."
4,"Looking for something refreshing to escape this crazy AZ heat? Ritas may be your answer!  I stopped by yesterday with Lindsey F, and was pleasantly surprised by all of the unique flavors of ice and custard to choose from: Swedish Fish? Check! (and it tastes exactly like the candy).  Lemonade, Cherry, Mango? Check, Check, Check!  I ended up taking home a quart of half lemonade and half cherry.  My husband and I dug into it last night. Next time Ill have to try the custard... or perhaps the Sour Patch Kid flavor that is coming out this week!  Mmmm!"
2,I have gone here quite a few times. I like having a diner close by for breakfast and newspaper reading. But this one is always short staffed. And there doesnt seem to be much management around to smooth things out. Food is usually good but staff always seems stressed out. May be due to serving hoards of poor tipping elderly.
4,"This place has apparently been open for about 2-3 weeks.  I headed here with some co-workers for a late Friday ""meeting"".  Otherwise known as happy hour!  They have a good selection of beer on draft and bottle.  I had a New Belgium Super IPA that they had on draft and one of their sausages(Chicken and Apple) topped with some sauerkraut and mustard.  It was quite a good combination and was recommended by our server. If youre looking for food, then you may be disappointed in the small amount of options, however, when you realize that their kitchen is the size of a small closet, it kind of makes sense.  With the cooler weather right on the horizon here in the valley, their very large patio area should come in quite handy. I will definitely try them out again."
4,"WOWSA- we just moved here from NYC and this pizza is like home :)  We tried the Brooklyn and Da Works  pies and the Brooklyn was WAY BETTER. I didnt like the Da Works (dont care for fresh tomatoes on top of my pizza).   This will be our regular pizza joint for the area- we were both impressed and will order many more Brooklyn pizzas from NYPD! Having just moved from NYC we can speak with authority when we say ""Its authentic NY pizza!"""
3,"Gracies is a small thrift store with decent items.  The prices are a little less than you would pay at Goodwill.  You can get a pair of jeans for about $5.  If you need a belt, this would be a good place to go, only $2.  I didnt find anything to buy for myself, but we found a new pair of shorts for my son.  Only $2.50.   Just an FYI, it costs $0.75 to use your debit card."
5,"New owners are awesome!!!!!  Good people, earnest in providing a great product with great service.  The restaurant is beautiful too.  My mouth starts watering right when I walk in the door.  Go check them out!!!!"
5,"Lives up to the local fuss. Quick, cheap, tasty and one of the few fast Mexican food restaurants that utilize yellow cheese, which is my cardinal rule of good Mexican food."
5,Apparently fellow yelper Andrew and I are meeting in our dreams over maple bacon creme brulee! Im seriously glad to see that I am not the only one having subconcious yearnings for this lil dab of heaven in a cup! All of the products are top notch though and who doesntlike creme brulee? Communists maybe? Chef Eric is awesome and so friendly too.
4,Just got back from Carlsbad Tavern.  It was good.  Great service.  Fun atmosphere. Kid friendly.  Loved their black beans.  My husband loved his fish taco salad.  I liked my meal.  I wasnt excited about my food like my husband was.  My only suggestion to them would be to add more vegetarian options without relying on cheese.
4,"This could possibly be 5 stars. Driving by you would never know this restaurant serves excellent Italian food. It is rather small and has a very different decor from other Scottsdale restaurants. I went on a Friday night and there were not many people there and I have walked by on other weekend nights and it was the same result.  Regardless of that the food was outstanding. I ordered a special, lobster risotto and it was superb. There are many other things on the menu which I would like to try as well. It is rather expensive, but well worth it. The service was also very quick, and it should be when there are not many people dining."
4,This place is similar to Rays on 3rd St. It was lunch time I had an eggplant parm sub very good the eggplant was nicely breaded not gooey and gross. The kid had a slice of cheese the slices are HUGE. The pizza and service here are always good. I suggest this place for dinner more so the meals are way better they come with a house salad and they have more options pasta and such. They deliver too.
2,"Ive had dinner there a couple of times.   The bar is great and the drinks are OK.  The outdoor patio looks comfy and inviting.  It has a large outdoor fireplace.  The inside atmosphere is busy but fun.  The food is always good.  Fish and steak tacos are fantastic.  The macaroni and cheese is one of the best i have ever had and my brother who was visiting from Kansas almost O.D.d on  the stuff.  My only issue would the lack of an obvious manager on the floor or presence of any hierarchy.  Also the lack of hats in the kitchen bothered me a little so dont look if that bothers you also.   Stopped going back, very erratic dining experience.  Over- priced and extremely uneven service.  The wait staff seems completely untrained and unaware."
2,"We arrived at 7:00, had a party of six, and were able to be seated within 15 minutes. Fabulous, considering the number of hungry people coming into the restaurant that evening, but we have always had good luck getting right into Grimaldis, regardless of the location. The new Scottsdale Quarter location has great ambience and service going for it, but I was sorely disappointed by the quality of the pizza. One of the reasons my partner and I keep going back to the Old Town location is for the consistently tasty crust: crisp and thin, yet chewy and moist as well. Our pizza last night had a thicker crust and too well done, by comparison. Maybe the QC will improve as time goes on--Im sure well be back to see."
5,"PHENOMENAL place for Chinese cuisine. The portions are HUGE! My fiance and I always only order one thing and share it, and still always have leftovers. The menu prices are very reasonable. Including tip, we usually dont spend more than $15 for the both of us for dinner. They are very personable and attentive to your needs. I love that it is a very dainty, and has a very laid back atmosphere. The lemon chicken is our favorite!! :) They are also very kid friendly. We have an 18 month old son who always leaves a nice pile of rice on the floor every time we leave lol, but they love him! Highly recommend!"
5,"Japanese chefs, top notch sashimi, affordable neighborhood sushi place! 5/5 Id lived in Japan before and this place can beat those in Tokyo! If you go to Hiro, you have to order their sashimi. We always order scallops sashimi, yellow tail, salmon, toro sashimi and uni (sea urchin)! Their rolls are amazing too. All sashimi comes in a big-fat-lap portion! Very fresh! The service is great too."
5,"No matter where you go in the World if you are wearing an in and out shirt or hat some big guy usually yells out ""In and Out Man I love that place"" I think that says it all."
4,"great beer, great food, great prices and its haunted!!!"
1,"Very unpleasant experience. Creepy male doctor. Uncaring. And no help. I went to this Urgent Care with a swollen ankle so painful that I was nauseous, dizzy and having vision problems. The doctor interrogated me and advised me to get my head examined. Im not kidding.  Mom was right: good doctors dont advertise. This place actually solicits Yelp reviews."
4,"The boyfriend and I went here on a Sunday morning hung over from Four Lokos.  The food was fucking great and I dont even like breakfast food.  I got this egg and jalapeno burrito thing with this sort of runny but generally pretty tasty salsa and I wanted to shower in the burrito filling.  I would have bathed in eggs and salsa if only to prolong my experience with this semi-breakfast burrito thing.  I would have married it and had kids with it and bought a house in Michigan nearby a really good school district.  I fell in love with the egg jalapeno burrito thing, I would cuddle with it on weekday mornings and plan trips to national parks with it.   It was also nice sitting on the patio considering the weather is so pretty and the staff was attentive and friendly and slightly charming with their loafers and novelty socks (is that part of the required uniform I wonder?) Im deducting one star for the sheer fact that this place was filled with rich, middle aged white yuppies talking about golfing and/or glued to their cell phone.  The boyfriend and I, being young dirty Mesa kids still slightly intoxicated off Four Lokos, felt mildly out of place in this setting and were a little over whelmed by the amount of yuppie whiteness. Nonetheless, the food was worth the trip and the cozy patio on a Sunday morning was a nice change from, you know, Cheerios on the futon while watching exercise equipment infomercials."
1,"Not worth comin here. Im all for food like this but this restaurant sucks. They gave me and my dad the wrong meal, and the food was not that good. The meat was dry and the rice was cold. Not worth it."
3,"Ive only eaten the buffet here and it was good but nothing special.  To be fair, most Indian buffets are pretty similar, its only when you order from the menu that you see if the restaurant is really a stand-out.  So, I will update this review when Ive gone there for dinner"
4,"Tough to rank this place...   it is a retirement community first off.   The club house is awesome.   Pool is salt water and heated.   Courses are nice, little bit of a challenge but basically flat.   The putt putt course is very challenging and really cool.    Im not impressed at all with the club food and suggest staying away from the roast beef.   It seemed fake."
3,"First time there the other night.  Friday night, not very crowded for 7:30pm.  We were shown to a table in what looked like a back room - the table was not set, there was just a tablecloth and that was it.  The room is to the right as you walk in.  There were only 2 other tables in there and the windows were covered (no view) - it was weird so I immediately asked to be seated in the main part of the restaurant.  Decor seemed cheap - just my initial impression.  Food was pretty good.  Pancetta wrapped shrimp app was good; Service was good.  Entrees were pretty good - Chicken Parm, Fettucine Bolognese all tasty, but not sure I would go back.  Caesar salad was a bit disappointing...asked for anchovies on the side - never delivered."
5,"I have only gotten the cafe sua da (iced coffee) here but its the best I have had yet. When you walk in there is always fresh coffee lined up in cups on the counter ready to be mixed with sweetened condensed milk. I dont get to Mesa often but when I do I go here for the wonderful, rich, dark and creamy coffee. This is strong stuff; that first sip is so good. The richness, full flavor, creamy caramel flavors are heavenly.  And as the ice melts, it mellows out the flavor a little and its still great. I cant say I have had all the cafe sua da in the valley, but what I have had; this is my favorite.  Next time I come to Mesa for work I will need to come at lunch time so I can try the pho."
4,I tried Narai when my family was in town; everyone enjoyed their meal. They have a wide variety of Thai food and sushi and a full bar. Our servers were very attentive.  I had the tofu pad thai with medium spice (which is still pretty spicy). It had a nice flavor to it. and enough of a portion to take leftovers home for lunch. My sister really enjoyed her papaya salad and thai soup and my parents liked the cashew chicken - the sauce had a great flavor.  There arent a ton of Thai restaurants in North Scottsdale... Id say this one is a very solid pick.
5,"Exactly what a hole in the wall Pho place should be like! Totally reminds me of LA, SF or any authentic Pho place in any multi-cultural city. Congrats Phoenix for not being completely white bred and redneck- must give thanks to center city. Anyhow, portions are large, ingredients taste fresh and prices are inexpensive. If youre one of the sheltered folk out here that gets freaked out by rude bums or the lack of decor- stay in the shelter of your HOA tract home or go to the mall."
3,"I took my family here using a groupon and it was just ok.  We tried to go on Monday however we arrived at 4:30 and the employee working the counter informed us that league play was going to begin at 5:30 so our hour would be cut short.  I was a little irritated with her ""um, yeah sorrry"" but whatever.  We opted to come back the next day to get our full hour.  When we arrived we were greeted by a very friendly gentlemen who provided us our shows and assigned our lane.  We were one of 3 groups in the alley and they placed us side by side instead of giving us a little space.  My wife asked for a glass of water that never came.  So the bowling was fun.  The service was marginal at best.  The lane assignment was awful.  Since we only paid $15 for 4 people for the hour including shoe rental I will go back again for the same deal.  I would never go there paying full price which is outrageous."
5,"My work got some Christmas allowance and instead of doing a dinner we decided to get a really nice lunch for our branch. We decided on Oreganos cause it was on the way.  I had the stuffed Italian sandwich and it blew my mind. I couldnt believe how bug this sandwich was, it provided me with two wonderful lunches.  It looks like some of my coworkers got the sausage sandwich and the steak sandwich and one person got a pasta dish and couldnt even eat a quarter of it because they gave so much.  After that experience I am going to make more of an effort to get to the restaurant instead of getting it to go."
5,"This is our DEFAULT happy hour. I wont be reviewing their dinner as I have never had an actual meal there. Im not really a beer drinker, but they have such a big selection, I always find something i like. And Ive been told they have a martini specials, but you dont go to a beer place and get martinis... come on. Pretty much their entire appetizer selection (which is what, 20 items?) is on the half price happy hour menu. You know what that means? Four sliders and fries for FOUR dollars. (Also recommended... Hawaiian Poke Stack). In summary, I can wrap up Yard House in two words. Heck. Yes."
5,"Ive been Dr. Castillas office for 7 years.  Her office has relocated and her practice has grown over the years and for good reason.  She is a Dr. that treats you as a person and takes her time to honestly answer your questions.  She makes eye contact with you and I couldnt ask for anything more.  Just remember, it is a large practice and the staff is sometimes questionable.  But, shes worth the wait!   Now that weve relocated, I hate to give up Dr. Castilla.  Shes irreplaceable!"
3,"Chicago style hot dog?!  Sign me up!  I just moved here from Chicago, and Ive been dreaming of Portillos since I left.  Where am I going to find something even close to that in AZ?!  I was hoping this would be it.  The hot dog wasnt that bad.  The fries on the other hand, werent so good.  My husband ordered a beef with hot peppers (giardiniera), and they were far from hot...almost tasted pickled.  And the sandwich?  TINY!!!  It was like a 4"" beef sandwich!  I didnt taste it, but he said that it just tasted like a roast beef sammy...not the Chicago beef that we are used to.  One of these days well find a decent ""Chicago-style"" restaurant out here in AZ."
4,"They had me at Baked.Goat.Cheese.   The appetizers were phenomenal, we got the Bake Goat Cheese that came with their freshly baked brick oven bread and my bf got the Romaine salad with fuji apple & bacon.  But the baked cheese was by far the better of the two. Main courses also didnt disappoint we ordered the white fish and hanger steak.  I only had a bite of the fish so I cant speak that much to it, the bf enjoyed it.. it had too much lemon in the sauce for me, but I hate lemon flavoring so its probably better to take his word for it!   The steak had this amazing sauce that accompanied it that added such a nice flavor to compliment the steak.  Both entrees were pretty good size portions, especially after appetizers. And we also split a side of sweet corn polenta that we couldnt finish The actual restaurant its self is very open, there is an outside covered patio and a smaller patio for the bar thats out in the open.   Valet only, complementary Sat Night wait time: approx 20 mins Clientele: On Sat night we had a big table of your typical Scottsdale Cougars, average couples and groups ranging from mid 20s to 60s and a bachelorette party of 4 girls who were barely 21 (not the typical place for a bachelorette party)"
5,"My house has never been this clean EVER!!! I am thrilled with the level of service and professionalism expressed by the women who cleaned my house today! I bought a Living Social coupon, and I am so glad I found this company. 5 women arrived and fully cleaned my house in 45 minutes. The women were friendly to me and especially my dog, which is the sign of a wonderful company, if you ask me. I am hoping I am able to use this service on a monthly basis. Angela scheduled my appointment immediately when I let her know I had company coming in town, and the cleaners arrived during the scheduled time. I am thrilled with the results!"
4,"Ihappened by during their soft open, and I was very impressed with the food. They have a great selection of meats and they are cooked perfectly. They even give you choices of regular or moist briskit (a little fattier to give it more flavor). They have a good house barbeque sauce.   The facility is pretty simple - very ""bar"" atmsphere and TVs along the walls. The staff is great, and eager to make sure you enjoy the food. Ill be coming back."
1,"Our bartender was rude and impersonal, to start. When my wife ordered a diet coke, you could see her disdain. We saw her once more, when she took our food order, after which she sat in the corner and ate. The remaining staff dropped off our food without a word, and never came back; in fact, I had to flag down the manager to get cashed out. The food was sub par. My wifes Shepard pie was all mashed potatoes, and my chicken strips were incorrect and with the wrong side. Also, my fries were soggy because they had been placed over excess sauce.  Poor food, awful service, overpriced beer. Visit the Kyrene location or dont go at all."
2,"Came here one morning a couple of weeks ago.  Had about 50 minutes alloted before my Mayo clinic appointment, so I thought a short stack of banana-nut pancakes would get me in and out fast.  I thought wrong.  Staff was friendly enough, but it took at least 10 minutes for the server to finally take my order.  I asked for banana-nut pancakes, but instead of the pancake syrup (not pure maple), I wanted a side of the blueberry compote that usually comes w/ the blueberry pancakes.  Would this be OK?  Server said yes.  The short stack (2 cakes) arrived 15 minutes later, but instead of banana-nut pancakes, these were blueberries, delivered by another server.  My server came by to ask if I needed anything else, heard my complaint, and rushed back to the kitchen to correct it.  I was assured that it would only take 10 minutes to get a fresh batch out, but another 15 minutes went by before the correct order arrived.  Keep in mind, its already been at least 40 minutes since I sat down.  I only had 10 minutes to spare- not enough to savor these delicious cakes.  The blueberry compote ended up containing corn syrup, the ingredient I was trying to avoid by not using the pancake syrup, but its hard for me to resist blueberry compote, so if I must suffer... I most likely will visit Chompies again the next time Im out and about and craving for pancakes, but only if I have 90 minutes or more to spare..."
5,Great home made taste on the meatballs.  Also they have diet coke.  Shop was nice and clean.  Friendly and fast service
5,If I were to ever get hooked on crack... I would want my crack to be these amazing donuts! They are delicious and addicting.
4,"Nice resort located next to the Desert Ridge shopping complex.  If youre from out of town, this would be a great place to stay since youll be across the street from a ton of restaurants and bars. I went to an event here, and haved stayed here a few times.  JW Marriott has hosted a few wine tastings that Ive gone to, and the resort is super nice, with a staff that is ready and waiting to help you no matter what it is you need. The rooms were decently sized and the bed was big and comfy.  The bathroom was nice as well.   The resort has a lot of fountains around and huge windows so you can check out the great views. The pool area is where its at though.  They have a great lazy river to nurse your hangover on, and a water slide for when youre feeling better.  Of course you can get drink and food service out there and you can even rent a cabana- which I recommend.   Its not that pricey- around $100, so if you get a few people to go in with you, its no biggie smalls. The servers are way more attentive to you when you have a cabana and you can choose different packages that come with water and fruit or lunch and so on."
4,"Is this great sushi?  No.  Does this food reinvent the sushi wheel?  Not even close.  Will I have a foodgasm?  Not a chance. When I am craving an amazing sushi meal, Ill go to Yasu. Why I really, REALLY like Teharu: The food is fresh.  While its not amazing fish, theres nothing wrong with it - nothing here to get sick from. All the standards are readily available and if you want something not already on the belt, theyll gladly make it for you. The conveyor really feeds into my lack of patience.  I sat down, ordered an iced green tea, and started pulling plates off the belt.  Yes, I was eating sushi within 90 seconds of sitting down! The price is a HUGE plus!  I met a friend for lunch - we each had iced tea, several plates with 3 or 4 roll slices, seaweed salad, sunumono salad and a couple nigiri and I was out of there for less than $20, including tip. The place is kept incredibly clean, staff is friendly and Teharu fills a nice niche for a super casual, quick sushi place.  When it comes down to it, I cant always afford to spend what that quantity of food would cost me at Yasu or any of the other great places in town - I like that I am not committing to a whole roll - I can sample from 5 or 6 different ones. Fills the need for the sushi craving on a buget and/or when strapped for time."
5,"LOVE THIS PLACE!  We eat here every Saturday as long as we are in town.  My husband eats here during the week too!  Weekday lunches are a great deal and quick!  The veggie soup is delicious.  The golden wings - Delicious... chicken satay is good too.  For an entree... we always get Pad Prik King chicken or sometimes shrimp but its always always delicious!  Have been trying to find a thai place with this dish closer to home (east valley) but havent found one yet!  Service is terrific!  FYI for those of you who just order Pad Thai... it is very sweet here so if you dont like it sweet... order something else.  Other things weve tried that were good... pepper steak - very good - just dont eat a lot of red meat, massamum curry with chicken good... also we order everything medium to thai hot... like very spicy!"
5,LOVE Five Guys!
1,Not worth the money. Food was average and the portion was small for the price I paid.
5,"This feels like a neighborhood bistro (much like the ones I have visited in New York).  The food is wonderful and the wine selection varies which I like.  My favorite dishes include:  Salmon, crab crepe, burger and ahi tartar -- but their menu changes often, so dont be surprised if you eat something you like and its not there next time."
4,Great fast service! Friendly girls that carried on fun conversations. Beautiful salon with nice pedicure chairs. Great prices too!
5,"Barrio Cafe is an amazing Mexican restaurant.  Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza travels to Mexico for many of her ingredients and you can tell - things are always fresh (they only have an ice cream freezer!), creative and authentic.  I am more than content w/ a mango margarita, the incredible guacamole and the gooey caramel filled churros!!  Even when the restaurant is packed, the staff is friendly and informative."
4,"What a great find! We purchased a deal chicken for this restaurant as we had never tried before. We had an absolutely fabulous dinner start to finish. We started with Caprese salad and stuffed mushrooms both were very good, then for entrees, we had Chicken florentina and Pasta romantico. Both sauces were the best we have had! The atmosphere is like you are in Italy. I would have never figured from the location but we will be regulars."
2,"The valet guys were absolutely awesome.  They were the best part of my stay at this hotel.   The grounds were okay - NOT 5 star quality.  The decor in the rooms seemed old, and the color scheme was dated.  Although most of the staff was friendly, we did have a pretty bad encounter with the pool manager.  My husband and I had bought a bag of popcorn at the grocery store and were snacking on it poolside.  The pool manager came up to us and informed us that outside food is not allowed in the pool area.  She told us that we needed to put our food away.  She then left without even offering the opportunity to order some Fairmont approved food.  It was really strange and off-putting.  We had been sitting by the pool for over an hour and not a single person from the wait staff had come up to us to take our drink/food orders.  Also, it seems a bit ridiculous that we cant eat our own bagged popcorn.  Its not like we were chowing down on a big meal and making a mess.  It made the resort seem elitist.  I definitely wont be staying here again. Ive stayed at the Hyatt Regency Scottsdale before and would definitely recommend that hotel over the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess."
4,"I went here for dinner last night with a group and we had excellent service. The specialty drinks were yummy and were a deal! My favorite (out of two I had tried) was the ketel-one pineapple martini! My sister had a house salad, the dressing tasted homemade, and the croutons were nice and crunchy! I had the Positano Steak Sandwich which was great, my only complaint it was a little too salty, and the fries (and I love fries) were tasty! Other people had the lasagna and they loved it. My sister had the baby back ribs and loved them. If youre looking for a pub-like restaurant that has good prices, pretty tasty food (with a good variety of items on the menu), and excellent cocktails, Keegans is your place!"
4,Great setting to enjoy good food!
4,"Had the thick crust Sicilian pepperoni 3/14/2009, took it to the drive in movies, and while it was expensive (23 bucks), it was worth it! This baby could feed 6 people, and it was pretty good as well. I wouldnt get this on a regular basis because of the price and the calories, but I think its the best pizza they have."
2,"So when you walk in, walk to the right and have the machine scan your card. Im telling you this because I looked like a douchebag because I assumed that the Bally worker would scan my card.  Oh yeah, youll smell urine.  Like, did someone just go crazy and piss all over the place? Seriously, how does a smell get so horrendous like that? What is that?  There are a lot of treadmills and theyre recent...not new...they look overused...but yeah. Im sensitive to smell... I couldnt even exercise."
1,"The 3 employees were so busy talking to each other they couldnt remember what we ordered, kept having to ask, and still didnt get it right.  In the midst of the three employees continuing in their personal chaos, my husband finally said, ""ok, time out! Im the customer.  Make our sandwiches and then take care of your issues."". They stopped for a split second, all three looked at us, then they actually IGNORED us, finished their conversation, then finished our sandwiches.  We were the only ones in there and we really were shocked!  Good thing I like avacado, because it ended up on my sandwich & I didnt order it, and after telling the girl, she said, ""I thought you said..."". Still had the order wrong!  Whew!"
3,"The Service is great.  The food is ok.  The salsa.....horrible.  Please rethink your salsa.  Oh, and if you order a side of jalapenos they charge $1.99.  I have never heard of a Mexican restaurant charging for jalapenos.  Overall, just an ok place.  There are better options on and around Mill."
5,"Id love to give this place MORE than 5 stars!!! In Phoenix a few weeks ago I needed to planb a nice dinner for a group of 10.  I thought about a few places and wanted to come here because of the view.  (Get it? Different Point of View.....?) Anyway, while I did initially pick DPOV because of the view, I fell in love with the perfect service AND the perfect menu. There were great options for my picky group, and not one person left unhappy, or hungry.  In addition, they seem to have a pre-fix menu with a nice price tag if youre ballin on a budget.   Everything was AMAZING and its definitely one of my favorite restaurants in DC!"
4,"This place is so damn tasty.  I love a good burger and I recommend this place highly.  I dont know why I didnt give it 5 stars.. 4.5?  Ok, there we go. I ordered a mushroom Swiss burger and the thing literally melted in my mouth. You have to be careful cause you could literally inhale these things in a matter of seconds.  They are that good! A big plus that his place has is that they sell fried pickles.  I dont know of another small place like this that does.  Veddddy goood.   Thankfully this place is two blocks from my house, so easy access.. lol."
3,"Pretty ok place, right in the thick of it, I saw 3 separate arrests while drinking beer on the patio.  They have a couple different 4 Peaks Brews.  Those facts alone made it a successful endeavor.  Did I mention it was 4pm on a Friday?"
2,"Meh.  Service was friendly, and the atmosphere is bright and festive, but its pretty Americanized Mexican food.  I had a California burro ($9.49), which was a large size, and tasted OK, but for about 1/3 of the price and for about the same size, I can get a better tasting burro with the same type of ingredients at Los Favoritos.  Ive also had dishes with their Baja sauce, which tends to be too heavy tasting for me."
4,"Great, challenging course.  Well maintained. Friendly staff, marshalls, etc. ""Club House"" is still a pretty-fied construction trailer, but they now have supplies, clubs, balls etc. available. The view alone is worth the round.  Unfortunately, porta-potties are only at the practise tees, holes 5 and 13, so it isnt so lady-friendly. The bar cart does make its way around, however and you are given bottled water in your cart."
5,"There are no words to express the value of the quality of service that you receive from  Tina Yraguis Hands 4 Healing  therapeutic overall body care.  The value  of knowledge of the body, the commitment of service, the excellence of research for each individual client. The degree that she possesses cannot be measured with a dollar amount because no dollar amount can beat this value. It is value what goes far beyond what you receive each and every time you see Tina.   Tina is a healer and is dedicated to you.  It just doesnt get any better! Carol Taylor-Tassone Erica Elizabeth Tassone"
4,"My girlfriend and I love Crust and frequent here often. They have amazing pizza, the Rustica is enough for two, and we usually split a salad. They have whole wheat crust, upon request, which is actually really good. There service is awesome and we always enjoy ourselves when we visit. They have a great wine selection by the glass and by the bottle. Our favorite is the red blend that is very unique, let it breathe though. They also have many flat screen tvs so you can keep up with what ever sporting event is on. The atmosphere is casual, but it can get noisy if the restaurant is full. The only time weve ever had poor food is when we do pick up. Its always been hit or miss then. Weve never had a bad experience actually visiting the restaurant, which explains the 4 out of 5 stars."
4,"Weve got another first timer here...! I am just as shocked as the next person that after many years in Seattle, I had never had Bubble Tea.  Gasp!  You can get it almost as readily as Starbucks.  I learned its also called Boba and maybe one other name.  Its all the same to me.  Same-same. I had my first boba initiation at the recent Office Hours with Gabi.  I was completely overwhelmed by the options presented to me: what type of chewies (for the record, that term just doesnt seem right), base drink, optional flavorings, etc.  It was a lot for this gal to handle.  Luckily, Alica B. was at my side leading me down the boba path.   She helped me pick out a concoction of Thai iced tea and regular boba.  Gotta start with the original boba, right?  She ended up with a coffee drink with coffee jellies.  I feel like Im now ""in the know"" because she asked for the coffee jellies and even though they werent on the menu, they indeed had them.  Thats a little insiders tip from me to you.  Wink wink.  She was so excited I thought she was going to consider this woman the Patron Saint of Boba and commence worship on the spot. I was surprised to find how incredibly filling boba is.  I wasnt hungry for hours!  Overall, it was good.  I dont see myself craving boba, but if someone wants to go, then Im in.  Ill check out the jellies in my next go round.  If the craving is boba, I would definitely recommend this place!"
2,"Terrible food. Pretentious service. Stale bread brought to table. Mole was grainy and tasteless. On the upside, great tequila selection! At least you can get loaded and pretend the dinner you just waited too long for and paid too much for was worth it."
5,"I would typically never write a review for strbucks because it is all the same.  I mean that in the best possible way as i have come to expct a certain level of service and quality.  Starbucks is amazing for kids as my dzughter oly drinks warm milk and so anywhere i see a starbucks i can ge a kids milk.  I have had  great serive at this location.  Since i could not find the starbucks at the asu bookstore location, i am using this review too but really the five stars is for this location. I wanted to give the asu location one star.  My barista NOEl today was exceptionaaly rude. She did not know how to make nor ring up a kids drink and when it  came up wrong instead of offering to fix it told me that  is how it is done.  If my other experiences weren t so good with starbucks i would have switched over to petes.  If you happen to be the starbucks manager at the asu bookstore location too, NOEL definitely could use some more training in both drink preparation and customer service. Sorry for the spelling areas but i am typing on my iphone and havent found the pellchck option yet."
3,"If Star of India (SoI) is named after the historic ship that set sail from Great Britain to India then it is best to declare at the beginning that there is nothing worth remembering about this place and there is little that keeps you afloat in the morass of ordinary fare.  Like many other Indian restaurants in the valley, the smell of Indian cooking hangs in the air and permeates every piece of furnishing. The place does not disappoint when it comes to service, it is warm, quick and attentive. The complimentary papadums (Indian flatbread) with homemade chutneys (condiments) is usually the high point of a meal at SoI.  Experiences with the order could be as follows:  Gobi Parantha (Indian bread stuffed with cauliflower)- The real thing is meant to be fluffy and served with butter but the SoI parantha resembles a topping-less thin crust pizza.  Lamb korma- The gravy is thick, nutty with a lot of authentic flavours but the meat tastes pre-cooked.  Chicken biriyani- it is difficult to describe the God-food that is biryani but SoI manages to serve a new variation which is nothing more than chicken pieces thrown into a mishmash of rice and vegetables.  Disheartenment with the over-priced, sub-standard food could lead to a decision of not ordering dessert.  Finally, as observed in other reviews and the menu, if you visit this place then stick with the tandoori stuff and Chefs specialities. However in that case the excitement of an extensive menu will be lost."
5,Had lunch at Bliss again ... still yummy as always! This time I had the ceasar salad and their shoe string  parmesan cheese fries. I still recommend this place for lunch or dinner.
5,"I have been here 3 times, and find it unique to Phoenix with a country French ambience without being ""cute-sy."" The patio is one of the loveliest we have here in Scottsdale. My daughter and I celebrated an early Mothers Day here recently. We were seated in just the right spot on the patio to tuck my grandson and his stroller in a corner next to the table. We splurged on some white sangria for lunch.....so pretty it had its photo posted on Facebook. The Brie and Carmelized apples also came with grapes and strawberries and it was a very large serving of cheese. It could easily be a meal or feed 4 as an appetizer. We actually ran out of bread, because the Brie wheel was a nice large serving. The smoked ham sandwiches on crusty baguette are so good that I am craving them a few days later ....we used the still-warm gooey Brie on them, too. This place is just special! Plan an event, take a guest. It is a spot that will make it memorable. This was my first lunch as a new Grandmother with my daughter. My daughter is from the beach area in SCal, and she was wowd. Thanks for the memories.......beautiful day."
4,"The ""Shoe Dog"" experience was quite fun and entertaining!  It assists in finding the right shoe for your foot...and pretty accurate!

5,"stopped here on our way home on a road trip.  if i had known, i wouldve stopped on the way out, too.  the bear name drew me in (and the assumption that a diner would have chocolate malts).   the food was fantastic.  boyfriend ordered ""bobs big bear burger"" and it was probably the biggest hamburger ive seen in person.  apparently it was delicious (how he ate the whole thing, i will never know).  i ordered some sort of burger basket combo, featuring a much smaller cheeseburger (which was delicious), hearty portion of fries (which were ok), and the chocolate malt was only $2.99 (instead of $4.50-ish)  with the combo.  And it was one of the best chocolate malts Ive ever had.  And the prices were reasonable.  And I actually loved the kitschy bear theme.  Cant wait for another trip that takes me through Phoenix (and I never thought I would say that)."
4,"We went here after the Rainbow Festival and it was such a great place! The food was great, the service was awesome and the patio is a great place to enjoy your meal! Bliss has made it to my list of places to eat downtown!"
5,"After a second visit, the chicken was a little dry and lacked flavor. Quite a contrast to my first visit. Still enjoyed the meal, but wasnt as impressed with the chicken. Ill have to go back to see if it was a fluke."
5,A very professional company that takes the time to deal with you on a personal level.   With great reassurance from Nate and his team they were able to handle the short sale of our home with very little stress and in a timely manner. They really helped when we thought no one could.  From beginning to end we were always kept informed and they got the job done.
2,"If your products werent my number two love I would abandon you!!!  I only say this of this location!  One associate was SO snotty I wanted to punch her, and Im not a violent individual!  Fashion Square receives my loyalty..."
5,"My husband and I have been going to the Touch of Thai for years. We meet up there at least twice a month for a lunch date. On special occasions we take friends and family there for dinner. I love the wait staff - especially Nick! His wonderful sarcasm and jokes always make our day!  For the amount of food you get at lunch at the price they charge - you cant beat it. Everything is homemade and tastes fresh. #3 Yellow Curry is my hubbys favorite. Rich coconut based sauce with yellow curry. The chicken is tender and the potatoes and carrots are cooked perfectly. I venture off and try things from time to time. The food is spicy. I like the incorporation of fresh herbs into the dishes. The soup served with lunch is always yummy and changes from time to time. We always get a side order of spring rolls. You need to try these! I like the Pad Thai as well as the #5 and #7 lunch specials. Meals are served fairly quickly.  Sometimes we have to get up and refill our own water glasses however I find this to be a wee bit charming. Feels like I am home. If you go there on a regular basis the servers remember you, have your order into the kitchen before you even are seated, and always say hello and smile."
4,"Food is great, but they use to let you get the happy hour specials for take out, but not anymore. I love their prime rib burger, if you have a few extra bucks to spend on the best burger in the world than go here."
4,Great flatbreads and atmosphere
4,"Itd be nice to see this chain grow and get a little more traction in the Valley.  The shoestring fries are pretty good, the burgers have a great seasoning.  Maybe the burgers could be a little bigger, I guess, but Im nitpicking. The real star for me is the custard, and my favorite is picking up a good chocolate shake.  The stuff is very rich and a sugar coma waiting to happen.  Shakes arent the cheapest, but theyre pretty unbeatable mood boosters. Ill have to change my review once I try more on the menu, but for now, Im a fan, and I enjoy the place.  Good fast food and doesnt disappoint."
1,Filthy place.  Bad tasteless food.  Rude waitress.  Yuck!!!!
3,As good as it gets for Chinese food in Surprise right now.
4,"We popped in here for a brew while walking around heritage square. The waitstaff is very friendly and attentive. Note: if you just want a brew - you can order it inside! We went with a local Hefe and it was great! The options for noshing look great, but we were headed for dinner so we didnt get a chance to try them out! See you there soon!"
3,"Ive been here a number of times and the food is always good.  They have a fantastic selection of cheese and its a great place to try boutique cheeses.   The current rating is due to the service we received last night.  The hostess was very friendly but our waitress was sorely lacking.  After our food arrived and two in our party still needed silverware, we informed her and she never returned with silverware.  We ended up stealing it from a neighboring table.  She made a bleak attempt at humor telling us that one of the cheeses was a water-based calorie-free cheese when were pretty sure its a triple cream.  If shed had an iota of personality, the joke might have flown.  But, it fell flat and left us confused wondering if wed really just ordered calorie free cheese.   We enjoyed our evening anyway.  The service could just use a little work."
4,"This is my favorite Pho place in Arizona.  The menu is diverse, an the staff is friendly.  They will answer any and all questions.  Ive heard them giving ""lessons"" on how to eat pho several times.  The food is great, and the keep the drinks filled.  Ive never had a complaint, and Ive been there numerous times.  You will not be disappointed."
3,"Alright, so how does it go from being a 1-star (actually, less than that) to being a 3-star review? Simple, they seem better than the last time I was working/shopping here. I went here the other night to help my boyfriend find an interview outfit and noticed that the store had a handful of the same employees as they did back in the Summer, but certain areas of clothing had been moved around. Despite all the moving and switching around they must have done, the store seemed really clean and in order. In fact, I really have no issues with this store except one, teeny tiny, little problem...the check out girl! I remember her from when I worked here and she gave me attitude when I needed to ask her something. Turns out, it wasnt a one time thing.. shes just a rude person. On this particular night, there were only two check out girls and a line of about 15 people. My boyfriend and I were making seperate purchases and knew one of us was going to get her. I happened to get the friendly one, but before we each paid for our items, we were watching as the rude girl didnt crack even ONE half-hearted attempt at a smile. We listened as she rudely explained to some elderly ladies why a certain item was marked on sale but the same item was normal priced. They wanted to make sure they werent paying too much/too little and her explanation?: ""That ones been the store longer."" It didnt make sense to them, or to those of us in line watching, but she kept getting huffy about it until they dropped the issue. She shoved peoples items in bags and practically threw them at them and said, again without trying to fake some kind of customer service, ""Have a good night. Bye. NEXT!"" Yuck. My cashier was slightly more frienldy, but still not awesome. It was obvious she was having a long night (afterall, she was stuck at the register with the Ice Queen), so it was understandable. Also, I didnt catch her name, but the girl working in the dressing rooms was really sweet and kept greeting everyone that came by.  I had to call this location to get the name of the manager for something I was filling out on a form and I was told theyve got a new manager. Thus, I know why this jumped up two stars. It could have been four, but certain things they havent fixed (rude cashier girl) have kept this review at a solid three."
4,"Okay, it almost seems a shame to burst the bubble of the positive reviews of this place, but I just have to.  Im not an Indian food expert, but I am a serious enthusiast and Ive eaten at dozens of Indian places on three continents, not to mention my family being from the vicinity of that area of the world and therefore having grown up on curry and rice and all things spice. We went here for lunch yesterday (Sunday), thanks to a Yelp/Aloqa recommendation after wed had a romp at Estrella Mountain Park and were starving. The place was almost deserted at 1pm, with only one other table occupied - fair enough. We went for the buffet. And I have to say, it was simply ""okay"". The buffet didnt have a particularly wide variety of stuff - several items were cheap regulars such as the saag and the dhal - spinach and lentils for the uninitiated. They did have aloo zucchini, never seen that before - tasted okay, about as good as Id have been able to make it (and thats actually not a compliment). No lamb dishes - disappointing, but unfortunately this is also rare. Flavorwise, I found it boring and unspectacular. Saag is saag, tandoori chicken is tandoori chicken, except their chicken was very light on the tandoori smoke flavour. None of the food left the slight zing on my tongue that it should have. Rice was okay, but then you typically cant go wrong with cooking basmati (although another reviewers mileage apparently differed on this count). We had our almost-3-year-old along and he did have a little rice, chicken and beef - it was his first real curry and thus a pretty substantial milestone for us. Then the wife went to get a little kheer and a gulab jamun ball. The kheer was watery but tasted okay - compared unfavourably to the sabudaana kheer at India Palace. The jamun ball was almost completely solid - you had to press real hard with a fork to cut it, normally theyre nice and soft and soaked. However, another one I got was normal - so it was just the luck of the draw there. Beef curry was nice, although the first piece I ate was mainly fat - whatever, you get that and I dont mind it. The fried pakoras can normally be cut through with a fork. These you had to saw through with a knife - not great, chewy to the point of almost being crunchy. No samosas in the buffet. The naan was unusual. Ive had a LOT of naan before and this stuff was the uncommon kind, not thick and pita-ey but instead a little more like a roti. It tasted very fresh - we had plain and also garlic - and the wife really liked it. Kid did too. I personally prefer the other sort of naan - softer and a little more substance to it, but this one had merit regardless. However, it took at least fifteen minutes after our food was served before the naan arrived. All up, middle of the road as far as Im concerned, although the wife quite liked it. Note that this is for the buffet only - we did not have a-la-carte and perhaps the to-order cooked food may have tasted better. Ive had better buffets - the best one in Phoenix west of the 17 IMO is India Palace - a wider variety, a lot busier (as a result, Im sure) and more flavourful food. Admittedly, I havent tried any other Indian places south of Bell but west of the 17 except for Sutra. Bell appears to have most of them? I would normally have given this place a flat three stars, but Im going to give it an extra half and round up for a few reasons. Firstly, the waiter was real nice and very attentive - up to the standard of a typical US chain place, rather than the silent wanderers with the Easter Island statue facial expressions at other buffets who do no more than refill your water and clear your dirty dishes every fifteen minutes or so. He was asking us how we were doing, offered refills of my wifes iced tea at appropriate times etc. Spot on. Next, theres a buffet discount where all kids under 10 are $5 - however, we noticed that they appropriately knocked the price down to $3.50 for us, unbidden and I guess for the simple reason that he was set up in a high chair and obviously only ate 1/4 of a breakfast bowl worth of food in total. Third, the place had nice decor (although I was a bit concerned there were no tablecloths, with my kid banging his plastic sippy cup and spilling sh1t all over the tabletop) and thankfully they didnt have sh1tapple wudda-wudda-waa-waa pretentious bhangra muzak playing in a cheap attempt at making you feel like youre actually in India. Id eat here again, but only if Im in the area and DYING for Indian food. It simply didnt measure up, either buffet-wise or flavour-wise. For first-timers, I can see how they would have enjoyed the experience - clean seating area, Americanized flavours and a good waiter. My experience, however, has been burned in over almost four decades and Ive kicked the tyres of more cuisines from this area of the world than I can recount, especially Indian. Three and a half, rounded up to four, Seacrest out."
5,"From the moment we walked in the door we were treated like celebrities. I wish I was one after leaving here! The food was some of the best Thai weve ever had, and I live in Chicago and have tasted dishes more than a dozen different authentic Thai restaurants.  We never were without a glass of water or a full glass of wine. I wish I lived here so I could make this a regular stop during my weekly Thai and Sushi cravings.  The Tilapia was out of this world - topped off with a delicious medley of mint, onions and lemon leaves. I highly recommend the Spring Rolls - very fresh and tasty! Give this place a try - you wont be disappointed."
4,Fantastic atmosphere. Very Very friendly staff. Food presentation was spot on. We had drinks and a Brick Oven Flatbread (cheese) and it was delicious. I cant wait to go back and try a full entree. They had a Salmon dish on the menu I am going to try when I return. I was staring at other dishes and they looked mouth watering.
1,"I ate here for the first time a few weeks ago on a Friday night/Saturday morning after seeing a show at the Tempe Improv. I came in around midnight and the place was not that busy. The waitress was pretty nice (did everything expected for a waitress) and the guy who I thought was the manager was easy to talk to. However, those are the only two good things I can say about the restaurant. I ordered the BBQ wings and they were TERRIBLE. The flavor was very bland and half cold. The blue cheese I ordered was quite watery as well. I also sat by the kitchen and noticed that a guy in the back was washing a stool in a sink near where the food was made. Needless to say, I wont be eating at Hooters anytime soon."
2,"They get 2 stars, for the pickles.  So Im from Jersey and was very happy to see all the NYC/Jersey stuff in this place.  The walls were covered in things from my state so I figured they know a thing or two about real NYC pastrami.  I was very wrong! This had to be the worst pastrami I have ever had! Whats with the places in this area advertising themselves as either being a NY style deli or NY style pizza? I mean, I know were the most awesome people in the country and our food is the best, but dont say youre like us unless you really are! Maybe if youve never had the real thing, you think this is quality? This sucks giant donkey balls and Im sorry I ever tried it! Really, instead of spending all that time trying to make your place look like Jersey and NYC, spend that time practicing making good food.  That, not decor, gets you good reviews!  If youre from the East coast and looking for authentic NYC food, avoid this place. They also claim their bagels are just like NY...yea, I wont be trying those!"
4,"I love the kitsch of this place! Bears bears everywhere! Black Bear Diners are usually found in small to medium sized towns, but for some reason this one is smack in the middle of urban sprawl. So not complaining though, because it means I dont have to drive to the middle of nowhere to enjoy their old-timey newspaper-menu and awesome pot roast!  Their fare is strictly comfort food and always well-prepared. The full portions will fill an average 200lb guy, so its nice that smaller folk like myself have the option of getting the small (or ""senior) portion!  Save room for their personal-sized pies...you wont regret it!"
5,"Hands down the best breakfast Ive ever had, anywhere. It definitely feels like home cooked breakfast. Ive never been to this place on the weekend when it isnt packed out the door. Im not the only person that loves this place!"
4,"Ive been going here off an on since 2004, and have had pleasant experiences. It seems like the same guys since the first time I went, which to me tells me they have experience and a loyalty to their company and customers. They are always nice to me, and try to explain whats going on with my car as well as present me with options for repair. They are also great about trying to save me money by doing things like contacting manufacturers about warranties, offering me packaged deals that cover what i wanted anyways, and providing discounts.  One time I went for a package deal that was actually cheaper than the individual things i needed done for my 60,000 mile checkup. Part of the package included new filters, but since I had just switched them out myself and they were still in practically new condition. They went ahead and gave me the new filters, saying that I didnt need new ones, but i paid for them. I really appreciated this even if they only cost a few bucks each.  Another time, it was slightly unfortunate in that it took a very long for them to get to my car and complete all the repairs/order parts etc. I waited patiently and didnt complain and they were very grateful. They kept thanking me for my patience and apologizing for the wait. When the bill came they had given me every special and discount available including an overall discount on the bottom line for the wait. Its not often that companies will give you anything without you having to bitch. While the wait was unfortunate, they did what they could to make it an overall good customer service experience.  Overall good customer service, and a place that I trust.  **as an added bonus, the mesa library is within walking distance."
3,"Its a hotel bar, so expect typical hotel pricing on drinks.  They have some good tapas to choose from, ask for the calamari, but a grilled version (off the menu)... its REALLY good.  Ive had a few of their drinks there, but I stick to the mojitos, but had plenty of others that were just as good."
5,"As far as indie record stores, this is truly as good as it gets in the valley. It is a breath of fresh air because it is a REAL record store, and you can sample CDs along the wall to get your music fix. I love how they have a list of recommended new releases. I definitely refer to them if my music is getting stale. Recently, my husband and I have bought albums from Beirut, Andrew Bird and Iron & Wine. They have everything your heart desires- so go and get you some! OH- and I just found out you can buy concert tickets there, and they usually give out a free ""Magnet"" magazine with each purchase. Woohoo!"
3,"I was up for a cold sugary drink before getting onto my flight so I walked over to the Wendys next to this place. The guy at this place looked bored so I walked over to his counter to buy the drink. He was quite friendly and very prompt to charge me for the drink, which was quite a bit cheaper than the same drink at Wendys. He also said I could either use the Coke machine or the iced tea dispensers. He had two kinds of iced tea, regular and a green blackberry. I took a little bit of the green blackberry which was very refreshing and tasted pretty good. I then went over to the Coke machine to get that. The sign on the Coke machine basically said once you buy a cup, you can refill it again and again the same day of purchase. Ill remember this if I ever have a layover in Phoenix. The prices at the Starbucks in this airport would drain my wallet fast if I had to be in the airport for any amount of time."
5,"I cant believe I havent wrote a review for Teds yet! By far, one of my favorite places to go. You can get full off of some tasty food for a great price. I normally get a hot dog with mayo, onion, hot sauce and a pickle. I also like the corn dog and onion rings. I can always get a satisfying and fulfilling meal for $5-7. Love it! Can get a little crowded on the weekends, but generally all the people are pretty fast and nice."
3,This Pei Wei is consistant with its orders being correct & clean. My one wish is that the parking lot it shares with Starbucks & Sidebar were about 15 cars larger. I dont see that happening but a girl can wish cant she?
4,"I will begin by saying that Ive been wanting to try this place for months now, simply because they have a salad that bears my name. Which reminds me of my high school days, when the internet was new and I spent an afternoon with a friend visiting websites that also had our name. Most ended up being adult sites, but tonia.com* was an Asian company that had my name written in a fantastic logo. I wonder what it means.  Anywho, not only does the salad live up to its given name, but Moto is now on my backup sushi rotation. Reasonably priced and of good quality, I was extremely full by the time I ate only half of my dinner. The Tonia salad I actually had for lunch a day later, and was very filling and delicious. I can only imagine what it wouldve been like eating it the same night. Had it not been as great, I wouldve never came back and written to the owners, demanding the salad change to a lesser awesome name, maybe one more common or boring. My to go order was ready exactly when they said it would and I was in and out the door in minutes. Ill be back. *I have no idea if this is still the same site anymore. I am not responsible for where the link leads.. now.. or in the future"
3,"Great location, super cool conversion of an old gas station. My only gripe would be that barista didnt rinse portafilter before pulling my espresso shots , thus my cappuccino tasted burnt. This is however a common problem at most indy coffee places."
4,"The biggest tip for Last Chance is to go in with an open mind about what to buy.  Inevitably, if youre looking for rainboots and remember seeing a ton the last time you were there, there wont be a single pair to be found when you return.  This happened to me recently -- but, instead of the boots, I found an unopened package of Spanx (marked down from $36 to $7.97), olive-colored DKNY tights for $.97, and a pair of Hunter knee-high boot socks for $4.97 (for when I eventually do find the rain boots).  I wasnt really looking for any of these finds, but couldnt resist.  You just never know what will be there -- I saw one woman toting around three life-sized cardboard stand-ups of Twilight characters.  Go with the flow, and dont get too focused on one particular brand or item."
4,"Fresh and simple!  Tastes great!  Worth the drive!  The burgers are like the ones you make at home!  I had the sweet potato fries, highly recommended."
4,"The wifey and I went here last night and it was pretty good. I had some pork dish that was amazing and she had filet mignon tacos that were delicious as well. I really should have taken better note of the exact dish name I had but alas... I did not.  Anyways, great atmosphere, friendly staff and really good food. The only reason Im not giving them a 5 is because they charge for chips and salsa and their salsa was pretty weak. By weak I mean not spicy. Come on, put some peppers in there!"
5,North Glendales cool new  hangout.  Formerly Cactus Willys.  Completely remodelled!  Follow us on facebook at Justin Willys!
4,"Ok...this place is *REALLY* outdated...HOWEVER, the food was great.  The Veggie plate was gone fast (barely got to taste any of it ... wife loved it) and my Gryo plate was very good as well.  This is the ONLY other place that Ive been to where the Felafel was great!  Ive been to only one other place..."
1,"Pros:  -No breed restrictions on dogs -Washer and dryer in unit Cons:  -Awful and idiotic leasing staff. Forms will be missing or prepared incorrectly. -Rude and inadequate maintenance (be prepared to supply your own tools half of the time) -Trash divers daily that no one does anything about -No on-site security (you can call after 9 pm for a ""courtesy patrol"" but it takes them hours to arrive) and the front gate is NEVER closed -Vandalized cars  -A MURDER (this was the location of the man who set his pregnant girl friend on fire) -The main pool is beautifully maintained and clean. The 3 other pools are small, dirty, and frequently closed.  -Bug infestations in most apartments -Dogs kept on patios 24/7 (a clear violation of the lease) so their barking can be heard by all -The basketball court and tennis courts are never available, as they are constantly used by kids to bike ride on with the encouragement of the apartment staff -Tons of potholes! Driving through the parking lot requires excellent shocks and there is minimal guest parking -The apartments have less insulation than a cardboard box. Freezing in the winter, sweltering in the summer. Nothing is fitted correctly to its frame, either.  If you can afford a better place, I highly reccommend it."
3,"DVAP.... You have to go at least once in your life. It really is a neat place with alot of history.  The service is great, it appears to be family run.  The food is good. Better then Dennys but not as good as Mimis.  I had the all u can eat of beef ribs, lasagna, meat loaf, cat fish, chicken, mashed and diced potatoes, stuffing, rice, homemade apple pie, etc and salad bar. I know I am missing a bunch of stuff they had but you get the drift.  They run specials on Prime rib and stuff so you might want to call to see what they are serving the night you go."
3,"We have been using Delias Cleaners now for nearly three years and for the most part found the experience to be very good.   Yes, like most cleaners they goof from time to time (like sometimes killing the button-downs on my dress shirts).  But, heres the difference -- theyll fix them for no charge.  Yep.  Just ask, the staff is very helpful!"
4,"Okay, since my latest review, I was contacted by the manager who expressed concern on my bad experience. Fran wanted to make sure they had the opportunity to make it right. I was impressed! I do want to say that even if the food sometimes needs a little sumptin sumptin, the customer service is Great and always has been! I give them superb credit for that & the ambiance is nice too. We went back for another try & we were satisfied. I definitely think you should stick with the thin or traditional crust, it was better. Also a note to update a previous review - they no longer have the Portobello Steak Sticks, not sure why, maybe a cost thing, but they were delicious and I will miss them! Another cool note that should be said because it cant be said about most places with an outdoor patio - they do not allow smoking in the patio dining area, which is such a refreshing change. Its nice to be able to enjoy the great Arizona weather this time of year. Thanks for that! Final words... BoomBozz is on the top of our list again"
2,"Im torn with Cream. Ive been to the usual clubs and lounges in Scottsdale enough to be sick of them, and Cream was something new. I like that Cream is emulating Vegas-style nightclubs, but its obviously trying too hard. The decor: First of all, this place is PAINFULLY tiny. Ive only been here once, and while it was half full, so it wasnt completely unbearable. But I cant imagine what it must be like when they have guest DJs and other performers in. A tiny place thats packed isnt popular. Its just... small. The walls are covered in white (leather?), the tiles are white, everything is white - I get it, white like Cream? I appreciate the commitment to the color but the theme is waaay off. The hard surfaces make the place look cold and very hospital like - I would have liked to see more smooth lines and softness in the design, more flowy like cream. The atmosphere: The dig the loud music and the techno. I get so sick of hearing the same stupid songs on the radio. I love the change in scene. Phoenix/Scottsdale is so stale in terms of music. This is a nice change. But its too loud when you cant even put an order in for your drink. I literally had to pull myself onto the bar (Im tiny, 53"") so I could give my order directly into the bartenders ear. They also had a really cool entertainment act - a girl hung from a hoop suspended from the ceiling wearing a white bikini. She was clearly talented in her hoop manipulating and was mesmerizing to watch, but like I said, this place is TINY, and there were several instances in which she was inches away from kicking people in the face. And THAT would have been worth the ridiculous cover I didnt pay (I try to find any way not to.) The drinks:  Overpriced and terrible. Maybe the bartender THOUGHT she heard me say I wanted a glass of vodka piss, because thats what it tasted like. I doubt there will be any improvements made that will make me like Cream better, but heres hoping."
4,"Beep Beep!  Whos got the keys to my jeep?  Vroooom! (Missy ""Misdemeanor "" Elliott) Food Truck Friday happens, well, every Friday in downtown Phoenix.  Located off Pierce and Central the the food truck phenomenum has arrived in Phoenix.  Thank you Great Food Truck Race on Food Network!  Actually Food Truck Friday was started by the Phoenix Street Food Coalition.  If you didnt know, Phoenix lags behind in the food truck scene like Los Angeles, New York, Portland, etc.  Who knew huh?  Yeah, like you didnt know! The area where this event happens is not very big.  Seating is a B-I-T-C (shut your mouth!) Im not even going to bring up the Shaft!  However, come early enough and maybe youll get lucky.  Some people to do the ""Im saving these seats for a friend"", thing, which really really is annoying!   Needless to say the scene is awesome!  Hot dogs, burgers, pizza, rice bowls, and cajun burritos!  I guarantee youll come back for more and to explore the different flavors!  You definitely wont have all Friday to do so, but check out their daily weekly schedule - http://www.downtownphoenix.com/blog/tag/food-truck-fridays/ - Enjoy!"
5,"Ok, Ill say this up front, I dont like chains.  There are just far too many awesome restaurants in Phoenix/Scottsdale to go to a chain. That being said, this place is amazing and the quality and consistency here is unreal.  Yes, it ""seems"" expensive but once youve eaten here youll realize that you are absolutely getting your moneys worth. So much awesome unlimited red meat. Dont let them trick you with the salad bar!  Its killer but dont fill up!  And dont be ashamed to leave your flipper thing on GREEN, the sign of meat greed. hahahahaha. Lastly, try the Tres Leches and the Key Lime Pie, out of this world."
4,"I have friends that I meet there once a month for a delicious greasy spoon breakfast and these guys never disappoint.  I am a breakfast maven so love their hash browns most of all.  If Im feeling a little decadent, I order a side of gravy with them.  Its really nice to sit outside during the cooler months and have some fries and a shake too!"
4,"My husband and I went there for lunch today and because of vegegirly C.s review about the deep fried pickles guess what we ordered??? OMG they were amazing! We ordered the cajun style and man oh man were they goooooood! We have never even heard of them but I am so glad we got them. So crispy and so hot! Mmmmm (and 1/2 priced)!!! We got greeted and seated quickly. I ordered the chicken brie sandwhich and my husband had the meatloaf sandwhich. I am not sure where the comment about small portions came from because they were good sized and we were both stuffed! The only change to the chicken brie would be to have the pears sliced thinner rather than having thick pears to bite through. Otherwise it was yummy. I also ordered the ""Arizona Iced Tea"" for the first time since they didnt have fresh mint to make my mojito. I was pleasantly surprised at how light and refreshing it was. We had the entertainment card which they didnt punch so we can use it again, and we will :)"
5,"Great service! Great Value! Best in the valley hands down!!!!  I am a second generation customer and as far as i can remember my mom has always took my clothes here, from my 8th grade promotion dress, my HS prom dress, my college graduation dress and now i take my husbands suits here!  Park Avenue has been there for all of my wonderful growing years and hopefully will be here for my future children as well!!"
5,"Beautiful little gem of a restaurant.  Great outdoor seating, amazing-truly amazing mussels.  Wholeheartedly recommend, perfect ""date night"" too."
5,Wonderful place to hangout with friends ...small and cozy. Hoegaarden white ale with chicken tikka masala pasty is my usual.
4,"Sakana is one of the few sushi places that I return to. There is usually always a wait (no reservations, which is a PITA), but the sushi is fresh, service is quick (so its not always super friendly), and the calamari salad is SO effin good. Their lunch specials remind me of something Id find in So. CA-- tasty, filling and reasonably priced. Its lively on the weekends with several tables doing sake bombs so its a fun place to celebrate birthdays."
2,"Things that might happen at Bikini Lounge: You might watch your friends dance with a bum in front of the juke box. You might drink far too many pitchers of PBR. You might throw a fit when you realize it is cash only. The Bikini Lounge is quite possibly the crappiest place known to man. I mean its in a shitty neighborhood where you might die, doesnt take credit cards, and has only bags of chips for food. So why do I keep going back? because eventful things happen here. Dont go if you want to have a quiet night with a couple of friends and go home and go to bed. Go here if you want to show up to a bar full of low lifes, order pitchers of PBR until you and your friends are all sick, then go outside and forget where you are and turn left down Grand Avenue only to find out you are nowhere near home when you get to the burned down church on 5th ave and monroe and a bum asks you for money. After that, youll get in a bike taxi/rikshaw and tell the guy you can only pay him in cigarettes and then when he agrees, have him take you to another bar, instead of home, and then you will be further than you were to begin with. When you finally do get home thanks to a caring homeless guy that actually does have money (you find this out because he has a car) and gives you a ride home. You wake up the next morning wondering why all of your cash is gone, how much you drank, and where your friends are. If THAT is the kind of night you are looking for, Bikini Lounge is IT!"
5,"Im a pho snob, my hitlist is impressive. In Olympia, I ate pho literally every single day. Test me, wannabe purists... Nam Sao is the best. The guy always working and seeming to make the food is so quick and super sweet. Great service, my drink never goes empty, and the table is set in traditional pho-joint style: a metal caddy with spoons, forks [...], chopsticks, napkins, and all the delicious condiments. The menu is enormous, so if you happen to be in the mood for something other than their glorious, never-watered-down noodle soup, you can try something else. The spring rolls, I love them. The boba tea is great too, Ive had it thicker and more rich at Pho Hoa in Oly but I like the less creamy variety served at Nam Sao.  Fast service, cheap filling meal, wonderful server.. I literally cannot think of anything bad to say about Nam Sao, except its so small its kind of hard to find if youre new to the spot. Just go to the right of Frys and youll see this little piece of heaven with its lights on, welcoming you in."
1,"Totally dissapointed.  I had purchased a coupon from TravelZoo, to try out this restaurant, which given its location I would have thought it was going to be very upscale and we were expecting a WHOLE LOT MORE.   The Service was great, but the food, not worth it.  The restaurant itself is very outdated, very 80s.   My husband and I had the crab cakes for appertizer.  They were cold when they were served.  We told our waiter, who in turn told the chef, and the message was passed back to us, that she appologized.    My Husband ordred a 12oz New York Strip ala carte for $29.95, 6 oz of that was pure fat!  and for the price you would expect to get more meat than fat!  I ordered a wild mushroom pizza, which was OK.   This place needs an over haul in a major way, if they want to make any money at the restaurant, which for a Saturday night at 7pm when we went, was empty.  I think the highlight of the meal was the bottle of cabinet!"
3,"A hand-job with gardening gloves..... I went looking for Scottsdale Auto Salon to get a hand wash tint quote on my new Mini today. Finding it out of business, I whipped out my handy-dandy Yelp iPhone app looking for a nearby alternate to at least get the wash done and found Classic Car Spa.  Expecting to pay a bit more for a traditional hand wash I was surprised to find a machine assisted process. Id spent way to long trying to locate the place (thank you Google maps) so I just opted for their supreme wash, which includes both interior and exterior detail. My son and I watched the car move through the process and saw that at least the wash part was done by hand, but they used the same mitts from the filthy truck that had gone through previously. -1 star After seeing this, I should have watched their interior detail more closely. When I got the car back there were lines of dirt in my white roof, and water spots on the accent chrome. When we got in the car there still bits of chip on the seat and floor mat from my sons spill the day, and it was obvious that the dash and interior hadnt been detailed. (Unless they refrain from using any product what so ever on the interior of the car. The dash and steering wheel were bone dry and dusty.)  - 1 star I should have brought it up to someone, but my husbands and sons hunger won over and we just left. Thankfully all of their other locations are to far out of the way to bother detouring to again. The staff was friendly, and their waiting area was pleasant with lots of drink choices, although Im not sure their waiting area was comfy enough for anything longer than a wash."
5,"Bacado. Yes, you read that correctly.... The ""Bacado"". It is a glorious concoction consisting of an avocado and bacon omelette with cheese on top and served with an English muffin and country fried potatoes. Decent black coffee and good service. Delicious."
1,"I was so looking forward to breakfast here. What a disappointment. The food is the only thing that rates any stars at all. Good ingredients cannot be completely ruined by incompetent service. The space is nice, but crowded and loud. The counter staff were indifferent. After being waved over to an open register, the fellow behind the counter took one order, then wandered off, leaving the rest of us to get back in line at the other register to order. You are given a number (or not) and left to find your own table, scrounge up your own silverware, and wait for your food to be delivered. Except that the napkins are at a completely different station than the silver, they were out of forks, and most of the tables were completely filthy. I watched a busboy randomly swipe the top of a table, sweeping crumbs onto the benches and chairs, then leave an empty drink bottle on the table before wandering listlessly off. Beverages are (apparently) serve yourself, although they didnt bother to say that when I ordered. I stood at the counter, waiting for iced tea, only to turn around and see that I was expected to get it myself. If they happen to ""run out of numbers"", then they input your name with your order. Nothing irritates me more than to have my name shouted across a restaurant. Better yet, the waiters wander from table to table looking for their customers.... ""Lisa? Is there a Lisa here?"" while your food cools. Inexcusable. The only bright point: the croque madame was tasty. Delicious bread, ham, and a perfectly fried egg. But the meager smear of bechamel and a thin slice of cheese were underwhelming. However, the ""side of fruit"" made me angry: a tiny metal creamer with 1 blackberry, a few slices of strawberry, and 2 chunks of  green apple. Insulting. Fast casual, order at the counter works well when tables are clean and set, and the food delivery is speedy and efficient. Unfortunately this place needs some work in order to make it worth your time."
2,This place made me remember why I dont live in Scottsdale anymore.
5,Primp and Blow at the Waterfront is divine! I walked out feeling like a  Super Model without spending a fortune! Great Stylists. Upbeat Friendly  atmosphere. Great Tunes and an overall GREAT VIBE!  Convenient Parking  and centrally located right near Fashion Square and Olive and Ivy. LOVE it!
4,"Ok, Ok, I know I said I would never bring my clothes here, ever again. I was having a rather busy week, so I told my Dad to drop my clothes off to the cleaners. I thought he was going to take my stuff over to Continental where I usually go, but he brought everything to Seville.  I was a little upset, but being the angel of a son that I am, I bit the bullet and smiled. I thanked him for helping me out.  When it came time to pick up my clothes, I carefully walked in (knowing I slammed them in my past review) and quietly picked up my clothes. I got home, and noticed that one of my shirts had not been cleaned properly. There was a stain on it from what I think was cola. Later that day, I drove back to Seville, and they offered to clean it once more. Flash forward to the next pickup day, the stain was still there. I asked for a manager, and it happened to be someone that seemed to be the owner. He asked how much I paid for the shirt.  They gave me a check for the FULL amount.  Its very rare that I write a review update that spans a few stars (only DeFalcos comes to mind), but Seville took my crappy situation, and made it right.  I was VERY hesitant in coming back the first time around, and it was only because I was forced to. Im glad everything worked out the way it did. Not because I got a new shirt out of it, but because I got a better experience. Way to step up your game Seville. Ill be back if Im in the area!"
4,"I really like this place. However it does suck time like no other place. Somehow evertime you are there for over 2 hrs? I usually try on 60 items to get 1 that fits well, and cry a half dozen times about being fat :( Then I cruise the little kids clothes because the mens clothes are to large for me and the womens are cut weird. One of my boobs is like a 3rd the size of the other so its soo hard to find clothes that dont make me look like a cancer survivor. Anyway, good finds here. Try the clothes on even if it says the size is smaller than you wear. A lot of times it says one size but is really another. My girlfriend bought 200.00 jeans for 20.00 a piece because it said they were a 24 when they were really a 27. P.S. anyone know where to find some dress vests? The womens ones are too short and make me look like I have flowing love handles and the mens vests are to big in the shoulders and ribs. I think I should try maybe a kids vest? thoughts?"
4,This would be a  great place to live at
3,A good place for bugers and fries.
1,"Went last week, and ordered a dozen variety. I didnt care for any of them, very dry, the frosting wasnt very good,even my 9 yr old daughter spit her cupcake out!"
1,"I had received an email from a student retention telling me that I still owe money for the time that I had taken classes (two weeks) although these fools canceled my financial aid. I will sue this school if they even attempt to collect money from me and I have withdrawn from the classes on the right time, but this rep. told me that the withdrawal period was Jan. 11."
5,Have you ever tried the chicken rotisserie here? They go fast so you have to be lucky to get one unless you call ahead. Its not so much about the rotisserie chicken as it is about the amazing and creamy and smooth and exceptionally well balanced Garlic Sauce/spread they give you that goes along with the chicken.  Have I told you how amazing this spread is. If only I knew the recipe...I would eat it by the tub...okay maybe by the spoonfuls. Anyway...try the chicken rotisserie or the chicken taook. Heck if you dont want to eat either of those things...just ask for some garlic sauce on the side with whatever you are eating. You will not be disappointed.
4,"This place is a gem. Its a bit tucked away. It kinda felt like I was going on a bit of adventure. The restaurant was very small and oh so cozy. Just they way I likem. We had the Rock Shrimp breaded in coconut accompanied by a Thai Chili Dipping Sauce it was delicious. My main course was the Chicken breast stuffed with goat cheese, apricot, basil, spinach, shrimp and crimini mushrooms finished in a balsamic reduction glaze it was yummy. Service was on Point. I would so go again."
2,"Honestly, not that exciting. I heard a lot of hype about it from ASU friends of mine but I wasnt impressed. It was just your run of the mill Mexican food. And I didnt like that you ordered at the counter and got your chips in a paper gravy boat. The whole concept of the resturant would flow so much easier if it was set up like a regular sit down Mexican resturant. But appreantly it makes wonderful hangover food. I dunno."
4,"When Sen. Ken Cheuvront opened this restaurant, I was living in Midtown phoenix and it was at a time when a lot of restaurants in the area didnt exist. I was beyond excited of its creation.  Its a very trendy urban feel, with a nice patio on Central Avenue. Located at the bottom of Artisan condos, its not a terribly easy place to see if youre driving by. They feature an incredible selection of wines and cheeses, of which you can purchase and take home as well as nosh in the restaurant. They also feature smaller sized entrees for those who are not looking to get stuffed on greasy messes and feel sick all night. A particular favorite of mine are the ancho pork empanadas which are fluffy and crispy with a little orange in the pork. They are definitely delicious. Also great is their white pizza featuring sea scallops.  There is nothing here that is oddly unique, but everything is interesting, and it is a nice spot to hang out with friends and have a nice night out. Especially during a first friday."
4,"I think Im in love. If I only lived closer to Downtown Phoenix, Id leave my mark on the Lost Leaf in the form of a permanent intaglio of my ass cheeks on a bar stool.  Its tucked away on a side street in a humble looking home cum art gallery cum bar. It can be a little tricky to find since no sign exists, so keep an eye out for the neon lit open sign. You definitely dont want to miss out on this place by becoming frustrated after fruitlessly ducking down side streets, saying fuck it and going to The Roosevelt. While it wouldnt be a total bust, youd be missing out on the warm and inviting ambiance of the Lost Leaf. Thats really what won me over about this bar. It made me feel downright cozy, with exposed brick and wood, local artists artwork decorating the walls, and the actual kitchen serving as the bar. The main room is large enough to host a large group, but small enough to be homey. The acoustics are very good (soft talkers rejoice!) and the music playing was loud enough to add to the mood, but nowhere near the point of drowning out conversation. There are a couple rooms in addition to the main bar area that you can duck off into for more intimate conversation, as well as an outdoor patio thats a little on the small side but, super score--theres ceiling fans! I found the prices to be very reasonable and the service to be unpretentious and helpful. There are no beers on tap here, but the selection of bottles is mind bogglingly extensive. I had to ask the bartender to get me his favorite pale beer and I ended up finding out that I am also in love with a brew called 1664. Looks like a wine cooler, but manages to be respectable instead of laughable. So bring a couple friends with you and indulge one night, and then another, and another. Youll be love struck too."
5,Enjoyed the egg rolls.  So glad that they were made out of fried rice paper because I have food allergies.  The entree of BBQ beef with rice noodles was also very good.  I will be going back this weekend with the hubby for sure.  Very clean and nicely decorated restaurant.  Very nice waitress. The restaurant smelled really good too: spices maybe?  A bit warmer than I would like inside.  Maybe they need to turn up the A/C.
4,"Sure the food is good, but out of my last 20 take out orders they got it right maybe once.  The people making the food look so high you would think you were at Cheba Hut, but I just love that damn Broccoli and Wisconsin Cheese soup!  Their fresh dark rye bread is always great. I enjoy the Italian quite a bit and the wife LOVES their tuna salad.  Great healthy place for food if they arent too high to get your order right."
4,"My daughter and I had a couple of the beef and lamb gyros.  They were wonderful.  The meat was tender and juicy,  the bread was soft and pliable.  The only thing that I could find wrong was the tazeki sauce could have used some more spices, it was kind of blah.  We would go back.  Service was great too."
5,"Please give this place a try when youre making your next stop at Pita Jungle. This restaurant seems to be very underrated and overlooked. We went on a Wednesday night around 7:30pm and it was empty while Pita Jungle was packed. Just the two of us on the patio, which was very nice. The interior and atmosphere are great. Nice tables & chairs, candles, shelves with wine bottles and art, and a very nice bar. An Iranian family owns the restaurant and cooks everything themselves. Thats the first sign of a high-quality establishment. They were incredibly nice to us and brought us whatever we needed. They gave us some good suggestions, like their Iced Black Tea, which is fantastic. It has a few other elements to it including Lavender. They brought us extra pita when we ordered some appetizers as well without us even asking. For our appetizers, we tried the hummus and the tabooli. The hummus was very creamy but a little plain. We wished there was more flavor or spice to it. Not a big deal. That was the only part of our meal that was not 5 stars, but 4 stars. The tabooli....ridiculous. Ive never been a fan of tabooli. It usually has too much parsley. But their version was balanced perfectly. For an entree, I tried the Chicken Shawarma and we split a side of Basmati rice with saffron. A huge plate of rice with great seasoning. The saffron and olive oil gave the fluffy rice great texture. The Shawarma was fresh and delicious. The chicken was cooked and seasoned nicely. For dessert, we tried the Persian vanilla ice cream with rose water and saffron as well as the Baghlava. The ice cream was some of the best weve had. Great flavor. The Baghlava was a great complement to the ice cream. A nice sweetness from the honey and the flaky dough was great. So in summary, great atmosphere, great owners, out-of-this-world food, and very affordable. Everything we had came to about $32. We will return many times in the future because their menu is very promising. Just wish their name fit the type of place that it is. The current name makes it sound like just another Middle Eastern restaurant, which it definitely is not."
5,"This isnt your typical Mexican restaurant that puts cheese and sour cream on everything. The food here is light, simple, and fresh. We started out with the guacamole which was amazing. My sister doesnt even like mandarin oranges but it tasted so good in the guacamole she was eating it like it was going out of style. The salsa that came with it was the bomb. One was a spicy red salsa and the other one was a tomatillo salsa. The green one was so good I wanted to drink it. I ordered the chorizo and eggs and my sister ordered a couple of tacos with rice and beans. Everything tasted great and I even had room for dessert after my meal. We had some kind of carmel, banana, crepe thing. It doesnt look like much but it was one of the best desserts Ive ever had. Gallo Blanco is my new obsession."
5,"Chicken wings and cheeseburger meal... Yummmayyyy ever since ive moved away from arizona, i can honestly say that china grill is what i miss most.. their chicken fried rice is really good and so is their cheeseburger.. their general tsos chicken extra spicy is my bfs favorite.. almost everything is good here!!"
5,"WOW this place is good!  SO good!  And not just yummy good, but intrinsically good.  Check out their amazing list of environmentally responsible business practices - http://essencebakery.com/essence_bakery_environmentally_friendly.shtml !   That, and its cute.  And it tastes Yummy!  And they are SO nice!  SOOO nice!  And their deserts are just disgustingly cute and beautiful and freaking good.  I almost bought the mini box of 4 cupcakes for just $3.50.  Bite sized so not too bad, but if I bought them today theyd be gone before I got home.  I got their grilled cheese w/ mozzarella, basil and tomato on grilled buttery brioche bread with a light and tasty green salad on the side.  It will be hard to not come here every week.  I love that all the drinks are refillable - and its up to you to refill them.  Coffee, tea or soda, just walk on up and fill your glass.  And I love that its all so fresh and local!   Important note - You order at the counter, they give you a number and bring out your food.  If youre paying w/ debit card, they will ask you if you want to include a tip.  That threw me.  Id been in the place less than 2 minutes - how do I know if its worth the tip - or how much of a tip its worth??  Bring some cash or plan to deal w/ that question accordingly."
5,"After 6 years of searching I have finally found Laura!  My brows have never really been ""bad"" per se, but not great either...I have been searching for someone to show me the hidden potential of my natural arches, and Laura did just that.  After only two visits she has groomed my brows into perfect shape and balance. Its funny how such a small change can make such a big difference!  I also enjoy the quiet and private suite with the pretty chandelier to look at during my appointments...and she always has great music playing in the background too! Thanks Laura!"
5,Excellent service and food.  Best tex-mex in the valley.
4,"This is my first dinner stop anytime Im in Scottsdale, and always makes me look good when I recommend it. This time, the standouts were the ceviche, the crab queso, the lamb adobo, and the  Cadillac marg.  Tablemates had other dishes they raved about. Noteworthy notes: Ive not yet sat on the patio, but I cant explain why.  It looks awesome. The margaritas are sufficiently stiff.  Theyre not my preferred carburetor cleaning strength, but neither are they simply jazzed-up lemonade or those super-acidic-1.0 pH version you get some places. The service was a little lax this time, less attentive than before, and thats the only reason Im not giving LS a 5 this time. If youre after Mexican when in Scottsdale, this is the first place to point your ride."
5,"What a beautiful hotel! The Clarendon is truly one of a kind. The staff goes above and beyond to make sure you have everything you need...and extras :) The pool area is gorgeous and the atmosphere is delightful. I had the opportunity to meet the owner, Ben Bethel. What an astonishing young man he is! I dont know which is more impressive, his efforts to make the hotel as ""green"" as possible or the fact that he helps guests with their bags as they walk through the door. I cant wait for another excuse to stay at the Clarendon again!"
3,"Im not a woman and I dont read People magazines at the gym so Im not sure Im really the qualified demo for this place. Nonetheless, in spite of all the hype and hyperbole, its a good cupcake.  When the Olive Oil Vanilla Cupcakes from the Olive Oil mill are too far away, this becomes the cupcake backup.  Especially the vanilla. Id give this place a better review but I dont because I consider the cupcake to be the ""Rodney Dangerfield"" of desserts.  Too many far better post meal options come to mind before Id waste my valuable calorie allotment on a cupcake."
4,"Green is pretty tasty with high marks for the strawberry soy shake. I do agree with the poster below that some items are hit/miss. My ""Artichoke dip"" was way WAY too spicy (I could not eat it). My eggless eggrolss"" were tasty but ..fluffy. They came with a sauce that i enjoyed.  This is one of the essential places for Veg food in the Phoenix area."
5,"Im glad I bought my tickets back in August when the event was first posted.  Im not sure the organizers knew what an amazing turn out they would have but the event was sold out so tickets were not available at the door.  We arrived at 11:15 (doors opened at 11) and while standing in line to get in there was a staff person checking to make sure we all had tickets and letting people know that if they did not, the event was sold out.  Once inside it was a sea of cupcakes!  Tiny cupcakes that were delicious!  I didnt taste one that I didnt like.  Liberty Market was my fave I think.  Espresso Carmel and Red Velvet!  YUM!!!  Cruelty Free Cakes makes delicious vegan cupcakes too!  I also liked the ones from Cry Baby Ranch. Im going to have to find them again at the 20th street Farmers Market and Old Town Scottsdale Farmers Market.  And everyone was so nice!   $10 got you all the cupcakes you could eat and water AND milk!!  And it was for two very worthy causes.  Singleton Moms and Safe Haven For Animals.  There were also raffles, a cupcake eating contest and cupcake decorating for the kids.  So many festivals these days charge you to get in and then, once inside, charge for everything else.  People cant afford that these days so it was refreshing to go to an event and not be nickel and dimed for everything.  I appreciate that.  And best of all my daughter had a great time!  There were lots of people so it was a little overwhelming for her but she loved it.  Both of us are just coming down from our sugar high.   It was great to see Gabi and Lindsey manning the Yelp booth and our very own Thomas S. helping with emcee duties!   Will I be back next year?  You bet!!  And you should come too....just make sure you get your tickets early!"
5,"Talk about an amazing experience...First off the office is well decorated and clean...the staff pleasant and helpful...Rene the hygenist is caring and gentle.  Dr. Keith is really personable and excellent at what he does.  They dont do extra work that doesnt need to be done, they are very honest.  The office takes many kinds of insurance and they are great with kids too!"
2,"Can i just say, i hate everything about this store. If youre too lazy to go to goodwill and dig it out yourself for a third of the price, then i guess this is the place for you.   If you are trying to sell anything, good luck.  Their askew sense of fashion will make most of your goods obsolete unless its tacky 80s regurgitation.  The chick actually told me that the band t-shirts i was trying to pawn were too outdated while i had a bay city rollers  and rockos modern life shirt in my hand off their rack. They are incredibly overpriced, the staff has an elitist air for some reason (which you think would be hard to pull off in a tutu, leggings, and cowboy boots). Saving grace, they have some killer old punk and skateboarding t-shirts on the cheap for guys and gals. But the only time i even go here is when the boyfriend decides to go thru eastside records vinyl catalog in its entirity.  its like a platos closet for lady gaga."
4,"This place is an amazing little find. It serves fresh, delicious noodles for next to nothing. The absolute best part of this place is that you get to pick the kind of noodle you want meaning you can try your favorite dish multiple times while changing it up!"
5,Love Love Love!  All you need to do is order dessert here. It comes in small shot glasses & the flavors explode in your mouth..
5,"Not exactly what I expected ..................I liked it.  I was thinking some sprawling ranch house with wood floors and saw dust everywhere, maybe some old west artifacts on the walls and grumpy old waitresses.  What I got was a cool little funky building, with cool interior and neat things on the walls. More of a sports bar atmosphere with a good sized dining area. Killer staff and great food.  I had a burger, I believe flat grilled, cooked medium rare and I could tell it was good beef. They said they grind it themselves. The fries were great as they are a fresh cut type. The beans were different. They were a lighter vinegary type of bean with onion and bacon. I liked them but could not eat the whole pot that came out.  It ended up being a little expensive. 9 for the burger and Fries, 2.50 for the drink and 1.50 for the beans. Tax and tip it was an 18 dollar lunch."
3,"This review is for the JCPenny portrait studio responsible for the ""Christmas Blessings"" Christmas card that graced my familys and co-workers mailboxes this past holiday season.      My girlfriend and I were going for a ""Step Brothers"" pose so we had to look the part. I guess the look wont be in any Vogue or GQ magazine this year. No, youll have to go back to the time when Circus Magazine was popular and when mom and dad went to key parties.           Our photographer was wonderful. She seemed to enjoy her job and have fun with clients ideas. However the person who helped us pick out which cards to choose was not having any of it. If you looked up awkward in the dictionary and smacked them upside the head thats what it felt like. Her sheer agony of working there oozed out from her forced smile.     Anyways, Ill just say that I am damn happy I had a coupon for a $30 package which included two 8x10s of different poses and a whompin helping of greeting cards. A package that retails at about $170.     And no, even if you pay that price,  a happy ending is not included."
4,"If you like a good burger then check this place out. They have so many options that you can choose from to make your own burger. I am usually not a fan of sweet potato fries, but these ones come with a dipping sauce that is amazing."
4,"I love this store for years now. I discovered it here. The candles are wonderful. I love the little travel sampler kit.  The yuzu bergamot moisturizer is great.  I enjoy the soaps.  This is the type of store that you just go for the product and know it is just going to cost more. Honestly it is not the much for many items: The little kits like the: - cranberry orange body wash 2 oz - cranberry orange moisturizer 2 oz - mint thyme body wash 2 oz - mint thyme moisturizer 2 oz - bamboo creme body wash 2 oz - bamboo creme moisturizer 2 oz - packaged in a reusable zippered bag all for 25 bucks.   clove soap 2 oz - honey almond soap 2 oz - lavender lime soap 2 oz - lemongrass soap 2 oz - oatmeal lavender soap 2 oz  - rosemary soap 2 oz  - rosemary & peppermint soap 2 oz - rose tangerine lavender soap 2 oz - seven seed lemon & rosemary soap 2 oz - vetivert & grapefruit soap 2 oz - wild mint soap 2 oz  - yuzu soap 2 oz for 38 bucks. - bamboo creme moisturizer 2 oz  - mint thyme moisturizer 2 oz  - lavender lime moisturizer 2 oz  - yuzu bergamot moisturizer 2 oz  - cranberry orange moisturizer 2 oz  - sweet almond & sea kelp moisturizer 2 oz  - zippered travel bag  for 25 bucks.. Why yes you just read my Stocking stuffers for myself that I just sent my husband. hehe :D   Worth trying. You will find a favorite.  Quality of their ingredients from their website: ""...using only pure essential oils, vitamins and antioxidants, and rare fruits and herbs - and never using synthetic fragrances or colors. Now, were also sourcing organic ingredients when possible, and are on track to have all of our products be paraben-free and SLS/ALS-free by mid-2010. "" Service: She was very nice and was even happier when she saw I was a little shop happy when I started putting everything on the counter. hehe. From St. Louis and loved it! TLDR:  The products are a favorite of mine. Good products and good service at this location. Great outdoor mall."
5,"Delicious salad, pizza, and wine. We got the Padre pizza which is not on the menu, but fig, prosciutto, arugula, and ricotta... so delicious!! The crust is perfect!  The best part is they have several BOTTLES of wine under $12. Yes, you could usually barely get a glass for that amount. Sold... ! We had the Four Vines ZIn that was amazing for only $10.99."
5,Fast service. Great burgers and fries. So far the Arizona burger coupled with sweet potato fries is my favorite.
4,"Im in town for business and the guy at the front desk of the hotel recommended this place and it was a definite winner! Drove up, and frankly its not in the best neighborhood but the guy in the parking lot keeping watch over the cars in the lot with a ""Security"" t shirt on put me at ease.  Sat down and was welcomed immediately and offered the fresh chips and incredibly hot red and green salsa.  Although, Im kind of a pansy when it comes to hot and spicy.  I Just ate the chips plain and they were wonderful. Had the Chicken Mole Enchiladas which were undeniably the best Ive had.  The mole sauce was perfectly made with just the right amount of chocolate.  I have the stains all over my shirt to prove it!  The beans and rice were nice accompaniments.   Everyone knows the traditional ""Mexican"" restaurants where you go in and order the # 13 and theyre all the same right?  Rositas Place is NOT this type of eatery.  The food is authentic as authentic comes and should not be missed."
1,"Closed on Sunday?  Looks like youve not only lost my Sunday dollars, but my business on Monday through Saturday too."
3,"British pubs arent my favorite places to eat, since I am a vegetarian (who eats fish occasionally), but this place was pretty good. The building was cool and full of character and the service was very friendly. Kim was a great server, even though she was doing it all alone on New Years day! She was very nice and efficient.  The food was pretty good. I got fish and chips, but I dont prefer eating fried stuff often. I do have to say, they were good though. The outdoor seating is nice, but man....those birds are lethal! We got pooped on over and over and even our water was tainted! Not The Rose and Crowns fault, but it kinda ruined our experience.  This looks like a great place to drink, hang out and even watch the game. I am sure its a fun place, but just not my favorite."
5,"Love, love, LOVE this place!  Eugenia is a genius!  Macarons = amazing.  Croissants = soft, buttery, flaky, delicious goodness.  Iced mocha is one of the best I have ever had.  My only complaint is that this place is not closer to my house or work, but thats probably a good thing because I would weigh 1000 lbs if it was."
4,"If you are looking for a serious pool experience, look no further than this hotel. You stay at this hotel for the pool and maybe the surrounding restaurants like Ricos, but especially for the pool. This pool includes: a lazy river, super slide, pool volleyball, miniature golf (yes, mini golf), a western village, at least three pools and plenty of hours of family-fun in the sun. Oh and adult kids are more than welcome too!  This hotel provides the ultimate poolside experience, so if thats what you are looking for, this is your spot. You wont find ""so Scottsdale"" peeps with their stilettos and muscles popping out of their Ed Hardy. You will find down-to-earth people and families wanting to have a good time without worrying about what they look like in a bathing suit.  The Squaw Peak property itself is pretty awesome too. I really think you could stay here and have a weekends worth of activities without leaving the property. Squaw Peak Mtn is just a hop away and perfect for a morning hike, Ive already professed my love to the pool above, they have plenty of restaurants on property including Ricos American Grill which is delicious and Hole-in-the-Wall which is fun old-western fun. They have a gift shop full of fun memorable items, they have a creamery, a general store with breakfast and snack essentials and lets not forget about the multiple tennis courts! As I said, this is a resort. This is an old school AZ resort. Its not frilly but its fun and I think Id take fun or frilly when it includes a pool like this!  PS - summer rates are incredible and start at only $89 a night. Its worth it for a staycation or if youre in town for the weekend."
3,"Not a big fan of the Boba Tea House by Lee Lee. I like their decor, very hip. However, their milk tea mix was not that great. It felt like basic sugared water. Ive had better ones over in Lollicup or Quickly in LA. Its a pretty busy location as it is next to Lee Lees, but unfortunately they definitely arent quite there yet with the competition."
5,"was i ever lucky to pick dr. karawi from a random list of doctors near my home from my insurance website. ever since i was a kid, i barely remember seeing my dentist. his hygienist came in, cleaned my teeth, then the dentist came in with his long nose hairs and big belly and bald head and stinky breath and started shoving sharp metal objects into my teeth. then he left, saying only ""hmmph"". he had a beach house in the cayman islands. dr karawi is exactly opposite of that (dont know if he has a house in the caymans though). what really, really, really surprised me was the karawi cleaned my teeth....the Dentist! he does that for all his patients. i asked him why, and he just said he likes to get to know his patients. how novel! he is extremely friendly and likeable but always professional. he will joke and talk to you about your vacations, plans for the weekend, etc, but then always keeps it serious when discussing your dental care. i sincerely appreciate his services and friendliness. we liked him so much, even invited him to our house warming party! so for excellent dental care and outgoing service, Dr. Karawi is your man. p.s. hes not bald, doesnt have long nose hairs or a big belly, and his breath doesnt stink."
4,"Went there for a second time on Sunday.  The first time I came, I was underwhelmed.  I think the problem was that I went with only one other and this time I came with 5 others.  It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon and over pitchers of Sangria ($20.00 specials on Sunday) and copious amounts of food I rediscovered the restorative quality of good food and great friends.  Had serrano ham and manchego with quince paste, pollo colonial (my favorite), lamb with mustard and mint, pan con tomate, quail with lentils and chicken drumettes.  With the exception of the drumettes (which tasted like overly fancy buffalo wings), the rest of the food was exceptional.  Small portions, yes.  A smidge pricey yet, but the communal feeling of being with your good friends in the open air sharing vino and small plates is priceless."
5,"Only 10 min away from walking distant. This is really really really good, also really really really bad. I am almost finished with trying each soynami.... So far and not a fan of the one with banana. YET EVERYTHING is.... just... just good. Place on top of a Swiss Alp let me sing, dance, and exclaiming goodness oozing.  Also i can eat one and not feel lik I am creating havoc for my metabolism to compensate. RL: NOTE: Oddly takes an unusually amount of time to get into my hands. 10min? Worth the wait, worth the walk, worth the extra chocolate ;)"
5,Good works
5,"Being a very experienced pho eater, I must say that the pho at the BlueMoon is excellent!  That, plus the pho is 50% off, so that must have added to my utility.  Veggies were fresh and the service friendly.  Oh, and the appetizer came out only a minute after ordering.  Meal was hot and came out just as we finished the appetizer. Spent a total of $13.61 (including tax) for (2) large bowls of pho, a Thai ice tea and a order of fresh spring rolls.  Our bellies were stuffed and wallets intact. Will eat here again!"
5,"My fear and avoidance of the dentist has been building for years. However, I simply couldnt put it off any longer. With trepidation I scheduled an appointment at Downtown Dental and promptly received an email back with available times. I went in not knowing what to expect. Not only had the staff already found my insurance information they made a point to call me by the name I go by rather than my formal name and that put me at ease. I sat down with Heather, the hygienist and she was so warm and friendly that I instantly felt fine confessing to her my fear of the dentist. She allayed my concerns and told me not to worry. There was no guilt trip for not flossing or drinking too much soda, which is always annoying. Then the scary part... the dental work. It was uncomfortable and I hated it, but soon it was over, it wasnt that bad and I felt a thousand times better. Dr. Berschler came over and examined me and pointed out a few cavities we needed to take care of. Then the even scarier part (or so I anticipated)...the price! But I was pleasantly pleased and relieved that the total cost after insurance was literally thousands less than Id been quoted by a dentist a year ago to take care of my problems. In fact the total cost is very reasonable; this isnt a dentist looking to take advantage of you. I couldnt have been more pleased and delighted at the friendliness and helpfulness of everyone in the office. The convenient downtown location only makes it better. I will never go to another dentist again and Im actually looking forward to my next appointment. I cant recommend this office enough."
5,"Hands down a great lil joint! Gotta get the guac, staff is awesome, way cozy and great food!"
5,Love this store!
5,Really delicious breakfast burritos! They are true Mexican-style! I get the ham and egg breakfast burrito and it comes with cheese and a fresh tortilla. They are inexpensive and really big! Im so glad I work a mile from this place! I go at least once a week!
2,"Other than the ambiance of being a  Rock & Roll restauarnt, this place isnt good.  The food sucks. I came in for a birthday party with 6 people, and not one of us actually enjoyed our food.  We had called ahead (2 weeks) to reserve a table before a game.  When we got there, the table had not even been set up.  We were 20 minutes later than planned getting to our table, and we missed 1 entire 1st inning and the top of the 2nd because it took so long to get our food."
5,"i know, i know. this gelato is a bit on the pricier side, especially when you consider that phoenix now has a bajillion gelato shops, that  each offer a million and one flavors for a few washingtons. HOWEVER, arlecchino is definitely the BEST. its worth theprice, worth the drive, and worth the parking hassle.  the owners are super nice and accommodating, and although there is a sample limit, the workers have never said no more. the flavors are classic, inventive, fresh, and authentic. plus, its such a cute, tiny little hole-in-the-wall shoppe, that you cant help but love it in all its quaint glory."
3,"Some family were in town and are Blackhawks fanatics desperate to watch the game.  This was the only place in the east valley that we could find had the NHL Center Ice package (though the girl who answered the phone had to ask somebody else (""Whats NHL?"")).  Not only were they kind enough to put the game on, they put it on a flat screen in the corner of the patio and we were able to have the sound on.  He shoots, he scores!   The shepherds pie was good, the beer was cold, and the waitress was very attentive. Ill stick with CKs or the Baseline Pub for the NFL games though.  While RTs had plenty of TVs, most of them were small old tube TVs.  My uncle asked why they werent showing the score of a basketball game, and I told him its just being cut off by the old TVs screen"
5,"We just sold the car we bought at Carmax that spawned the original review here almost three years ago. As with the purchase, the sale was ridiculously simple. The appraisal took about 20 minutes, and came in ABOVE Kelley Blue Book ""excellent condition"" trade in value -- and the car was in good - very good condition, but certainly not excellent. A fair price, and no hassle. At a car dealership. Whod have thunk it?"
4,"being a rather simpleton, i like my salads with lettuce, tomato, and oil and vinegar...my fish simply baked...my veggies raw.... the ice cream here was very tasty. full of fancy flavors and bits-o-ingredients. but i guess if you want plain ice cream, you go to the supermarket and buy a gallon of store brand. we were cruising the greenbelt at night and saw their sign for ""voted best ice cream"" by the new times, so we decided to hit this place up. its super cute and modern, but whats so great about this place is the staff.  our ""server"" was completely into the concept of ""artisan"" ice cream (only in scottsdale can a word like artisan be applied to ice cream...its not simply ""homemade""). she was super passionate and lively and gregarious, which i really like...because i know shes serving a product she enjoys herself and also wants others to enjoy.  i had the peach cobbler one and my girl had the basil sorbet. both were very delicious, but at over 6 bucks for 2 small cups, well probably have to save our dollars for the supermarket next time. if you have the cash to spare for a snack/dessert, check this place out."
4,"By FAR one of my favorite places to have breakfast. The intimate setting gives off the ""mom and pop"" breakfast joint feel you might find in a beach town. The menu accomodates for the health-conscious but breakfast-loving eater. The only reason why I knocked it down a point is the wait. Unless you go during the weekdays or early morning on the weekends, expect to wait upwards to 45 minutes. My suggestions... their egg white omelets and for those coffee lovers, you HAVE to try the BC coffee!"
5,"I picked up some brownies as holiday treats this year and they did not disappoint!  These are the richest, chocolatiest, moistest, biggest (3"" square) brownies you will find!  Im tellin ya! TOTALLY worth the drive to Gilbert - except theyre taking their own holiday break right now, so youll have to wait until after Jan. 4, 2010 to get your fix! Still, worth the drive and worth the wait!!"
4,Cool place in downtown!  Ive been to all of the iterations of the restaurant and all of them have been pretty cool.  The happy hour is a great deal and the bartenders are really nice.
5,"We are picky about food because we try to eat healthy. Owner and server were very accommodating and courteous. They took time to understand what we want and delivered on it. One gripe, we had difficulty finding it because neon sign was not working. We had a great experience."
5,I stayed at the Motel right across the street from this restaurant when I stayed in Gila Bend. I had been driving all day through the hot desert and really wanted to kick back with a cold beer and some good food. Little Italy did not disappoint!! I got a large pizza that was AMAZING!! Plus the service was great too. Fast and friendly.
4,"We get a date night rarely throughout the year, so I try and find something new when ever we get that chance. Once we made it into the restaurant we were both quite pleased with the decor and the atmosphere, little did we realize that this was just the beginning! The wait staff here is beyond friendly and knowledgeable, our server Sam was what you would consider first class in every aspect. His attention and knowledge started our evening off in such a way that I feel indebted to him!! Then comes the food....! We had a four course meal that not only included a wine pairing for two of the courses, but also a pre-dinner cocktail. The food was exquisite, the pork chop with the kale and pickled onion main course was grand, and the paired wine could not have been better."
5,"Gosh Darn It! They had to be good. I was hoping, since they are so close to my home  and right next to where I shop for groceries most often (Fresh & Easy), that theyd be horrible. Then Id never have to go again... But, alas...too good to not go back, thats for sure! Ive said it before, Ill say it again: if you dont like a lot of frosting, just wipe off the portion you dont want. Heck, if youre sitting next to me and my kids, theyll eat it for you!! I didnt think I was much of an frosting fan either so I wiped off most from the Chocolate Chip Caramel, only to find that the milk chocolate frosting covered with a caramel drizzle was UH-MAZING! Scraped that heap right back in my mouth where it belongs! Yum. Equally impressive it the dense, moist cake (as opposed to light and fluffy texture; these puppies are HEAVY). The White Chocolate Raspberry was chock-full of white chocolate chips and the frosting was not too sweet. It was the prettiest one as well, with white sprinkles and raspberry sauce drizzle. Thoroughly enjoyed the two other chocolate selections (Texas Milk Chocolate & Midnight Magic) as well--Yes! I had four, but only cut them in half so I could save the rest for (my husband) later. Bonus points for presentation (the box is adorable) and variety."
4,"3.5 stars Came here for HH on a Tuesday. Loved the ambience, sort of a beachy type feel. We ordered all the appetizers listed for HH, including the sliders, grilled cheese sandwich, wings (buffalo), and bruschetta. Food was decent, my favorite being the grilled cheese sandwich. A nice place to wind down with good company."
3,"First time eating Cambodian food. I am not sure what its supposed to taste like so its hard to say if this is what cambodian food is.... Small, quiet place. Entrance was non-initutive to us for some reason, we walked in the kitchen. Its the door on the left if anyone was curious.  On a Monday at lunch, we were the only people in there around noon.  I didnt know what to order but I like shrimp so I went for it. I went  for the Shrimp Ling rice combo. It comes with soup, rice and a pickled salad.  The dish comes on a nice square plate so it makes the food 50x fancier just because its on a square plate. Lots of shrimp in my plate ~ about 10ish and theyre large. The shrimp was grilled and it tasted good but I wouldnt call it amazingly good that I was in love. I ate it and I like it but I thought to myself What is Cambodian food because the flavors dont seem unique? It seems like they grilled it in some soy sauce, maybe sugar, added more salt and maybe one or two other spices."" FYI - Theres bunch of green onions in the shrimp, I think they add that more flavor. They arent chopped into small pieces, its like the whole stem but I ate everything. I always eat everything - I dont waste my food (its almost like a sin not to finish your food unless you take it home... so nevermind). The pickled salad was refreshing. I like the soup, it was lukewarm and it reminded me of a Chinese wintermelon homecooked soup. Its like a mixed of Chinese style chicken broth with Vietnamese beef broth without the saltiness and msg. Adding the green onions to the soup definitely makes it 50x better as well - WOOHOO.  My dish was $8 - pretty good price. Thumbs up to that! Overall, would I go back? Eh - I dont know. I need to try other Cambodian places or maybe I should just have googled about it...maybe Vietnamese food is better? Apparently, the countries are located near each other so its similar to Vietnamese food."
4,"The Parlor is one of my go to favorites when Im craving pizza, going on a first date or have friends and family in town.  I always have a serious conflict between the margarita pizza v. the pesto pizza. They are both sooo good. Lately Ive been going for the margarita with a side of marinara side. Usually pair it with caesar salad."
2,"I know... I know... its Phoenix but I expected something far better.  Perhaps my mistake.  Located in what looks like an old fast food location this is a no frills, no cart, and no nonsense dim sum experience.  Dont think I will be going back (for many reasons) but if you are craving some bao or need a dumpling fix this place will do... just dont expect much."
4,"OK, Im somewhat between 3 stars and 4 stars on this.  I really want to like this restaurant a lot so maybe I will have to return again and try another dish. Positives: Price!!!!  Wow, the prices are amazing.  I got the hand pulled spicy noodle dish ($4.00), my boyfriend got the hand pulled pork noodles ($5.95) and we shared the pork dumplings ($4.95). The dishes provided rather generous portions (we ended up taking half of our meals to go).   The dumplings were quite tasty (approx 8 large dumplings) I got the passion fruit smoothie with boba which was quite good (I love bubble tea so much and this place is pretty legit). The restaurant was really clean and the window to watch the noodles being made was really interesting and ingenious! Negatives: My noodle dish just really didnt have a whole lot of flavor and was not even remotely spicy for being titled spicy noodles.   All of the food was really rather greasy.  The sauce for the noodles was pretty much pure oil and the dumplings/sauce were pretty oily too (but still tasty).  I was just hoping for a bit of a cleaner feeling meal instead of heavy greasy food.  Maybe if I try one of the soup dishes next time I will have better luck!   The experience was overall a good one and I would like to try this place again, I was just a bit disappointed with the grease content of the foods which gave me a bit of stomach ache.  Regardless, this place is worth a shot!"
3,"I hate the heat. HATE. Yet I am doomed to reside in this heat haven so when my best friend raved about a place where you can sit outside in Arizona and not feel the heat I had to check it out. By the time I ventured downtown to glance at this place Phoenix was experiencing a cool down so the patio was very comfortable without the fans and misters.  Our waitress was great and even chatted about our night and my favorite bar, SideBar. We got the L.B. favorite lavosh and I okayed the bacon even though it didnt sound too appetizing. It wasnt. I ordered some chicken sandwich that was on a french roll. The salad on the side was better than the sandwich. My friend ordered the classic turkey which was large but average. BUT I think ordering the classic sandwich was a boring mistake of its own. The fries that came with the turkey were greasy and when I ordered a amber ale and some guy brought a pale ale. I like pale ale so it wasnt too bad but it made me yearn for the amber. Yes, or course I ordered the amber next. The waitress told us that the island bar was opening the next day but there were still ladders and paint cans lying around. I failed to notice until my friend mentioned it. The only really cool thing about this place is that it is in a historic building with strange bathrooms. Other than that I would skip it."
2,New and big yes... but not my favorite spring training park. 5 stars for being big and roomy and also lots of grass in the outfield 2 stars for being almost like a major league park. Feels like you are attending a MLB regular season game. They lost out on the small spring training feel and intimacy. 0 stars for being the only cactus league park I visited this spring not allowing you to bring in food like candy or peanuts or sunflower seeds. You realize why when you see the pricey beer and food vendors inside.
5,"Baiz Market is a ""Mediterranean"" type restaurant, or ""Arabic"" type food. Well, you could get confused and call it that. The fact of the matter is though, that this place has a very unique touch. This restaurant is a staple not only for groceries, but also its food. The owner is persian, so you can tell where the tastes are coming from. Its somewhat hidden in the heart of Phoenix, but thats ok, once you are there you will be glad you found it. This place is unique because they make their own bread! Are you kidding me? I only recently found out about this place like 3 years ago, and Ive been living in Phoenix for 20 years. The chicken and beef shawarma have a special, authentic taste because of the fresh bread. One of the best parts about the shawarma is not only its amazing taste, but the pricing is very fair as well. I dont think I can stress this enough, but the fresh bread just sets this place apart from all the impostors in the Phoenix metro area. Why havent the other restaurants caught on? I know of maybe one persian restaurant that makes their own bread, but their pricing makes them a different story (Im talking about The Persian Room in Scottsdale). I just dont understand how other restaurants can serve the bread that comes in plastic bags from a manufacturer hundreds of miles away. Good bread and Arabic bread are all good forms of pita that have great shelf life due to the ridiculous amounts of preservatives, but they just dont taste fresh. If you like the bread, head to the back of the store and there is a shelf of freshly baked pita bread, its baked throughout the day, I think. I can tell because sometimes my bread is still warm and the bag has a little condensation. Beware though, the bread gets hard and crunchy after a few days, so you really need to use it quickly. This isnt bad, its just I think they choose not to add preservatives to ensure the freshness of the pita. I usually just get the chicken or beef shawarma, but I decided Id get a kabob plate one day because I also wanted hummus. The beef kabob plate came with hummus, bread, 2 skewers of beef kabob, and some pickles and onions. Wow. The beef kabobs were cooked perfectly, and were EXTREMELY tender. It was a tad bit on the lemony side, but I suppose that was necessary to make it so tender. Perhaps some of the best persian kabobs I have ever had. The hummus was definitely good as well, I cant stand restaurants that crack open a can of premade hummus. This restaurant certainly did not disappoint with the hummus. I know friends in Tucson that make stops specifically at this place for shawarma, and rightly so. If youre weary of persian food, just check this place out. Its not expensive at all, food for two is like $15. The wide variety of ethnic foods is also interesting."
5,We have been back several times since my initial review and the service and food have been consistently excellent for both lunch and dinner. Love their green chiles!!!
5,"If its good enough for Britney, its good enough for me.  Which I guess isnt saying much these days...  But trashy ole Brit knew what she was doing when she booked a room at Sanctuary.   This resort truely is a Sanctuary--the pool, complete with negative edge, in-water matching rafts for guests, and a top notch waitstaff was my favorite spot.  Had a gotten a chance to experience the spa, which Ive heard is one of the best in town, I may have taken up residence there. I stayed here as a reward for work with a bunch of girls--we had a suite--a sweet suit eactually, complete with 3 bedrooms, kitchen living room, etc.  We even had a cute bellboy who watched parts of the NBA finals with us.  Now thats service.   Plush robes, a balcony with a perfect mountain view, and egyptian cotton sheets.  Loveitloveit. At night we went to Elements which is the very up-scale restaurant and bar at the resort.  It deserves its own review so Ill write a seperate one, but know that its exceptional and the view is amazing.  A great date spot for even those who arent spending the night at the hotel."
5,"Great activity for kids. Its clean, spacious and safe."
3,"Okay, its a nice place but Im not sure I would drive out of my way to go here. I was in town on business staying nearby and thought Id give them a try. The food was good, but not great. The shredded beef taco was typical and the shredded pork burrito tasted more like beef. The red chili sauce had an okay flavor but the heat level seemed to simply over power everything (and I like hot). The restaurant is very nice inside, very upscale. I guess if you wanted to spend alot for a Mexican dinner in a very nice setting this would be the place. Service was so so, maybe it was because I was a party of one. Whatever the reason, it wasnt a happening thing. Hey, at least the salsa was tasty."
3,I didnt try any food hear but this place seems like it has a split personality. Tons of tvs showing sports so sports bar. At the same time theres a dj blasting club music. There werent that many people dancing. We went here because the place next door had a huge line. One plus is that theres a second bar near the patio that we stuck by. This place to me was...meh.
5,"Dont judge a book by its cover.  The outside doesnt look so great, but you go inside and its gorgeous.  The food is some of the best food Ive ever eaten.  Their sugar cane chicken appetizer is fantastic!! The pad thai, chiang mai noodles, pad kra po, pad lard na, etc.  This place is so flavorful with fresh veggies and fresh herbs.  And dont get me started on their fried honey banana dessert.  The best dessert Ive ever had!  Check this place out you will not be disappointed."
1,"Decided to give Tempe Marketplace another try after reading recent reviews (hoping that they had improved). I had to ask myself if we were visiting the same place. The traffic and parking situation are still horrible and the loudspeakers in the parking lot are unacceptable. The JC Pennys and Targets are crippled versions of their regular stores at other malls. The stores here all open too late (11am, REALLY???) to be useful in our uber hot summers (except for a Targets that opens at 8am).  Even though I am a Tempe resident, I will continue to choose the Riverview shopping area on Dobson over this mish-mashed monstrosity."
4,"Ive been to China Magic Noodle many times over the years; its one of my husbands favorite places to eat. The employees are friendly and prompt to provide service. I always get #34 (Beef, Noodles, w/XO sauce) or the #27 (Seafood Noodle Soup) and love both. The noodles plates are big; unless you are a big eater, expect to take some home. The mango smoothie w/boba is also delicious; you can taste the fruit and know its fresh. I agree w/some of the other reviewers regarding the smell - this place definitely has a ""smell"" to it, who knows what it is - but its not a disgusting/offensive smell. Overall the place is clean, the service is good, and the food is great!"
4,"Run by the Mormons, they keep it really well stocked and organized. I got a couple of cool chairs there, a pair of fake leather cowboy boots, 3 belted pencil skirts, 4 or 5 pairs of chunky 80s earrings, a mans plaid shirt that fits me perfectly, countless other things. It is a thrift store, so there are the usual things that would take away from the experience, but the prices are reasonable and not fixed by item, like Goodwill. Ive seen some really nice living room couches, sets, even, but never had a need. At one point, they had 40 or 50 framed prints of the same 5 paintings, one is a Van Gogh floral still life with a green background. Id never seen it, my mom picked one up, though.  I am a masochist, so I love to peruse the ""As-Is"" and the yard where they keep a lot of bigger, crappier stuff."
5,"Ive eaten here twice, and both times enjoyed myself immensely.   First, note that this is the smaller location; the one in Mesa has more tables and space. This one is closer to me, so this is the one I go to, but if you are looking to have a large group, you may wish to go to the Mesa location.    That said, I really like this one. The mood is very raw, because of the small size, even at a table you can see the cooks behind the bar, hear the clatter and clang of the kitchen. That said, you can still have conversations here without issue; you just have a bit of background noise.    The food, though...the food is spectacular. Seriously, look at that menu, look at those pictures. The first time I was there I had the chicken tikka masala pasty. Not as good chicken tikka as a straight up Indian restaurant, of course, but still phenomenal, and the pasty just made it that much better. I also snagged the bananoffee pie. It could easily provide dessert for two people; I ate the whole thing. It was just that good. Not too sweet, very banana-y...    Eat here. Its really that simple.     Also, as a tip, theres a parking lot round the back that is usually not full, unlike the one on the front. And, though the address is off of University Drive, the front is really facing Hardy. Threw me a bit the first time I was looking for it."
5,"This is place is a weekly trip for us as my girlfriend loves the salmon and martinis they serve here. We have been frequenting this place ever since we moved to the area versus the rare trips we would take for the awesome cream cheese chocolate cake made by Caroline or the lunch Caesar chicken sandwich. Here are my ratings of each dining point I consider when going here: Service: 5/5 Fast and very helpful, Even the chef will dig up custom stuff and cares what people think of the new entrees. Ambiance: 4/5 The place used to be a home so its a little cramped but nice nonetheless. Not as comfy as some others like Ticoz but we like it. As it is small in seating ranges you cant get too loud so keep the rowdy folks to the Applebees locales. Drinks: Ginger ale and the kiltlifter is nice as well as the blackwidow and black / blue martinis. recommended Food: Fish 5/5: My girls favorites are the halibut,swordfish,miso salmon with basmati rice, she also loves the spinach and asparagus. Sandwiches: 5/5 for roast chicken with green chili, side of coleslaw or balsamic salad 4/5 chicken caesar is good but sometimes is hit and miss meatloaf: 5/5 best I have ever had, it is a beauty. Tacos: 4/5 One time I had pork tacos they were the best ones I had tasted, the next time they were ok, then the last time they were great, not sure why but still recommended. Cream cheese cake: 5/5 Made from local baker who used to do deserts for Circa 1900 but now does it for them and Urban Bean to name a few. Steak,chicken, pork: 3/5 I have tried each and every one here and while you wont be disappointed there isnt a wow factor like the meatloaf. The sauces seem to not match or compliment the specific meat in my opinion. I would love a bordelaise sauce or onions and mushrooms with the filet for example. Appetizers: ?/? I am not a fan of  the bruschetta but havent tried the rest. I have heard the crab cakes are awesome but have yet to compare them to Fezs awesome versions. Pricing is on par with Sophies but less than Christophers and more that Ticoz. I am fine with it as the food I order is totally worth it."
2,"I finally got the chance to visit Lola on my way home from a poetry reading at the Phoenix Art Museum Last night..(Side note: If you get the chance to see Aaron Johnson read, do so.) I somehow feel the need to appologize for the lack of stars to all of you who seem to love this place. I would certainly be willing to give it another try but I was not impressed. First the music is loud, and therefore everyone talking in the place turns up the volume and as my girlfriend and I were seated across from each other at the communal table we could barely reach to share the food let alone hear each other. Why are the tables so big if the food is so small? Maybe I am a bit of a glutton, but for 8 dollars I essentially ate a mushroom for dinner...Dont get me wrong it was tasty, and I understand Tapas are appetizers, but 8 dollars? I was disapointed. I used to go to Firefly in Vegas and it was cheaper and tastier. We just wanted to try this place and move on someplace quieter, but I was really looking forward to it...We decided not to have drinks and simply share one thing so we could get to said quieter place before it got too late...I think because we ordered so little, the waitress considered us a waste as far as her tips were concerned and therefore seemed not so friendly...and those little bitty glasses of water they bring...I drank immediately and it was never refilled.  I was overall not impressed by anything except a patrons sweet ass Salvador Dali Mustache. I can see the charm there and I probably will give it another shot but based on this trip 2 stars is fairer than fair."
1,"Closed... GONE UNDER, OUTTA HERE.. See ya later, bye bye.."
4,"Sub Factory is one of the better sub shops in Tempe - They have been around forever and have a reputation of using the highest quality, freshest ingredients. They may need to give this location a ""make-over"" soon though... its getting a little tired. (FYI - their secret weapon is their bread)"
5,"Great views, great food, great service and great atmosphere!  We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner here and couldnt believe the neighborhood special - 3 courses for $35! The split pea soup was amazing as well as the bing cherry cheesecake...yum!"
4,"I dig this place, I really do, but the portions are small. They do make up for it  by packing a straight kick to your man or woman pleaser with zesty flavors. I didnt dig the guacamole-too much salt, but loved, loved, loved the chips that came with it. The place is quite spacious and modern with featured art on the walls. I went for dinner so the lighting was minimal giving the place a sexy, urban feel to it. The kind of lighting that makes you wonder if the people are really this good looking? Or is the lighting really just this good???  The carne asada beef tacos were divine. Really moist and succulent with just enough spice to make your taste buds tingle. Two is hardly enough, so we also tried the fish tacos and well, I could smell the fishiness from across the table which makes me a little uncomfortable. I did try it, though and it was okay. Not too fond of anything that tastes or smells too fishy. Reminds me of unsanitized, dirty, dirty girls. (Haha, had to throw in a visual for you all!) My favorite plate was the ensalada cortada. I loved all the ingredients mixed in together, especially the corn nuts. Genius idea!  For drinks, I had the la sangria. Fruity, refreshing, and light tasting. It was really good, but I passed it on to my date in hopes of taking advantage of him later on. Almost worked, but when we got to the normally secluded rooftop @ the Clarendon hotel, they were hosting a social gathering of some sort with lots of people. Damn. Shouldve drank my sangria. Oh well...another day since I will most definitely be back for some more Gallo Blanco. I cant wait to try their breakfast menu!"
5,"This is by far the best farmers market Ive been to in the Valley.  Still small by comparison to LA and the Bay Area but is off to a great start with lots of potential and space to grow into. McClendon has a great spread of high quality mainly organic produce and is constantly restocking so its ok if you dont get there first thing.  It was exciting to see beautiful Tuscan kale and broccoli rabe at prices lower than Sprouts.  Meyer lemons and blood oranges were also available. Phoenicians outstanding loaves were only $3. Youre welcome to sample - we particularly liked the Olive Walnut and Dark Chocolate Cherry. We enjoyed Digestifs Frittata ($4) made with thin layers of potato, eggs, pork belly and spinach.  Other combinations available were Dandelion with Goat Cheese and Mushrooms with Garlic Confit. Executive Chef Payton Curry is also there to demonstrate pulling fresh mozzarella which is served with a variety of sauces and toppings, It was fun walking around this bustling market sampling food, like tamales, which we intend to come back for next week.  If I can get myself out of bed at a decent hour on Sat, Ill be here for sure every week until the season ends in May."
5,"I am sad that Luckys is so far from where we live.  I worked near Luckys last year and just happened to walk in for lunch.  My lunch was so good I took a huge meat lovers pie home, which was so good my husband proposed all over again! The employees were so friendly and explained that their pizza might take a little longer than normal, but they want to make sure its right.  I loved everything about my visit there, and was able to stop in a couple more times throughout the year.  Its about an hour drive from where I live, but the more I think about it, I think were going to have to go get some more Luckys pizza.  Great neighborhood pizza place!"
3,"Thought Saturday night would be busy at 6:00 PM, but to our surprise it was just getting started. We dont like to go there too often because it seems that a lot of older folks go there, not that Im a ""spring chicken"". The waiter was efficient, he never told us his name but memorized our order. He made sure we had our drink glasses filled at all times. When he brought out the bread, it was only three pieces of different types: roll, carrot bread and another type. We had to ask for another order. My daughter had the Chicken Pot Pie which had chunks of chicken but the sad part, the crust was only on the top, which was golden brown. To her it was OKAY. My wife had the petite sirloin steak which came with a salad and asparagus. She ordered it medium rare and it was a little too pink, but still eatable. My order was the Lamb Shank on top of mashed potatoes and asparagus. Love asparagus!! The lamb was okay and portion was just right. The sauce that was poured over the lamb was like beef stew gravy with carrots and celery. The sauce was a bit salty for me but bearable. If you looked at the lamb shank you would mistaken it for a turkey drumstick."
3,"I will preface this by saying that I went here a couple years ago for lunch and thought it was very good, which gave it an extra star over my true opinion of my dinner there last night. The BF and I went here before seeing Louis CK for our anniversary. We were seated right away, so that was nice, but it was like 5:45 so that isnt too shocking. We sat outside, which was nice and had pretty christmas lights on all of the trees. The waiter comes by after about 5 minutes and asks us for drinks or apps and we ordered the burrata as an app. The menu said it was topped with a balsamic glaze, which sounded wonderful. We were also ready to order our pizza but the waiter disappeared immediately after taking our app order. So we wait. and wait. and wait. And I swear it felt like it was a half hour, but it was probably more like 10-15 minutes later (we were super hungry) the waiter came back to take our pizza order. We ordered the La Noce and he left. Well.... we waited some more. Finally got our burrata and it was a mess. Two giant globs of cheese with the lightest drizzle of balsamic dressing (not vinegar, because there is no way this weak stuff was straight up vinegar) surrounded by bread and prosciutto. It was large, so Ill give them that.... but too large in my opinion, because there isnt enough bread for the toppings. The burrata was good, creamy.... but it didnt taste like balsamic at all, which was the most appealing part of the app. The prosciutto was alright... it didnt have a ton of flavor, but it was fine. The bread had a burnt flavor... not my fave. Then we wait about 20 minutes.... waiter did not check on us.... Finally get the pizza. The pizza was good. That was the redeeming item of the night. It had arugula, walnut, ricotta, and mozz. It was a tasty combination.  Now, the whole time we were there, there was a table of about 6-8 extremely loud, drunk, possibly old sorority girls sitting near us. All we could hear is their conversation, so much so, that we knew one girl was named rochelle and one was Tina and one had been divorced for 4 years and they had a friend named Lori who was just sooo crazy among many other details that we should not have gathered from sitting in their proximity, which obviously puts a damper on the experience. The waiter was so occupied with them, that we felt forgotten about all night. He was not attentive, he did not ask how things were, and he disappeared for long periods of time to go do who knows what for this other table (they had a bunch of ridiculous requests like splitting the bill 6-8 ways when the menu says they dont do that... hmmm). We sat down at 5:45 and barely got out of there around 7 to make it to our show (we were walking). So the experience wasnt a good one, BUT I would be willing to try it again, as I did have a very nice lunch there a few years ago."
3,Decent food at a good price. Bargain lunch specials in a good atmosphere.
4,this is not in the mall dq a real road side flash back
4,"Theres something deliciously seventeen about drinking in ""The Alley.""  Of course, real seventeen year olds cant get in.  This place is legit, but the vibe is very Lloyd Dobler in a gas station parking lot asking a bunch of punk kids why he just cant win with women.  (Dont worry Lloyd none of us really have that figured out and most of us who seem to be doing it successfully are really just faking it.) The crowd here varies but I have always felt welcome.  Drinks are ok.  Sometimes theyre great but it depends on whos tending bar.  The good thing is theyre fairly cheap.  As a music venue I give it  high five.  Its dirty and dark with a one foot high stage thats obviously meant for performance but not so far removed as to make you feel like youre not connected to whats going on.  The sound is ok.  It depends on the show really but Ive always had a good time and that counts for a lot. I like the pictures on the ceiling. Theyre fun to try to decipher when youre setting yourself on spin cycle.  The pool tables are usually full so I cant really vouch for them other than to say that theyre popular.  All in all, its a decent place to pummel yourself in the face with your beverage of choice."
4,"Very good noodle shop.  I got referred here on my second day in town by the folks at Fujiya.  They were right.  I went for lunch and I almost could have missed it, tucked away in a little corner in a shopping plaza.  But the outside appearance belied the cute interior.  I am waiting for it to get cold out (or even mildly less than scorching) so I can go in for some Ramen!!  Real Ramen - nothing like it.  This trip I had Tempura and some cold noodles. - Good stuff."
3,"The first thing I respect about Rula Bula is its ability to attract customers while keeping a low profile. No flashing lights, no 400 pound bouncers with angry stares, and no promotional cards being shoved in my face from down the street. I walked in and liked what I saw. It has an old school feel to it. There was a live band doing some Lady Gaga covers, and it sounded like karaoke. I wasnt impressed, so I ordered my Jameson (reasonably priced) and walked out to the patio. It was a good patio, with a DJ in the corner. It had a different feel to it, and I appreciate how laid back it was. But it felt like something was missing. I waltzed back inside, admired a much better cover (of Micheal Jackson) and realized the one thing I couldnt find here.  FUN. To a west-sider like myself, Tempe is the Mecca of mischief, a place where I can have one too many and stumble back home with a story to tell. There was a dance floor, but no one was dancing. There were tons of people, but every group kept to themselves. Even though I dont go to bars to meet women, there was a suspicious lack of pretty ones in here. Its like everyone who was too old or uncool to go elsewhere came to have a Guinness in peace. I came here expecting a fun bar that wasnt a full-blown club, and instead of getting a happy medium I ended up with a boring dive. Dont get me wrong, I fucking LOVE dive bars, but I dont go to Mill Ave for them. Rula is a good place with good history. I cant hate on it. I love the interior, and I could see myself coming back during the day. Its just not worth going out of my way on a Saturday night."
4,"This is the only music store on my side of town and since I never can buy online early enough, is where I usually buy my reeds. The customer service is great and they appear to have a huge selection of almost everything a music student should need."
2,"the promise of homemade turkey and roast beef drew me in, much to my dismay its shredded. As Ramsey would say like a dogs dinner!. I got the bobby with roast beef, so i could taste both. The bread was good, the stuffing was cold. The meat was chokingly dry. Dry dry. Sawdust tasting. Im sure the other non shredded meats are great on that bread, this might as well had just been the stuffing and cranberries on the bread. Plus, the manager was bragging about how he just stands around and does nothing but micro manage. Donkeys! Lol. Make that guy clean the bathrooms!"
5,"This is a family owned local restaurant at its best. If you like to explore and support locally owned businesses, you should definitely give this one a try. They have a big menu and I have tried breakfast and lunch and both were excellent, but the breakfast is particularly good. I love the breakfast burrito. (to the reviewer that complained about the greasy chorizo...hello, it is chorizo, chorizo is sausage). I would go out of my way to stop and eat here whenever in the general area."
4,"Great atmosphere with interesting lights (look like white jellyfish). Got a Chicken piccata which was delicious. TVs were conveniently placed so we were able to watch the World Series Games. Overall, a fun place to catch up with friends."
4,"Ok its a chain, so theres that...  But Im like Broman and we luv us a good sammich!   And Capriottis didnt disappoint there. I went at an odd time and had the place to myself, it was quite clean and instead of just hanging out BSing the people were busy taking care of the place. So the menu - short and sweet, thats how I like it.  Unlike a place like the friggin Cheezecake Crapory with its 80,000 menu items, none of them done well, Capriottis keeps it under control and turns out a tasty sammy.   I had the turkey sub with spicy peppers, mmm mmmm.  I love the fresh roasted turkey like that, and the ""just like grandma made"" pickles.  Well not like either of my grandmas made, but someones grandma...  The veggies passed the fresh & crispy test with flying colors and the sub roll was perfectly soft and chewy. Ya its slightly on the higher end fast sandwich price range, but its quality and pretty filling.  I made 2 meals out of the 9"", with the meal deal right around $10.   I have a Groupon for the place and cant wait to take my good friend and get him hooked.  Next victim on my list:  the Bobbie!!"
1,"Cold, under done chips. If a Mexican food restaurant can not get this staple right how can I expect them to get much more right.  I arrived for a party that my autocross group was having. Every table had chips and salsa on it. Sombreros were used as the server platters. Senor I dont think this even meets health code.  Dinner was served Buffet Style, one of the dishes was called ""fandito."" I cant think of a less inspired dish. It was simple pasta with some Mexican flavors thrown it, a dish that your mother would make if she had leftovers from Mexican Italian nights.  I like really like Mexican food, however I left this place hungry as I did not even want to try any of the dishes other than the salad."
2,"An Ode to Walmart: Its Walmart A senior citizen handing out carts at the door.  My cart doesnt roll straight.  Im not surprised.  There are no baskets, just carts.  Is that a hint? Its Walmart. More babies than a daycare.  More seniors than a senior center.  And tattoos for everyone. Its Walmart. Cardboard kingdoms of snacks, a tower of cheese balls bigger than you head for $5.98 each, a wall of ramen labeled ""Cup-O-Soup,"" and a kid putting cheese balls bigger than your head into his familys cart. Its Walmart. Fifty cent clearance plastic margarita glasses.  A crate of $5 DVDs bigger than my bathtub.  The PA announces ""All loaders, code 60.  All loaders, code 60."" Its Walmart. A pharmacy, vision center, credit union, grocery store, hair dresser, automotive section, toy store, bike shop, Home Depot, and Office Depot all under one roof.  I think I got lost twice. Its Walmart. Profits measured one penny at a time.  Is Walmart a savior for the poor or does Walmart enable poverty?  Economist cant decide.  Does Walmart help the environment by working with vendors to reduce and remove packaging, and engaging in some environmental friendly projects.  Environmentalists have decided. Its Walmart. Self-checkout with a weight sensor to keep you honest.  Theyve never checked my receipt at the exit.  Is it because Im white? Its Walmart. Patrons leave their carts at the bus stop.  Where did that hour of my life go?"
2,"The kids and I LOVE Starbucks but this one leaves a lot to be desired.. We have been here a hand full of time and each time I keep asking myself why do I go back to this one?  The service there is almost rude. They seem as if they are annoyed to be busy. They never seem to be happy to service you. Drinks take forever to make, even though they arent as busy as other ones are. We wont even go into the fact that my order has been messed up the last 2 times. The main issue I have is the fact that 3 out of 5 times when sitting and relaxing with a snack, someone has to sweep the floor near me. Really? While I am sitting there? There are much better Starbucks and I think I am going to try some others locally. 12/06 - The kids and I went in today for our ""snack"" wanted to say things were better today. I am not going to change my rating until after my next visit ;)"
1,just say no. this place is truly awful.  too bad its taking up valuable space on monroe.
5,"Gosh-Awful-Gooey Banana Split: fresh banana split lengthwise, Turkish coffee ice cream blanketed with caramel sauce, red raspberry sorbet smothered in marshmallow sauce with delicious whip and a juicy maraschino cherry atop. Heaven!!"
5,"I went there last night with bf to celebrate our anniversary. After pre-yelp, we knew what to expect as to prices, so it wasnt so much of a shocker. To the food, we concur with almost everyone here. It was impeccable! We ordered the ice tower for 2 and thought that it was very well presented. Ours came with 3 appetizers (raw oysters, crab claws and dungeness crab) so it wasnt too high. They are all fresh. Growing up I used to go to the beach quite often just to have fresh crabs, so I know what those taste like. And for 6 years living in the desert, Mastros is the first and only one in AZ to deliver that.   For main course, I got Ivory Salmon ""Oreganata"", bf got Swordfish blackened. I am quite picky when it comes to fish, and bf isnt exactly a fish person, but both of our dishes ""surpassed expectation."" I couldnt say much about swordfish except it was fresh. We had the same dish 2 weeks before at somewhere else, it was nowhere near as sweet and fresh as the one at Mastros. It was my first having Ivory Salmon, it was sweeter, and white (hence the name) than normal salmon we get around here. Mine was good size portion, firm to the touch, but melted in the mouth. The flavor was subtle enough to enjoy by itself, or you can add one of the sauces provided. One of my favorite sauces of the night I think was made of minced tomatoes and olives, came with the main course. Sides were Lobster Mash and Snap peas. I didnt really care for snap peas as I can make them at home. But lobster mash is a MUST for those who go there. Im not sure how they prepared it, but it felt like mash potatoes made with lobster bisque (instead of water and milk) and added lobster chunks. It was much more flavorful and creamy than a normal mash potatoes. It was big enough to share and take home. One thing though, it hardened up after sitting out for awhile, so Im not sure if microwave could make it all fluffy again after 1 night in the fridge. Drinks there are amazing, from the presentation, to the taste, and definitely the amount of alcohol in each drink. We decided to go with cocktail drinks rather than wines because of other yelpers reviews. Total worth it!!! The service was amazing. We had Robert. We pretty much asked him for recommendations for everything, yet he was nice about it and very knowledgeable. Next time we go back, I would definitely ask for him again. We didnt order dessert since they gave us a dark-chocolate ""Happy Anniversary"" cake with the letters written, also, in chocolate. The overall experience was 4 3/4, just because it was a bit difficult talking to each other. The acoustic of the room wasnt very good and it got loud. Didnt see much of cougar/manther scene as we were in the dining room. And maybe it was during weekdays, we saw lots of ""expense account"" people though"
3,"Tilted Kilt is alright. I have been here a few times and what stands out in my mind is nice decor with many tvs, good beer selection, but crappy service and food. I am really big on service, coming from the industry for over 7 years, so when I get bad service, I get in a bad mood. The girls are pretty lucky they are hot because I dont think it would fly otherwise. The fish n chips I had were not good, obviously just poured from a bag, which is disappointing. I felt the server was really flaky and inattentive, she was sitting with a group of guys pretty much the whole time, while I was waiting for my napkins, then my malt vinegar, ugh. Then she came to tell us she was going on a smoke break and I dont think I saw her after that. All in all, I can appreciate a cute girl in sexy kilts (I was actually hired to work here when they first opened) and I love me some good beers and flat screens, but I will pass on the whole dining experience."
5,"My boyfriend and I went to Film Bar last night to see Iron Sky. Neither of us had been there before, and the decision was made quickly, so we had no idea what to expect. The bartender was incredibly nice, friendly, informative, and genuine. The prices for the bar were very reasonable, and I thought that $7 for tickets was MORE than reasonable. We were there more than an hour early, and it was so nice to just sit back on the low booths and chat. I gotta admit, I totally fell in love with this little place, and I cant wait to go back! My ONLY concern is that by the time our movie was done, there was a DJ playing music so loudly that you could hear it in the theater and you couldnt talk without shouting in the bar, so we had to go outside to converse with our friends. I would bet that the place doesnt have a DJ all the time, though."
5,"Absolutely fabulous espresso place! The owner and staff are gracious and friendly, but most importantly they get coffee! I didnt have to explain how to make an espresso macchiato -- they just made it perfectly! Ill be here every time I visit Chandler!"
5,"The place is a hole in the wall right behind the PHX car rental center. Arrived at dinner time, and had the best Mexican food! I had the #5 Machaca Plate w/rice, beans, & one of their homemade tortillas burrito style. It was just amazing, and so cheap ($5.65). The only issue I have with this place is that its very well used, and looks very dirty, I did find it a bit sticky. Maybe this is a better place for pickup.  If you want a clean restaurant, their North restaurant on Cactus Road restaurant is much cleaner."
5,"This Chipotle Rocks!   Today, I express my joy In the haiku form! Perfect fast food joint; Fresh, delicious, quick and kind. The price is right, too! Burritos galore; In a tortilla or bowl. But wait, there is more! Three steak tacos, please! Or grilled veggie fajitas? Oh sweet perfection. A simple menu, Yet so many decisions. How can you go wrong? Answer:  You cannot!   Order now, you wont regret, This Chipotle Rocks!"
5,"For some reason these self serve frozen yogurt places have popped up all over the valley and they are all very similar. What I like about this place are the choices. I usually dont have any issues, Im a mint chocolate chip man, and thats typically what I order. My girlfriend on the other hand likes to mix it up and try new flavors and toppings. This place has the largest selection of flavors and toppings of any of the self served frozen yogurt places weve been too. For those of you who are calorie conscience, as I am, they post the nutrition facts right buy the flavor so you know exactly what youre getting."
5,"Im on a community social action committee and have spent the last year planning a community-wide service day. We were each responsible to lead a team of volunteers in a different community service project and per my passion I chose the Humane Society. We arrived on Sunday afternoon with a group of 12 people at the Campus for Compassion on Dobbins Rd. Kathy - the head of volunteer services - met with us and gave us a thorough introduction. She included the history of the AZ humane society and the process and procedures by which they take-in and shelter animals. She really focused on promoting spaying and neutering pets and cited some very impressive statistics. Did you know that over 7 years un-neutered  cats can breed to reach 420,000 in numbers??!!!! and dogs 67,000??!!! thats CRAZY and so compelling.  Kathy proceeded by giving us a very educational tour of the facilities... we saw dogs, horses, cats and bunnies. It was very eye-opening. First off it shattered any stigma you have about a shelter. The animal accommodations are so impressive!! The dogs have BIG size kennels with indoor and outdoor spaces that are really spacious. I was nervous to go in and see the dogs in kennels but I really wasnt as heartbroken as I thought Id be bc they really had nice size spaces.  There are sprawling lawns in the back where animals can run and play which even include a public dog park! There are also private puppy rooms.  The cats have big crates as well and even private bedrooms where they can hang out in groups and the facilities were squeaky clean w/o any odors.  The volunteers were so nice, kind and devoted to the animals. We got to feed horses, play with cats and bunnies and put together leashes for dogs. The most encouraging thing though was that the place was busy on a sunday! buzzing with people wanting to adopt pets and several cats were actually adopted during the 2 hours we were there. It was a wonderful and meaningful experience and I encourage anyone who is looking for a pet to adopt from the Humane Society and to look into volunteering with them"
4,"Outstanding service and food , drinks are not bad. Service cant be beat."
3,Had breakfast this morning while waiting on getting my windows on my car tinted. I had the build your own omelete. I got it with chorizo bell peppers and cheddar cheese. It was pretty good and the portion size was big for the price. They had fresh squeezed orange juice too. Not the best breakfast Ive had but it was good.
4,"We had a fun, early dinner on the patio here at BoomBozz.  The advertised happy hour specials appeared to be a very good value; my fave was the soft pretzels & cheese.  I also had the wedge salad and it was excellent - they dont skimp on the blue cheese!  My son had the pepperoni pizza and even his discriminating palate was very happy.  A crisp blonde draft (for me) and ice cream (for him) polished us off and we left full & happy."
4,"This is a great place to eat and hang out with friends.  I always get the pretzel appetizer and the angry chicken sandwich.  When I am eating them, I believe there is nothing better I could be eating at the time.  I crave those items.  I also enjoy the games there- buck hunter, pool and darts. I recommend this place!"
5,"Honestly the best part of this place is the unbelievable deal you can get on pet related products. Because they are one of the primary income sources for HALO Animal Rescue, people that have pets, tend to make donations. You can almost always find pet carriers for under $10. They have dog crates for training and you dont have to shell out a fortune for them. They have fish tanks that will allow you to let little Johnny get his feet wet in the world of pet care and the associated responsibilities without breaking the bank. If you are a person that shares your life with animals, you understand the rarity of these kinds of deals! Yes they have clothes, furniture, tchatchkies, etc., but the real deals are on the pet products. As a side note, HALO recently leased the MCCAC location at 5231 North 35th Avenue (It was the previous Maricopa County run cat adoption center). So if you are looking for a companion (cat or dog), check them out and support one of the fastest growing no-kill efforts in the US. http://www.halorescue.org/index.html"
4,This place made me feel comfortable about moving to Arizona.  I just moved from L.A. and was totally worried about not having access to Asian stuff.  Of course it is not comparable to L.A. but this place has all the essentials. *Vegetables = fresh *Meat = frozen *Fish = frozen *Dried food = plenty *Bread = they bring in baked goods from Olive Bakery in L.A. *Cooking supplies = half of the store is full of them
3,"This was really 3.5 stars and Im rounding down to 3 for a few reasons...on which I will now elaborate. District could be in any Sheraton, anywhere.  In fact, it is strikingly similar to Rum Fire, the trendy restaurant in the Sheraton Waikiki where I stayed for a few days this summer before my family arrived and we stayed moved to the family place.  The flooring, the red circular lounge area, the live music on Thursday nights...it was all the same.  Heck, even the menu was the same.  The difference was that in Waikiki there was a ""Hawaiian"" slant to everything and the live music was much, much better.  (And of course the beach front setting).  I get the impression that they are trying to market themselves as a ""downtown restaurant"" more than the ""place in the Sheraton""...but to be honest, it is your quintessential trendy hotel restaurant. The bartenders were really friendly.  The wine list for a ""wine bar"" is incredibly lacking.  Nothing interesting, nothing fun.  The pricing is on par with what I would expect from a hotel.  The space is modern and trendy, something that there isnt that much of in downtown.  I love the charm of a historic home, but I also love sleek and modern lines. We selected a few small plates, or appetizers, depending on which of their menus you are looking at.  The crab cakes were good, if nothing short of predictable, and the chips and dip were surprisingly unique.  A dill dip and a French onion dip provided a nice departure from the regular spinach artichoke.  Im not sure this is a place that I would come to for dinner, and it is definitely not a place I would come to for brunch.  (The brunch menu is a typical hotel menu, with typical hotel pricing).  I think that for me District will just remain a place for drinks and small bites.   Im not going to lose my mind over this place.  Its not that great, Id say its fairly generic.  But the staff was friendly and its within walking distance of my place.  Im sure I will be back for drinks."
5,"Great Frozen Yogurt. Helpful staff, clean enviroment."
5,"I have a serious Banana Republic problem. Rewind time to about three years ago when I bought my first dress from BR. I had just gotten my first full time ""real job"" after finishing college and I needed a wardrobe to match my new position. It is now three years later and I have probably close to twenty dresses from BR. The only issue I have is they leave me pretty darn broke, so when I heard BR had a factory store I was stoked! So last weekend I dragged my husband, sister and niece down to Anthem to check this place out. It was crowded, but the prices of the items definitely make up for it. That is, when you find something worth buying. The selection of items is a little weird, and you have to fight with many other women to get into the racks with the good stuff. But I managed to find two 100% cotton dresses that are both casual and work appropriate at the same time. Priced originally at $80 with a markdown to $40 on the rack, they also had a 25% off sale on these particular items that day. So I scored two dresses originally totaled for $160 for $60. Sounds like a good deal to me. I wish they had more colors, except that would have been bad for my credit card cause I am sure I would have ended up buying them all. My husband also scored two pairs of jeans, two cotton shirts, and three pairs of boxers for under $100.  I can see myself making the 50 minute drive down here at least four times a year to see what new stuff comes in. My dress collection is going to get larger this year, I can tell you that. Also, if you sign up online for the factory store you can get coupons for extra % off your total purchase. So your super discounted items just got even more discounted."
4,"Been here a few times now so its time for the review.  Walked up to the hostess on a Saturday night and she asked if we had reservations, I said ""no"" because I didnt think this place was like that but then spending some time here it kinda makes sense, or Sens. Haha. So one time ended up getting 6 (maybe a few more but the beers were going down pretty easy that night) different items.  Each one well thought out and fun to eat.  Yes, I said fun. One was cooked by us on a hot rock, and the others made us investigate each tasty bite. Yup, the portions are small, but theyre darn good vittles I tell ya.  Oh yeah, and they have a DJ so they get a few extra hipster points."
4,"I was contacted by the manger at this location cause of my bad review, I am really for proactive owners. I really need to go back to this location to give them another try since the first time I went there it was really good. I was given a gift card to wipe out what I paid for the last meal as kinda of do over. I will be back Anthony and I will let you know how my next visit is."
5,"This my favorite Chipotle ever!!! Its so consistent and good! No hormones in the meat makes this ""fast"" food an A+ for me!!! Yum!!!"
1,"I can overcome the hipster sneer and accept that I am an uncool blemish in a world full of cut-off corduroys and patterned leggings. What I cannot and will not get over is an unapologetic staff whose epic error led to me breaking 5 years of meatless eating because of an order mishap. I ordered the red pepper tomato quiche. After 20 minutes waiting for the quiche to warm in what appeared to be a 200 degree oven, I double checked to make sure my name was on the plate at the counter. When I dug in for the first bite, a wave of nausea and panic washed over my after realizing this was a piece of the bacon spinach quiche. I returned to the counter and explained that I had ordered the vegetarian quiche, and the chic who took my order asked the chic behind the counter which one she served, because she was sure she got it right. The chic in the kitchen said she put them out in the order she got them. Then they spent some time looking around in confusion and murmuring a bit,  meanwhile all the quiche had been sold. So the counter chic simply turned to me and send, ""well we dont have anymore of that one."" Thanks. I told her I was more upset about the fact that I had just put bacon in my mouth after 5 years of no meat than there being no more quiche. She did give me my money back, but no one apologized or offered me any recompense. Im over you being cooler than me, but Im not over you having no soul."
2,"Ive lived at Mark Taylor properties for about five or six years now and I have to say, they have declined greatly in the last few years.  When I first started living at my first MT property, the front office staff took the time to get to know you, knew you by name, kept abreast of any ongoing issues and were proactive about things.   Now, they really seem to be nothing more than shills for what Mark Taylor has become, reacting to issues only when implored to do so.  Rent constantly goes up, even for those of us that have shown property loyalty years over.  Additional ""fees"" are even being added on for services that you may or may not even use -- either way you have to pay.   The only reason that I didnt give them one star is because of the maintenance staff.  They are what the front office staff used to be.  Friendly, polite and very responsive to your problems.  They, in fact, have a pretty similar opinion of the ""front office"" folks as I do.  That is pretty telling."
2,"I went here a few months ago, well I guess when they first opened, whenever that was (the fall of 2010 maybe). Anyways I am a vegan so asked about their vegan options. They said that pretty much everything was made with lard (I didnt know that people really still used that) but they said that they had a vegan burrito. I was assured that there wasnt any kind of un-vegan ingredients (such as cheese) in it. I ordered the vegan burrito with much skepticism. Once I got home and got about half way through the burrito I got a big mouth full of CHEESE!!  I was so upset because I was assured that it was vegan and did not come with cheese. But even worse,  I think that they started putting cheese on the burrito and then realized that it was supposed to be the vegan burrito with no cheese and they just kind of picked what cheese they could off and left the cheese that they couldnt easily pick off on there. I am not positive thats what happened but im pretty sure. Anyways aside from the fact that they REALLY messed up my order, the burrito was just okay. It was really pretty greasy. My fiance on the other hand seems to enjoy this place, he gave it 4 stars. He said that it is a good place for greasy mexican, and on Wednesdays you can get a huge burrito for only 5 dollars."
4,"I stayed here for two nights the first week of April 2012.  Woot. Arizona weather really is the best.  Overall, it was a nice place to stay. Purdy too. I bought a deal on Hotwire and wasnt sure what hotel I was booking until I paid, and it turned out to be this resort.  Overall, very satisfied for the price I paid.  However, I do not think I would pay $200+ a night here.  At that point, I would say its not worth it. The entrance is gorgeous and nicely updated. Trendy, modern, yet warm. Love the lit deer heads.  I want them.  It feels like a high class resort when you first go through the entrance.  Once you head to the rooms though, it does seem like an older resort.  However, our room was nicely decorated and very clean so no complaints in that area. If you are missing your pets from home, be sure to ask for a pet fish during your stay! I asked for one, well, I had to ask twice because they forgot the first time... But soon I had a goldfish in my room which I named Basil.  (Due to me becoming inebriated on one too many cucumber basil martinis... Dont judge) As for the room/parking, its very easy to park extremely close to the entrance to the rooms which we liked.  It was easy to navigate in and out as the resort is fairly small.  The room itself, ours faced the parking area, which we didnt really care either way about.  It was close to the pool so that was good enough for us.  However, I will say the bed sucked.  When my husband turned, I too turned and bounced along with him.  They badly need to upgrade to better beds. While not uncomfortable per se, I dont enjoy feeling every teeny movement of my partners. They had nice toiletries- C.O Bigelow.  I enjoyed those little aspects. For an hour every evening they had free wine happy hour, which we did check out one of the evenings.  Hey, no one complains about Free Wine!!!  Nothing special, but it did the trick. Hotel Bar: Had some kick ass cocktails.  Plenty of strength and tasty concoctions. Biggest Bummer?  The pool area.  Dont get me wrong, its pretty. First appearances are good.  There is plenty of shade from large palms and such and theres an area for kiddies with sand.  However, there is not enough chairs for the amount of guests.  And the guests that are there put towels on all the chairs even if they arent around, which is not cool.  Suggestion to hotel:  Perhaps walk around every hour and remove towels if no ones been sitting there for awhile?  Its not fair for a select few to have a chair all day, while others are unable to lay by the pool at all.  And while there is plenty of shade, for me that was another downfall.  Almost too much shade.  It was hard to find areas to sun in compared to those covered by shade.  It made me majorly pissy.  Sun is why I came to AZ. Overall, a great place close to downtown Scottsdale and a walk away from the mall. Perfect for those who want to spend time near the action.  If you can get a good deal here, its worth the stay. Plus, they have a free shuttle if you want to go somewhere a few  miles from of the place.  (so you can drink and have a driver)"
1,"Not recommended if youre not white. For me, its the third time somebody threw out racial slurs at my group. I am beginning to think the place is for rednecks and the like. D&B bowling lanes are better."
1,My daughter and I went in for pedicures and gel sets... was incredibly surprised to hear the total was $120. even with a coupon!!! When I got home I noticed that my pedicure wasnt the best... I really dont mind paying top dollar for top dollar services but even with a coupon it wasnt worth it. Wont be back...
1,"I think chef Silvana Esparza first located the restaurant here on CALLE DIECISEIS (she renamed the street all by herself, apparently) to take advantage of cheap rent.  There was no way she was going to locate her Scottsdalish restaurant actually in Scottsdale.  So, people from the wealthier areas - and some First Friday urban hipsters whose parents foot their bills - make the trek down to CALLE DIECISEIS to partake in everything Barrio Cafe.  And they think its cool that they are going there, past the check cashing places, the people waiting at the bus stops and the ""rawness"" of this part of central Phoenix. And what is everything ""Barrio Cafe""???? Pretentious service. LOUD dining room. NO parking. Fusion food that is about 10 years past its prime. High prices. Lets talk a little about the last item on the list. Besides using vulgar language in her YouTube videos for pseudo social activism, Esparza seems to have forgotten her own humble upbringings.  Its ironic that the very people who live on and around CALLE DIECISEIS cannot afford to eat in her restaurant.  The Mexican immigrants and their sons and daughters who do the cooking, the cleaning, the landscaping and all that for Phoenix are not welcome at the Barrio Cafe.  I know that this is not a taco truck, but there is some overwhelming irony here that you locate your restaurant in a working class area and supposedly have sympathy for the plight of the downtrodden and the neighbors cant even eat  at your restaurant.  I guess thats capitalism.  Like that new car, by the way."
5,This location is great and there grooming service is good as well.
1,"I called The Town Dump to ask if I could come in this week and interview them for an English paper about a small local business, and the owner was just incredibly rude. She didnt even let me finish telling her it would take five minutes of her time, preferring to interject and tell me to go somewhere else. When I explained that Ive heard wonderful things about their business from friends, and that that sparked my interest, she said, ""Well, go somewhere else."" Ive never even been inside, and I sure as hell wont go now. Maybe its just me, but I dont like shopkeepers who snarl at their customers."
1,"So, theres no negative stars, too bad. Tried ordering take out before actually eating there to try it - good thing, you couldnt pay me to eat here. The only thing about the Colossal Cobb salad I ordered was the price. $10 and change for lettuce just enough to cover the bottom of the styrofoam with a sprinkle of toppings. Whered they get their chef, Chilis? What a disappointment. All the reviews say  a lot of food ...for who, an infant? I had also ordered a couple of carmelized cookies as well. Didnt know deep fried, greasy discs of oatmeal harder than concrete were called cookies. Good grief, the bakery wasnt even good! Had to spit those things out before they took out a filling.  The only good thing about Chandler Chompies is Jasons Deli right next door."
5,"A great place for midday healthy food, thin crust good pizza ( try wild mushroom & arugula), salads are great too & the best part that serve pretty acceptable nice wines. It is not an average American food eatery, it is definitely for those who are looking for healthy low calorie lunch."
4,This was my first time here. It was a nice experience.. And I found that I really like Indian food ! Good stuff !
4,"LOVE this place! I meet my husband here for lunch as often as I can. It is a bit pricey for being a fast food place but the food is so good. I always get the pita pizza and the pasta salad. Excellent place to eat. The decor is funky but the staff is usually really nice and again, the food is great!"
4,"This is a really good Starbucks location. Unlike a lot of the newer locations that have retro plastic chairs that look much more stylish than functional, it has lots of comfy upholstered chairs, plenty of plugs for web surfers, and a decently-sized outdoor seating area. The staff is really friendly and efficient as well. There is also a drive-through."
3,"decent.  the potstickers were kind of good.  I didnt really know what to expect.  it met my expectation.  the lychee pork was good and deserved the second helping.  the selection was impressive.  and the stuffed mushrooms had an interesting stuffing.  spam, was it?  some sort of sausage or other processed meat that made it quite a delightful surprise."
5,"Amanda at Butterfly Petals did the flowers for my wedding. I didnt want to spend  a lot on them and shaved it down to only needing my bouquet, three boutonnieres and two corsages. I told her what I liked and didnt and my budget. She created a bunch of options for me based on my specifics so I had a  number of choices. She also did all of this via email. which I give her total kudos for.  On the day of my wedding, there was a fabulous bouquet waiting for me as well as perfect corsages and boutonnieres for my groom and our parents. Amanda waited for me, even though I was terribly late, to make sure I was happy with her creations which really gave a personal touch. Butterfly Petals is creative and affordable. I love my bouquet so much that I ended up keeping it and I am having it preserved!"
5,"Who dosent like Cosco, I love this place. The pizza is cheap and good."
3,Its the kinda place where youre certain the employees dont spit in your food. Best Taco Bell Ive been to.
4,"I found this place when we needed a place to meet for a business lunch.  I had the smoked BBQ chicken which was good but that seems to be all I get when I go.  Ive tried some of the other dishes but havent really liked them.  My wife loves the fried pickles which Im not a fan of.  The portions are huge but there does not seem to be anything special I can remember besides really large portions.  I suppose the biscuits topped with sugar smothered in honey butter are good but I also want to live to be at least 50 and they are not worth dying for.  As unimpressed as I am with the food, the service is very good.  Ive been there a few times now and have always been pleased with they way they treat us.  Everything from the speed and attentiveness has been good."
5,"I work across the street and love me some Hava Java. The morning crew is very friendly, and the coffee is great. I am a big fan of the Swiss chocolate blend, (or any of the flavored blends for that matter!) they are really flavorful without tasting at all artificial. I buy Hava Java beans and brew them at home, but when I stop in for a quick cup of coffee I always have a good experience."
2,"I feel bad giving this 2 stars but Im basing it on other burger joints in the area. I recently Had a fab experience at Zinburger so this is why they are only getting 2 stars. Sat at the bar and ordered the cowboy Burger and adult choc milkshake ($14) pretty pricey and tasted just like a reg choc shake?? The burger bun on the bottom was extremely mushy and was not eaten. Overall I just have had better. All the burgers are $16, luckily we said ""happy birthday"" which is a deal thru today May 4th 3-6 PM that makes one burger free. Prob wont go back."
1,"False ads, do not stay there. Unless you dont mind a dirty, smelly, overrated hotel. The sheets and towels that were supposed to be white were gray. The place is run down and poorly serviced. The front lobby is clean but once you head up to your room you quickly find out that the place is run down and not being taken care of. I stayed on the fifth floor ""cabana suites"" and as soon as my elevator opened up on the fifth floor, I knew right away I stayed at the wrong place. The ""suites"" were nothing more than a room with a tiny bit of extra elbow space that are on the rooftop area with a pool in the front of the room. The pool was NASTY! (see pictures I uploaded) It was green and looked disgusting and when I arrived to take a look, it had an ""out of order"" sign placed at the entrance. This place was embarrassing! I had told my brothers to book there with me because we thought it was going to be a great hotel based on their website but we were very disappointed again!"
5,"A hole in the wall in South Phoenix....  I order: The ""Betty Boop"" - a plate with 1 waffle and 1 fried chicken breast.  Add a huge mason jar of the sweetest & reddest Koolaid (or Sweet Tea - depending on my mood) and a side of grits drowning in melted butter and Im a happy girl. Their Red Velvet Cake is also amazing.  I know fried chicken and waffles seem like an odd combination but its really interesting and satisfying - with the syrup and hot sauce for the chicken.... Yum Yum.   Its one of my familys favorites!!!   TRY IT!!!!"
4,Back in high school I used to work in metrocenter and this place still has the best lemonade I have ever had. I have not eaten the food from here so I have no idea on the quality.
5,"They have the nicest staff and the Dr. is always open when examining our dog! We have boarded her there as well and the staff is so kind, and when our dog gets there she cant wait to run up and play with the staff!"
4,"I first saw this place while I was on light rail going to basket ball game. The stop is nearby and it makes it easy to get to. The food here is very good! Everything I get here tastes home made and offers just the right amount of spice. Their salsas are very delicious! I always get the enchiladas or the bean burritos served enchilada style. Both the red and green sauce are very tasty. The service is always very fast and helpful. We came here late one night and were one of the only people left, but the waitress never hurried us and was very courteous."
5,"This place literally just opened.  I didnt really know what to expect, but when I walked in the doors I was immediately greeted by Nick, and he was very nice and down to earth.  This is a shop for people who like to garden/grow plants hydroponically or in the ground. They have all kinds of gardening supplies and Nick said they will be receiving their seed shipment from Seeds of Change any day now.  I will definitely be back, as my green thumb (or lack thereof) has been sparked:)  P.S. I was informed that the in the next issue of the New Times, Grotown will have an add to clip out and bring in to save 20% !!Yay plants:)"
4,"I recently went to my first First Friday (and my first trip to downtown Phoenix). After a few hours at the Phoenix Art Museum, friends and I hopped on the light rail and tried a new restaurant. Enter The Breadfruit. Easy to find (sign on the street corner) on a charming and quiet little street sits The Breadfruit with a hostess standing out front greeting guests. You can see the very intimate seating area from the street and it was packed (a good thing for 8:30pm on a Friday night). We sat and waited outside at the cute little tables (way too hot to eat a full meal outside). We were offered menus to peruse while we waited about 10 minutes for a table. Inside, we ordered two mixed drinks (a mojito vanilla for me). They were strong and very good. The mojito was very minty and refreshing and my mojito-loving friend said he should have ordered a mojito. (Read: Get a mojito.) The Food: We split a tilapia patty (very spicy!) for an appetizer. (Patties are Jamaican empanadas.)  I had the coconut curried tofu with rice and peas, ripe plantains, and veggies. This is the one of the best tofu dishes I have ever had. My only complaint is that Breadfruit needs to have more plantains per plate. They are so good! One friend had the curried chicken and dumpling with a green banana, veggies, plantains, and a side order of rice and peas. Although he didnt like the whole wheat dumpling, he loved the curry sauce and the green banana. He called the sauce ""delectable.""  Overall, this is a great place. Small, but great. The drinks are strong, the food is great, and the serve is prompt. Our only regrets are 1) not enough plantains and 2) we should have gotten dessert."
4,"I really like Maizies, but unfortunately will not get to go as often anymore. I hate to report that after our last visit, my husband received a bad bout of food poisoning. It was, in fact, his first time puking in approximately 10 years. It was not pleasant for him and it was not pleasant for me. For that reason, I guess Im going to have to drop one star from my previous review.  The thing is, I really love Maizies. I love their menu and I love their atmosphere. Unfortunately, the portobello sandwich...or maybe it was the cottage cheese...just doesnt love my husband and that means I dont get to visit quite as often.  :("
4,"The Saguro is a bright, happy place in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale and I, for one, am a big fan of bright, happy places (people, too but thats a story for another time.) It is set up more like an apartment and less like a hotel with lots of buildings scattered about, all surrounding a pool. (There is actually more than one pool to make this happen.) It definitely has more of a party vibe than some hotels, which is just fine by me. I can imagine during the summa, summa, summertime these pools are hopping.  And, even though the feel of the place is fun, the staff of the place is nothing less than professional. Every single person I interacted with was beyond kind, helpful, and happy. Whether you need a hotel room for a night or a full trip, a place to hang out poolside, a happy hour cocktail, a casual meeting place, or breakfast or lunch I think The Saguaro just might have you covered. And all with a smile.  Whats not to like about that?"
3,"I appreciate any airport restaurant that doesnt feel over-crowded or cramped.  We usually have to stop in Phoenix for our layover going to and from California from Texas, so I think this might be our new dinner spot.  Its big, plenty of seating, and clean. I love the affordable menu options...especially for being in an airport.  My husband and I both got the taco plates (mine steak and his fish) which come with two soft corn tortilla tacos, black beans, and rice.  The tacos were tasty but the rice and beans were flavorless and the rice seemed a bit undercooked.  After I drenched everything with hot sauce I was able to finish my meal. Although I love the cheap food options (around $6 for a taco or burrito meal), the drinks were super expensive.  Our Bloody Mary was $11!  My mango fresca (non-alcoholic) was about $4. The service was good and we dont really have any complaints.  This is a good option for someone looking for something not too greasy or heavy."
5,Ive been going here for 10 years. My relationship began when I needed a bunch of clothes tailored for my first trip to Europe. I needed everything quickly and was very specific. She got everything done in time for my trip.  Over the years Ive brought dozens of clothes. Shes done everything from changing a dress into a top to adding bra pads to a cocktail dress. Shes hemmed and taken in. Shes shortened straps and helped me change out fabric in clothing to create a completely different look. I can communicate anything I want and shell have it done exactly the way I envisioned it. Weve been able to change things so much we sometimes recreate new looks.  Her prices are a little high but well worth the quality. Every single person Ive recommended has been extremely pleased with her work.
5,"This is the location I frequent most (it helps it is less than a mile from my home).  I have been to a U.S. Egg (this and other locations) more than a dozen times (or two) since moving to AZ in 2010. I love breakfast food and the ""specialty"" won me over instantly; PROTEIN PANCAKES! As the timeless Tina Turner once said, ""Simply the Best!"". That describes these pancakes perfectly.  Before I go on and on about the pancakes (because I have been known to do so) some background information about atmosphere, staff etc.  This location is in a nondescript one story building in front of the offices at Mill Towne Center (or is it Mill Town Centre?). Nothing fancy, but I dont need a ""Jacket Required"" sort of feel to a place to enjoy my breakfast.  The staff is fantastic; hosts/hostesses, waitresses, busboys. I have never had anyone employed here be anything but 100% professional and attentive. To speak to something others have mentioned about getting the check early (while they are still eating); as long as you continue to be my waitress (i.e. refills, requests for jelly, etc.) I dont care if you bring the bill with the food. If I decide I want something else, I doubt any of the folks here would have a problem reprinting a corrected bill. Now on to the food!!  The protein pancakes are filled with blueberries, granola, cinnamon and silvered almonds. The ingredients arent something exotic, but they are perfectly balanced in the mix (not too much or too little of any of them). The thing about any food item you like at a restaurant, it becomes a favorite because they are able to duplicate it time after time. I have had this item many times (more than any other item), and they are always spot on (knock on wood) :).  All the other dishes I have had (always breakfast, havent tried lunch yet) were some combination of eggs and protein, and the eggs are always perfectly cooked to my specification (over medium), and the meat always juicy.  I promise to write another review as soon as I dont get the protein pancakes (which will be when they decide to remove them from the menu - NEVER). :) Oh, or if I actually go in later than normal and feel like lunch over breakfast (not good odds :O)."
1,"What.  The.   Heck. ??    Be prepared for sticker shock!  I walked in, through the store, and made a hasty straight line back to exit.  And over and across the road to Crate & Barrel  - Ahhhhhh - much better!  Whew!"
1,"Read al lthe hype, so decided to give Cyclo a try.  What a disappointment!  Portions were small and overpriced, owner thinks shes the next best thing to sliced bread.  She needs to go back to Vietnam to remember how real Vietnamese food is prepared. Give this place a miss."
5,"This place is the truth. It is easily one of the absolute best spots in Phoenix for Sonoran style Mexican cuisine. The chile colorado is so good, it made me try to slap my mama. The red sauce with the chips is actually brewed in the sixth level of hell. Awesome. Fridays feature $1.99 margaritas before 7 p.m. Swing by, start with the cheese crisp, grab any combo and revel in the gluttony."
5,"Do Taco Jedis work at Senor Taco?  Yes. Yes they do. Is the force of making killer fast Mexican food strong with these Jedis?  Oh hell yeah! Try the shredded beef tacos in the hard shells. When they ask you if you want hot sauce, say si and drizzle it mightily onto the tacos. Piled cheese, beef, lettuce, tomatoes all stuffed into an authentic-style taco shell - it doesnt get any better than this. Just make sure you put a helmet on because its crazy good. If you like spicy, no-nonsense burritos, go with the Carne Asada Burrito (Red Chile). If you like the whole meal, go with the Carne Asada or Pollo Asado burrito combo plates. The plate comes with flour tortillas, beans and rice, guacamole and salsa fresca. You make your own burritos. This is just good eatin. Take it home, crack open a good Hefeweizen, and you are golden. And lastly, from the sage words of my wife: ""The shrimp tacos and burritos are certified gourmet meals!"" Do I stutter? Nope. While Senor Taco is technically fast food it does take some time to prepare. If you do drive-thru dont get all road ragey if it takes longer than it does at Taco Bell. There is a price to pay to make good food and that price is TIME. This is not a worldwide chain that spends more on advertising and earning your business by putting cute little dogs on plastic mugs. Senor Taco is not that type of place. A little wait is very much worth it. I realize that appearance of the location irks some reviewers. Yes, it is in a strip mall. Yes it is 100-150 feet away from a gas station slash AM/PM mini market. I get that. But this is not Sanctuary. This is not Kai. This is not Deseo. When one reviewer (and I use the word reviewer loosely here) hilariously claims to have walked in, used his Superman vision to supposedly spot a family of offending microbes and (without trying the food) proceeded to sprint out because he was frightened of all the imagined cooties ... well... I just have to laugh. Thats not a review, its a drive-by, and reviewers like this are probably happier with Hometown Buffet or Lubys Cafeteria. And thats too bad because this is excellent fast food. Ive eaten here maybe 15-20 times and my wife has ordered the fish taco plate a number of times and neither of us has ever gotten sick. The people at Senor Taco are nice, the food pleasantly surprises and your expectation of fast Mexican food will be forever changed for the better. I cant recommend highly enough."
2,"I had dinner at the Thai Rama two days ago. It wasnt an awful dining experience, but Im not sure I would go here again.  My friend and I ordered the egg rolls (sorry, I dont remember the Thai name), and they were okay. Two pieces, small (but the price was $2, so what did I expect?), and an average filling - something I would expect from frozen egg rolls. Were both vegetarians and were happy to see a vegetarian section in the menu, but were slightly disappointed with the options. Three of the items included oyster sauce, and the other three were either vegetarian fried rice or red/green curry vegetables. I ordered the green curry vegetables (medium hot), and my friend ordered the red curry vegetables (mild - and she stressed MILD). We waited 20 minutes for our dinner to arrive. I didnt mind my dish - it was waaaaay spicier than medium, but I dont mind a little heat. The sauce was very runny, and the vegetables were soggy and looked they had been sitting in the sauce for quite a while. My friend didnt like her dish at all, mostly because it was quite spicy for being a mild dish. We spent $25 total, and Im not sure it was worth it. The service was slow, but the waitresses were very friendly. Overall, I would probably not recommend this restaurant to a friend."
5,"Best Italian sub Ive had. Very nice owners. Just be aware theres no place to sit, so youll have to get it to go."
4,"We went here because it was the only decent place we could find open after the Suns game. Fresh fish sandwich was delicious, as well as the shoestring fries. Great service, nice vibe, Id go back."
4,"At the recommendation of a friend, I met a client here for lunch.  My client was arriving from out of town and this joint is very conveniently located near the airport.  I guess once upon a time, it was an actual stockyard.  Now, its an old school restaurant that has a lot of character. After browsing the menu, I opted for a BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich & Fries, $10.  To wash it down, I ordered Iced Tea. The Pork Sandwich was awesome, very tasty and a large portion.  You will get full.  The Fries were tasty as well. My client was impressed with the restaurant and put it on his ""best place near the airport to have a lunch meeting"" list....+++ The service was great and we were able to have a good lunch meeting that left us both satisfied. Return Factor - 100%"
3,"Marcellas does have its downside, but today Im in a good mood and I am recommending you stop in for the following three reasons: 1.) They bring absolutely delicious bread (including olive oil) to your table almost immediately. I love this and I love their bread. 2.) You can sit on a ""patio"" inside the mall and have the most amazing people-watching experience. Fashion Square shoppers can be quite entertaining. 3.) The Amalfi Spritzer might just be my favorite cocktail of all time. Vodka + passion fruit + basil = HEAVEN. Plus, they use those cute little cylinder-shaped ice cubes that somehow make the drink even better."
5,Mastros serves up the best steak in Scottsdale.  They also offer delicious seafood and excellent side dishes.  Prices are steep. After 10pm this place becomes a pick up joint for gold digging women seeking sugar daddys.
4,"I had no idea they were open for lunch! Perfect since the boy and I were down town during lunch the other day.  We stopped in around 2:30 inthe afternoon. No Wait! I couldnt even believe it. I hadnt eaten there since I was a little girl, but it was just as good as I remember. We got a couple beers and split the Margarita Pizza. It was sooo yummy! Perfectly crispy on the edges and lots of flavor. The service was a tini bit slow, but no big deal, we loved it.  If you want great pizza and dont want to wait the normal 3 hours during dinner, you should hit up Pizzaria Bianco while the sun is still up, less wait time if at all.  Enjoy!!"
3,"I just dont think Im much of a brewery gal. Granted, the beer here blows Four Peaks out of the water, but Id much rather have a nice cocktail than chew though a specialty brew. But if beer is your poison of choice, theyve got just about everything. The happy hour is kind of weak here though, with like a buck off all drafts. Thoroughly meh. You can peruse the coolers and grab a cold one or choose from 20+ drafts they have on the menu. No Bud Light here though. Sorry frat chumps. They used to have a ton of wine here as well (like, ages ago) but it has since been narrowed down to just four choices, none of which were calling my name this last go round. Their Orange Blossom wheat beer was a bit like drinking an orange creamsicle in beer form. Almost like a cider with floral notes, a light finish and a super creamy mouthfeel. (Oh yeah, bitches. I just went there.) The perfect beer for the novice drinker to enjoy. Their IPA was also pretty decent, but was more bitter than I care for, although it stayed far away from feeling like I was drinking a bottle of grassy perfume. Solid. I thought they had deals on happy hour food (again, like a buck off) but last time I went it was no dice. At least the foods reasonably priced. Tasty rueben, craptastic hummus, crispy quesadilla.  The acoustics in this place are kind of shitty, so go on an off time when it wont be packed, or run the risk of smiling and nodding amicably while hearing every other snippet of convo. The high top tables are also really uncomfortable for shorties like me to sit at, but cest la vie. My biggest peeve about this place is the gigando assy television against the wall. For a place this small, a big ass mofo tv is just  not the way to go."
4,"This Mexican food is very simple, slightly bland, but fairly fresh. The chicken is chopped up into tofu-looking squares. But I was satisfied with the food, which was fairly healthy Mexican food as Mexican food goes. The staff is quite polite. I met some cool people hanging out there while I sat outside."
5,"Always a healthy, fresh meal. One of my favorites is the hummus and grilled chicken appetizer(which is gynormous) and I have them add in some tabbouleh, then cucumbers on the side. Perfection. All the pitas, and the seasonal specials are always super good. Wine is also inexpensive if the mood strikes. Otherwise, great casual lunch and dinner spot that is extremely reasonable in price for the quality of food you are getting. There is something for everyone here, veggies, kids, etc. If I ever moved from AZ, this is the first place I would come visit upon my return. Parking can get hairy at the Arcadia location, and one time someone actually backed into my car when I was legally parked along a curb but that is hardly Pita Jungles fault. The douche didnt even leave a note - but I digress and karma is real and nothing would keep me from coming back to Pita!"
4,"I was only able to play the front 9; my wrist was hurting too much to finish, which is a big deal because I live in IL, and was returning from LA and stopped here specifically to play the TPC. Oh well. I was a single, and got paired with another. The course was pretty open, but we took our time and enjoyed the round. The front nine, although rarely shown on TV, is quite nice. Definitely challenging enough, and I didnt even play the back tees. It was fairly easy to get on, the bar had pretty good food for a clubhouse, and the staff were very helpful. Definitely recommend the TPC."
3,"Even though I am officially in my 30s, I look like Im still in college, which made me feel slightly less uncomfortable when I walked into The Clubhouse. Yes, it is near ASU, and yes, it is an all-age venue, so I should have expected that the club would be filled with 18-20 somethings. But just because I look 21, doesnt mean that my internal reality made me feel a little out-of-place. But, I was like, whateva! It is somewhat of a dive bar trying to be a club but failing miserably. Like a nerd trying to be punk or a cheerleader trying to be emo -- it somehow didnt work for me. It felt like I was in someones basement turned rockers haven. Black walls, haphazard decor, and one sole stinky quasi-couch that looked like it had been salvaged from some dump.  The stage was at the front of the club, and the bar in the middle dissected the under-21 crowd from the over-21 boozers. Unfortunately, if you wanted to drink, you had to stay on the over-21 side of the bar. That sucked because you barely had a view of the stage. WTF?!  Shouldnt the paying lushes get a better view than the youngsters who only paid to get in the club? Stupid. I have to say, though, the sound system was a helluva lot better than some of the other small music venues Ive been to.  Thats a plus.   Finally, this last annoyance will definitely show my age, but having to stand the entire time I was there was horrible. My feet hurt, dammit! And, I just wanted to sit down! But, Ill suck it up the next time because there are some great bands that play here, and for me, great music can make any situation better."
5,"Excellent service!!!! I had to find a spa different from lavenders after they got rid of yet another excellent staff member, so I tried this place! I was SO HAPPY!! clean, pleasant, warm, comforting. The manager is actually on site and aware of the things going on in their spa! The staff is friendly and efficient!  Lavenders day spa can learn from this place. Send the owner from lavenders to sanity and TAKE NOTES.  I HIGHLY recommend it here!!!!!! Go and enjoy!!!"
4,"If you want a good neighborhood bar, Ernies is exactly that. This is the place I go when Im not looking to get all dolled up but I still want to go out. There is nothing unique about it, it is just a bar that is good at being a bar. It also has all of the best activities for drinking.  I LOVE shuffleboard and a dive-bar is not a dive-bar without it. Great thing about theirs is it is in the patio area so you can smoke while playing (I smoke when I drink, yes filthy, disgusting habit Im aware) ...sometimes they charge like five bucks for the pucks other times not, depends on the bartender I think.  They also have two pool tables, and I think golden tee.  Their is a room that has karaoke. I am a singer and enjoy karaoke from time to time, the night I participated there were some amazing singers and it was really fun to listen to everyone. The karaoke DJ. has a really good selection of songs, lots to choose from you will probably find what you are looking for.  I tend to get hit on every time Im there which I guess is an ego boost but I would prefer to be left alone at a place like this. Im usually in the mood to do my own thing with my own friends at a place like this and dont feel like making new friends but thats just me.  Not sure about their drink selection, I always just get Michelob Ultra (lame I know) or cranberry/vodka...the mixed drinks are strong, their well is gross though but to be expected.  Always a good laid back time at Ernies. They can count on me as a regular."
5,"Disclaimer: Like many of you, I am a sucker for charming little homes that have been re-purposed into restaurants. I am certain that this colored my opinion of Cibo. That being said, I absolutely love having lunch here the other day. I unknowingly arrived at 2:05 (5 minutes after they close between lunch and dinner) but was served anyway. I had the salscicia sandwich and a side of fruit. The sandwich was excellent, served on perfectly crisp, chewy saltimbocca bread. The sausage was flavorful and was complimented by roasted red peppers and onions. All this was finished off with a great quality mozzarella cheese. Really, really delicious. I should also say that the atmosphere here was friendly and  comfortable, though a bit small. This would be a great place to hang out if you lived nearby."
3,"Better than rubios or filabertos by a long shot open late and has a drive through. When i walked in it was packed and i noticed how cheap the beer and Margaritas were. Wait... I dont remember having ever seen a hole-in-the wall Mexican spot serving booze before (wonder if they sell it via drive through). The menu is like a Jewish Torah being that it has a 100,000 words and is very hard to read. The tacos and burritos also come w/ a side of toquitos that is buried under chiuaua cheese and guacamole. Shrimp and fish tacos are made on tortillas are made in house. Food is super cheap and tasty. Its too bad that all their locations are in the middle of nowhere."
5,Love this place.  Friendly staff. Always a treat to see whats cooking on the weekend. I dont mind standing in line to order. Great way to meet new friends and talk to old ones. Ask Kiersten about the cortadito.
4,"-Biggest Joanns store -Great fabric selection -Clean store, good layout (different from other Joann stores) -Convenient location (parking is not too bad). -Employees are friendly. -Restrooms are blah and smell."
4,"Over the last 3 years weve lived in the area, this place has changed 4 times.  First Uncle Bears, then Tio Osos, then Thirsty Cactus (or Thirsty Cantina, whatever, it sucked), and now its TCs Pub & Grub.  The menu is typical bar food, including burgers, sandwiches, pizza, wings as well as some taco and quesadilla selections (which I always appreciate a good quesadilla so I will have to try it next time).  The restaurant section (which was always dead before) has now been opened up and TVs added so the whole place is more of a bar feel (thumbs up).  The place was packed for Thursday night football (Cardinals game!), but still got a good table close to a TV.   Server (who admitted multiple times he was brand new) was very friendly but had to keep asking other servers for clarification on menu, etc.  Still, nice enough and very attentive. We ordered wings (""medium"" but they were spicy!) and their ""ugly"" crust pizza with mushrooms and olives.  The wings, very good, I would get them again.  Pizza, I wouldnt order it again if someone paid me.  The ""ugly"" crust basically is a thick hand tossed crust - too much crust (and half of it was burned) and very skimpy on the toppings.  It was pretty horrible honestly.  The actual toppings (although sparse) were very tasty... good cheese and fresh mushrooms and olives, so I would order pizza here again IF they have a thinner crust option.  Otherwise, if you are coming here to carb load and really need your bread fix, by all means, order the pizza.  I personally prefer a thinner NY style crust. All in all I would come here again based on the good wings and service, and Im looking forward to trying their other menu options.  p.s. text TCSPUB to 411247 and theyll send you a text coupon for a 50 cent draft. Score! (Im a sucker for a deal)  Cheers!"
3,"was super duper busy when i ordered. but then again, they were a fast food place, and i waited for my To Go order for 25 minutes. They have 5 or 6 people inside their kitchen. And a lot were waiting for their food cos there were some mixed up. Will go back though cos I know those things happen when its a busy day. The food was bomb specially the hotdog!"
4,"Considering this is the only gym Ive ever been in, its great! They have updated equipment and lots of them. I usually go during one of the busy times and can always get on a machine, or do the things I want to. Plus they have classes which are good. And every time me & my boyfriend walk in & out of the Y, a nice gal at the food counter greets us and says goodbye. We still never order anything, though... They lose a star though because I HATE WORKING OUT!  Sigh..."
5,So perfect. The atmosphere is just spot on. I love going whether its just to grab coffee and leave or if I am there studying or just want to chill. I love their Apple Harvest (?) salad. So delicious and beautifully prepared. Baristas are always very nice (especially Brianna!). Cant wait to hopefully become a regular and attend some of the live music events they put on every week!!
5,"If you want a deal for your buck, this is the place to go! Youll find Dewalt, Makita, Oster, Cuisinart, Farberware, Keurig, and many other banded items for a fraction of the original retail price. Yes, some items will be out the package, missing a manual, or may have a scratch or a dent but I rather pay a fraction of the price versus paying full retail at a department store. I rather save money and get a ridiculous deal for the same exact item I would have paid 10X more at a well organized and clean shop. From what I know this store has been open for nearly ten years; the owners are one of the nicest people Ive met; they even offer free delivery with the furniture or any other large item you purchase. Stop by!! Youll get a kick from just walking down the unorganized, messy aisles; but once you get to the register to pay- youll be happy!! ""Get more for less!"""
1,"Its a good concept if the owners / mismanagement had bothered to keep a trendy or classy atmosphere. As it is save your money get fast food - McDonalds has less grease. We had to ask for plates for the appetizer platter (it is meant to be shared) so the sever handed my daughter 4 paper plates.  My salad wasnt a salad it was a paper plate of mixed greens - really no tomatoes, nothing on it or in it other than lettuce and she threw a packet of Newmans Dressing on the table just like the ones you get at Burger King or McDonalds. My steak - it was OK - I asked for medium and got medium well and that was the best part of it. The steak is served on a paper plate and when I asked about utensils I was directed to go get my own from around the corner - yup plastic ware for a steak on a paper plate. My daughter had a burger and it was so greasy the bun turned soggy brown part way through then fell completely apart. Service? Well lets just pretend this place is 100% do it yourself then it would be OK. The waitress walked away before my daughter finished her order. Never came back and asked how things were, nothing. Really if we were the kind to dine & dash it wouldnt have been a problem because she wouldnt have known we were gone. My daughter actually had to go find the server and ask for the bill!!!! What kills me is the employees exude an I dont care attitude which is also obvious in their actions (or lack of actions) and the message I got was the owner / mis-management has accepted this lazy unfriendly service because its obvious by how poorly the place is run that its OK with them. It could be great but they would need to make a lot of changes - job 1 fire everyone & start over. If I could have given them 1/2 a star I would have - we wont be going back."
5,"Yes, it is probably as good as it gets for a SANDWICH place. Very tasty. All 3 of us liked our different sandwiches. I also ordered pasta salad but it really was not any good, but it does not matter as i did not come there for a pasta salad. Real good besides that."
5,"The BEST of the BEST! I agree with Daren C.  Killer Burgers, Steaks, Prime Rib and of course ribs. Food melts in your mouth.  Make this your next restaurant stop.  You will not be disappointed."
5,"Seriously soo good! Drove 60miles to come here about 5 times in the 3 months that I lived in AZ.  I came here because of the triple D episode and it was soo worth it! Burgers, fries, onion rings, sweet potatoe fries and pizza are ALL GOOD!  and check out their bathrooms.. its pretty cool too.  Tried Joes Real BBQ, which is their first restaurant but it was just OK.  Joes Farm grill is def. one of my fav places.."
2,"I cook better pasta than them, and I am not much of a cook. The pasta I had (I believe it was a marinara dish with penne pasta) was awfully bland. Sauce didnt mix well with the pasta either. The texture of the pasta was funky, hanging out on its own. If I wanted bland pasta I would buy a can of Presto and penne pasta, boil them together and add some water :p The server was attentive enough to notice and brought me more sauce. I did like the service and how they had the giant white piece of paper and crayons on the table so I could doodle while I waited. The waitress was very attentive and friendly. Appetizer: calamari was yummy. I just wish they could kick it up a notch on the pasta with richer sauces, seasoning, texture, more tomato/meat/cheese and really blending it with their pasta.   But I guess that would raise costs/prices huh. :/"
4,"Huge fan of this bistro. Everyday or two there is a new exotic meat that you must try. The staff is super awesome and Brant is my go to guy. I highly recommend sangria sundays, the wagyu and veggie burger are my absolute favorites. Not to mention, the sweet potato fries and Purple Haze beer.  If you like sliders, this is the best place to go in scottsdale."
2,"Boring.  Uninspired.  Generally sauce-less, which means the meat courses are plain and dry.  The salmon tastes like styrofoam.  The filet is flavorful but they use low quality cuts.  The veggies are simply steamed.  No doubt the options are healthy, but at the sacrifice of flavor.  When I pay this much to eat out, I want to taste it and enjoy it."
5,"I absolutely LOVE Club SAR! I joined back in 2010 (I think...). At first, I just went there with my ex (who lived in So Cal and had been boxing) because I have always loved the sport of boxing and wanted to get into it myself (maybe even join the boxing team).  Sadly, I exceeded the age limit to join the boxing team, by a few years...  :-( But, at least I could still learn and get fit.  :-) We just walked up to the entrance and just took one quick look around and it seemed crowded and small so we were not impressed. So, we left. I found out this used to be just a boxing gym before but eventually they added other classes and equipment for others to enjoy.  Glad I went back later on my own and found out how affordable it was! I checked and tried a few other Fitness centers and gyms nearby but, when I decided to actually try one of Club SARs boxing classes, I was hooked! For a mere $3  (a day) drop-by fee, I was able to get one of the best workouts I ever had. I joined after I found out it only cost $75 for the whole YEAR which includes ALL the classes I can take (Boxing, boxing conditioning, Yoga, spin class, kickboxing, weight training, MMA... Yes! MMA too, which I personally love.  :-) ). Jonathan & Carlos are great and so is Tom. Theyre funny, friendly, and they actually remember you after only a few classes.  The pricing has gone up this year but it is still by far, the BEST possible deal you can find anywhere in the Valley.  Fees    YEARLY Membership  Resident    Non-Resident  Adult (18+ years)       $99                  $150  Child (14-17 years)    $50                  $75  Daily Drop-In Fee $3 Residents; $5 Non-Residents   If you are serious about getting fit, staying in shape and getting a good old-fashioned workout without all the ""posing"" and pretentiousness of other gyms which are more like ""meeting places"" and ""meat markets"" for the young Scottsdale wannabes, this gym is definitely for you! Personally, I recommend the boxing classes because they will kick your butt, they are fun, get you fit and, in shape. :-) They just got new heavy bags so there are 2 heavy bags, 1 hooks bag, several ""Bob bags"", 2- double-ended bags and 3 speed bags in the main workout areas. Plus, a bunch more standing weighted-base heavy bags in the other ""kickboxing/Yoga room. And, in case you didnt notice from the picture, a full-size boxing ring.  Yes. I am totally endorsing this gym!  P.S. This is a ""no frills"", serious gym.  So, no whinnying and crying. Suck it up and do some push-ups!  ;-) Call them for more details:  (480) 312-2669"
5,"Theres a reason theres a banner that reads, Food Network Challenge Winner, hanging in their farmer market booth. Ive had Pastry Chef Chriss gingerbread cookies; biscotti; coconut/chocolate cookies; and their carrot cake, and they have all been really, really, reaaaaally good!  But today, at the Ahwatukee Farmers Market, I was knocked out by what she calls ""Lemon Sunshine.""  Words can not describe how delicious their lemon and cream & graham crust tart/pie is. Lemon tarts/pies are among my all time favorite desserts. I thought that the ones I had from TKs bakeries and Veronique Mauclerc were as perfect as a lemon tart/pie could be. Slice Cake Designs Lemon Sunshine pie is dangerously perfect... A must try!!!!!"
4,"Ive been frequenting the Dollar store for the past three weeks while shopping for a work project. I have bought just about every pair of safety scissors in Phoenix, playdough, and other small manipulatives for elementary reading and math kids. Anytime I need cleaning supplies for home I head straight to this Dollar Tree Store. They have the BEST carpet cleaner called LAs Totally Awesome Carpet Spot and Stain Remover. It really works!! The Dollar Tree is a great place to stock up on cheap party decorations. Shopping at the Dollar Tree is kinda like buying a Saturn. You know the price before you walk in and how much youre going to spend before you check out. I love that!"
4,"Ive been here three times now and have yet to have a bad meal, or walk away complaining. The food is consistent. The prices are fair. And the service is great. Nice hidden gem without stupid long waits at breakfast. Score!"
1,This place is over priced and the service is horrible. I went there with my feiends and the server was very rude and degrading!
3,"Average Cajun food, nothing special.  I came here late on a Tuesday night.  Few people there.  Its a dive of a place in a strip mall.  A bluesman was playing nice quiet blues on an electric guitar...very nice.  Kinda scruffy place with all the basic Cajun staples.  Nothing fancy.  Decent brews.  I think the bar tender was waiting tables.  I probably wont be back, but I had heard it was great and wanted to try it.  I think I like more upscale digs and fancier/pricier fare."
4,"Awesome Saturday breakfast buffet (until 11am). I wanted a resort style brunch setting to treat my folks too while they were in town. The service here is impeccable as are the grounds, which deserve a good walking through after you gorge yourself on heaps of fresh fruit, pastries, bacon and eggs. Located in central Scottsdale."
1,"The worst Thai food Ive ever had! This place was recommended to us by another couple, and wow was I disappointed! Everything was completely blase and tasteless, the only exception being the extreme spiciness of my fiances entree(probably to make up for the lack of other spices)... dont bother with this place."
3,"This is simply a poor substitute for the Los Dos Molinos in South Phoenix.  It is a pale shade of itself.  The salsa is spicy, but it doesnt have any of the same excitement.  I think its partly the downtown location in a strip mall, (not that 98% of restaurants in Phoenix arent in strip malls).  But the Mexcian Pizza and Chicken enchiladas just didnt have the same loving kick and spice.  When you are craving Mexican downtown, thisll do in a pinch.  But make room and time to head out to the original deal, the one with 5 alarm salsa and huge patios.  Margaritas the size of ones head and bring a group of friends to indulge!"
4,"Though perhaps not the place you may pick for a special brunch with champagne and chocolate brioche French toast (a signature breakfast at the Sofitel Philadelphia), the Good Egg is my choice for neighborhood breakfast that offers consistent service and food in a comfortable atmosphere. No matter how busy the restaurant becomes, and on Sunday it is packed,  the staff is always friendly and welcoming. You may have to wait for a table but the waits are never excessive and there is the coffee trolley where you can help yourself while waiting.  Even more remarkable is that even at its busiest (read Mothers/ Fathers days), service is speedy and attentive and the kitchen never seems to slow down.  Someone here knows how to run a restaurant! The menu contains a large assortment of the usual breakfast fare, eggs, pancakes, french toast, etc, all well prepared and tasty.  In addition there are is a good number of health conscious offerings and even those less healthy dishes can be requested to be made with egg whites or egg beaters, and non-starch substitutes (cottage cheese, fruit, and tomatoes. etc).  Some of my favorites include the Hey Ricky Omelet, Huevos Ranchero ,or my indulgence a (as in one huge singular)  buckwheat pancake with (my choice of ""fillings): chocolate chips ( I admit my addictions), pecans, and bananas...  We always opt for the patio and even in the scorching summer heat; the misters make this a great outdoor picnic with the best people watching in Phoenix. After you have been here a few times you feel like part of the family and with their frequent dinner program they offer even more incentive to return."
2,"The queso is ridiculously good... seriously. And the homemade tortillas are also outstanding. Aside from that, everything is average at best. As mentioned by others, this is Americanized Mexican cuisine. This is not autentica comida Mexicana, mi amigos! We had been once before and thoroughly enjoyed the food. Hence making it a point to visit again on our most recent trip to Arizona. We started with the chips and salsa set for the table - delicious. I ordered a bunch of queso for the table, and I started with a Tortilla Soup. It was hilariously underwhelming. I made the joke that it was kitchen scraps, and it looked the part. It was light tomato broth with a bunch of vegetables, a gob of cheese and a small corn on the cob on top. Yes, a small corn on the cob is on top. It was lousy and I wouldnt recommend it. We ordered a pound of chicken fajitas and a half pound of vegetable ones (thanks to the vegetarian fiancee). It went surprisingly far for five of us... but the veggies werent grilled much, which is sad because they were otherwise delicious. Also, the chicken fajitas only had one piece of green pepper and one of red on top. It should be lush with peppers and onions that have been grilled or possibly even caramelized (the onions). Daniel E. wrote in his review the same concern, that there should be ""more than a pile of onions,"" that he expected at least some green, red or yellow peppers. The fajitas were good and quite filling. The accompaniments were decent - cheese, lettuce, sour cream and the like. Nothing fancy, certainly no frills. So much potential, but it fails on almost everything. Its a true shame. This place needs to be on Restaurant Impossible with Robert Irvine... badly... This time around... the service was really lousy. And my fiancee found a bug deep down in her water. Very disappointing. The waitress first replied confirming what size bug it was, and then explained it and claimed that ""were not dirty, its just the food smell."" Then she apologized and walked away. We think she deducted a soda from the final bill... but nothing else. A bug! And the entry foyer smelled like a high school locker room... it was foul on the way in and out. Sad to say that we may likely not return in the future. Im not sure if our family and friends in the greater Phoenix area will either after the bug incident."
5,"I saw the reviews of this Arribas and thought to myself, ""Are these people talking about the same Arribas I went to last night?"" I went there, and had an awesome time! Service was prompt, and if something was off, our server Jeff (who was amazing) explained why something happened, but didnt blame anyone, and didnt use server jargon. I do understand the jargon, but it was nice for someone to not have to resort to it.  Warm chips and salsas + warm bean dip came out = awesome and the spicy salsa was calling my name. It burned, but I loved it. I ordered the Rio Grande enchiladas with the carne abodoba, and ordered it extra spicy. (Of course, I would) I was with my girl (and she likes strawberry margaritas) so we split the house margarita for 2, frozen with sugar of course. Im not a huge margarita person, but it was really good. She ordered the cheese enchiladas. (She takes safe choices when we go eat) -more on the margaritas in a min-  Food come out and seriously, it was some of the best spanish/mexican Ive had in a while. Its good to see an establishment take risks with seasoning their food. It was fresh! Which is hard to find these days and Im pretty sure the people who own Arribas own a hatch chile farm because I rarely saw anything about jalapenos or serranos or even habaneros. Which is cool. Those hatch chiles are slanged around that place like coke in studio 54 in the 70s. Im not kidding, when you order your entree and they ask you what kind of beans you want. Black, pinto, or the 3rd kind that is a combo of black/pinto with some onion, tomatoes, and of course, whats that? Hatch chiles! I highly recommend them. I liked how Arribas uses the hatch chiles. It sets them apart. It brought the heat! After dinner, I ordered another margarita... This time, I asked Jeff of a recommendation. Why do I do this? Because the people that work at any restaurant know the food/drinks there more than you will ever know. Nuff said. He brought out some margarita I dont even know the name. It kicked my ass, thank god my girl was driving home, thats all Im going to say. Thanks! Thats why this place gets 5 stars. It deserves it in my opinion. I think because this place takes chances with seasoning and overall outlook is why so many people might be unhappy with Arribas or this location in general. I on the other hand PROMOTE this thought process. I dont want food thats bland that a place kicks off the line to the people outside than enjoy bland food. That makes for a BLAND place thats filled with, well, bland people. This place uses heat, salt, pepper, and other spices that I dont know of. What a freaking great idea! Too hot for you? Then dont eat food that is 99% based on heat. I will surely be going back, and I wont have a bad time."
1,"I cant even believe I actually went to this restaurant.  My feeling was that if the Tommy Bahama clothing and its wearers were any indication of the dining experience, it was going to be unoriginal and in poor taste.  Alas my friend wanted to go there was his birthday lunch so....  Let me be clear that Im not a food snob at all.  Just last week I enjoyed a lunch of Nachos Bell Grande and a bean and cheese burrito at Taco Bell very, very much.  That was far superior to this lunch at Tommy Bahama.  The decor was comfortable and breezy.  Everything else  - not so much.  1st its nice that they bring you bread and butter, but a sweetly flavored butter?  Why mess with the pure goodness of butter?  The glass of lemonade I ordered was sickeningly sweet, and I am a notorious for my sweet tooth.  It was undrinkable until I cut it with water.  The coconut shrimp also had an overly sweet sauce.  So much so that we could each only eat 1 of 6 shrimp.  I got the crab bisque which was crazy salty, and in my opinion, contained previously frozen hence rubbery crab meat.   As it was my friends birthday, they brought him a complimentary dessert.  Very nice. He got the newest one which was some sort of chocolate/caramel-filled cake with oreo crust, chocolate mousse topping, sprinkled with crushed Heath bar.  Sounds good, right?  Vile, absolutely vile.  Overly sweet except for the oreo crust that was saturated in butter.  On an update note - it was not the nasty sweet butter they serve with the bread though.     My final issue was with our young, highly attentive server.  He was very sweet and well-intentioned.  However I feel that every server in the world needs to stop speaking to customers in the collective.  Dont say ""are we enjoying our coconut shrimp?"" or ""are we ready for dessert?""  Unless Ive badly misinterpreted our relationship, ""we"" arent doing anything together. Just a pet peeve -  I still tipped him 22% and kept my mouth shut about this odd little quirk.   oh and the bill for coconut shrimp appy, quesadilla, cup of crab bisque, lemonade and glass of white wine?  $52.  for lunch.   Tommy Bahama and I just didnt work out at all."
5,"As a bonafide recovering Art Bitch, I give this university gallery the blue ribbon award for kickassery! Truly a ""hidden gem"" (i hate that phrase) in Tucson, the collection and the revolving pieces never cease to impress me. I have brought almost every single tourist from the east coast to this gallery, including some photography professors, and they leave with snoooty mouths agape that in this pleasant little desert town resides a high-caliber, well manicured collection of the arts.  I am always upset when I visit and I cant stop by this gallery-and dont miss out out on their catalogs, magazines, books, postcards and prints they have in the atrium as unique gifts/decoration. Splleeeendid."
4,"Finally tried the only ""real"" Chinese food restaurant in Maricopa.  Played it safe with Sweet & Sour Chicken, Crab Rangoon, and Pork Fried Rice.  With delivery, it was only $14 +tip.   The fried rice was great, it was a little more of the ""East Coast"" style I grew up with, dark w/ lots of juicy nuggets of roast pork.  The chicken was good, but then again, it was a (VERY) safe choice, next time Ill try one of the ""Chefs Specialties"".  Crab Rangoon was good, unlike Panda Express, there was crab (krab?) in the cream cheese.   If youre in Maricopa and craving Chinese, dont go to Panda Express, definitely give Great Wall a try, its in the same plaza as Panda and if your party is 2 or more, youll save yourself some money!"
1,"I am a huge tea drinker, so when I found out about Teavana I was excited.  I entered the store and an employee asked if I cared to try some tea. After sampling several different blends, I chose three to purchase.  The employee asked if I wanted to get a large canister for a dollar more than the one I had picked. Not realizing this store sells tea by the ounce rather than per canister, I said ""sure."" He chatted as he filled the containers, never mentioning the price, and once done took my debit card and rang me up. I didnt pay attention to the cost and when I looked at the receipt when I got home my heart nearly stopped. I spent $350 on tea. I returned it and they didnt give me too much trouble. Now I always check the total before handing my card over, and I wont go back. I feel like they totally swindled me."
4,Not a bad theater. The staff is friendly and the sound is ok.
1,I dont get it. This place is crazy busy with no Manager in sight and in hiding during the busy dinner hour. No name tags on the employees. I was scolded for pointing over the sneeze glass to the sauce that I wanted since nothing was labeled. I guess I violated the health code. Thanks for not locking me up. I told my family we will not spend one more dime here.
4,I have been here twice so I know whats the best items for my taste. Would give another star if the Mongolian grill had more items and sauces. Trying the evening buffet tomorrow with 2 teenage sons one whose 18 and a football player. Should definitely get my moneys worth!
5,"This is a great MMA gym.  Instructors are profesional, the facility is clean, and they work well with all experience levels."
5,"We just moved from Florida and I was looking for a Restaurant with great food, service and a great view to celebrate my husbands 61st Birthday on Friday. It was suggested by a friend to try A Different Point of View... We are so glad we did... Let start by saying the drive up the cliffs to the restaurant was an adventure my Kia wasnt happy about but we made it.. AMAZING views... Greeted by a valet who had plenty of energy and was very informative. We picked the elevator to go to the 4th floor as opposed to the stairs... We were seated in a corner window table with views beyond belief! Greeted by our server , Larry, he wished my husband Happy Birthday and brought a passion fruit drink that was delish compliments of the Chef! Nice touch... Ask for Larry if you go.. he was right in tune with our special requests... We ordered their Signature Salad and I said we would share it... Larry had the kitchen serve it as a split.. Larry made the dinner and celebration very Special. My husband ordered the Rib Eye but my husband doesnt like any thing on his rib eye and doesnt like anything else on his plate with the meat.. Larry must hears this all the time and he explained exactly how it will be plated and assured him that no sauce or veggies would touch the meat. See pictures to see our meals. I held my breath until the plates came out and my Husband loved it- it was perfect. He ordered it medium rare and it came out perfectly cooked and full of flavor and it cut like butter. I ordered the Pork Tenderloin and it was tender and full of flavor the corn cakes were like little polenta pancakes they were delishish... The bread and the specialty butter and pesto and goat cheese dips were also full of flavor...  The dessert was a Chocolate Espresso cake also very good. The sun was setting and the lights were twinkling-- Just a wonderful experience..  I cant wait to go back when its a little cooler to sit outside...Dont miss this wonderful casual affordable piece of Heaven!"
5,"The food was absolutely delicious.  Was very surprised in finding a good Asian restaurant here in Phoenix.  We had the papaya salad with soft shell crab, Phnom Penh noodle soup, and the lehong noodles.  All were delicious and very SE Asian.  I could not believe how great the food was.  But the best part was the grass jelly drink - it brought me back to my childhood.  Cant wait to try the other dishes here.  A definite must try here in Phoenix."
2,"I am changing my review - lately because of bad economy, they are not getting enough customers, their food quality has gone down. I wont waste my time or money on this."
5,This place is awesome they r going to replace a bad  tire for me for free that another discount tire put on they r awesome
3,"Ive been to happy hour here on a few occasions now and I have to say that Im becoming more and more fond of Geisha. The prices are pretty decent, but what really makes this a great happy hour place is the ambience - its lively and fun! Happy hour is 4p - 7p every day and is half off sake bombs, appetizers, house sushi rolls...and I just realized specialty drinks as well! I need to go back so I can try the Hello Kitty and Harajuku Lover specialty drinks! Both look delicious.  Not the most amazing sushi and appetizers, but definitely not bad considering the price. And for me during happy hour anyway, its really more about the company and drinks than the food. Happy Happy Hour Hopping!"
5,"This is one of my favorite little gems in Phoenix. Ive never had better pho than here. I usually order the ""spicy beef sate"" pho, which is miles above the rare beef pho. My family and I also order the pork ""spicy treats"" which is a roll-your-own spring roll. Its delicious and fun! One order feeds all five of us.  The owner is also extremely nice. They also offer discounts to ASU students! Have to love that."
5,Man the chompie sliders is the bomb.  Wish there were some in LA.  Man taste so good and flavor.
5,"What a great surprise stumbling across this bank!  Open 7 days a week with lobby service I have banked with the Mega Uber Banks and have been nickeled and dimed (literally) with service fees. I opened both a savings and checking account here.  Since my company does not offer direct deposit the associate told me I would have to have a traditional checking account with service fees.  Im thinking - here we go again.  But it was one of those think on your feet moments.  Off they went (Ill assume to get approval).   They let me open up a type of checking account that only charges you for check printing - No other fees and pays interest.  In fact, if you use a non-MidFirst Bank ATM, they will refund you the service fees.  How refreshing with the current state of banking."
5,"After four years of living in AZ I finally found Mexican food that appeals to me and my husband. Lets just say they changed my husbands view on tacos. He never swayed from eating vegetarian burritos until he got a hold of their carne asada tacos. In the last 4 months we lived in AZ we went there almost every week and brought friends, whom now cant get enough of them too. They are reasonably priced, have great customer service and everything we have eaten so far has been fabulous. If you are looking for great food and youre not concerned with being in a fine dining Mexican restaurant, then look no further.  We miss you Los Taquitos....."
5,"I have never had BBQ in the South, Texas, or anywhere outside of California (except Bobby Q), but of all the places Ive tried, Bobby Q is my current favorite BBQ place EVER!  I found this place on Yelp and came here while on a trip to Arizona.  The place was pretty crowded but we only  waited about 15-20 minutes.  We ordered babyback ribs, St. Louis ribs, corn, and mac&cheese.  They also give you DELICIOUS AMAZING CORNBREAD! Everything was excellent.  The St. Louis ribs were the best ribs I have ever had.  They were extremely tender and had a nice flavorful bark on the  outside with dark grill marks.  Their BBQ sauce was equally awesome and the kind I like -- a bit more on the sweeter side, less on the vinegary side.  The babyback ribs were also tasty, but not as flavorful (and less meat of course) than the St. Louis ones.  The sides were good but more forgettable due to the sheer perfection of their ribs. I dont know if I will ever be in Phoenix again, but this place is a must-return if I ever am.  Oh and at the end of the meal, they gave us complimentary, piping hot FRESH cinnamon donuts!  That double-won me over.  I want Bobby Q right now."
1,"Fake (or rather condescending) service from the ""Service Manager""...and he didnt even acknowledge me when I asked the status of my car (uh, more like IGNORE). Ended every sentence with an impolite ""No maam"" or ""Yes, maam""... ya get the scenario. Basically, the guy was a real JERK. They couldnt even figure out HOW to fix my car, even when I TOLD them what was wrong with it ( had been diagnosed at the Dealership). Two guys were sitting there staring at the computer (as if it was going to magically speak to them). At least they didnt charge me, but what a waste of time waiting for 90 minutes...."
5,Tasty Thai- is. But it could also be called Delicious Thai. And the service is always great!
5,i go to debon every 3 weeks for aki the hairdresser.  shes very nice and asks you a lot of quesitons to make sure you get what you want.  she is reasonably priced.
5,"If you are looking for only raw vegan food, this is your place.  Nothing is cooked, everyhthing is 100% raw.  They offer a variety of creative options from appetizers, wraps, soups, pizza and pasta.  They have freshly squeezed juices, smoothies and a variety of different health shots.  The dessert is yummy as well.  This is a must try!"
5,OMG this place is good. Great Italian beef. Great burgers. FRY SAUCE. I dont know how theyre pulling off such good food with what they have but its awesome and I will be eating here if Im in the area and hungry.
4,"Ive always sorta had mixed feelings about this theater. On the one hand, there arent a whole lot of options to see independent film in AZ besides this place and Camelview, so Ive got thank Dan Harkins for those outlets. On the other hand, there are times when this theater plays the SAME movie for weeks. An examples of this was with What The Bleep Do We Know?. I hate it when this place does that, but its nice to see films here that wouldnt normally get play at Camelview (ie. Che: Parts 1 & 2, Let The Right One In, etc.). In all, this place is a bit like my own Cinema Paradiso because I have so many fond memories in this theater. There was a Pulp Fiction screening when I was in high school and I got to go to an advanced screening of Slumdog Millionaire and actually got to meet Danny Boyle when he showed up for a Q&A afterward. I just wish they had midnight screenings of classic/grindhouse/cult films like The New Beverly in LA."
2,"As far as teppanyaki restaurants go this one isnt top of my favorites. 2 stars for good service and a nice setting... Im docking 3 stars for my food being over cooked and not being offered anything to replace it, and our chef not doing any sort of classic teppanyaki cooking tricks (making oil light on fire, flipping shrip at people, bouncing his utensils around.. ect). Decent place to eat, but not a value for what you pay for."
1,"when i worked in retail my paycheck was spent before i got paid. therefore, i relied heavily on coupons and splitting meals w all of my other poor college friends. well, i hit the jackpot. $15 coupon for a FEAST. the picture on the coupon showed everything we would get: a huge steak, shrimp, and lobster PLUS 2 sides. there were 3 of us- this was PLENTY.  it was prom night too so we were initally fooled with how popular it was. popular for prom girls with light up clear shoes (not even lying), if that says anything about the crowd for you... our waitress stops by our booth and just stares at us. one of my friend kinda looks around at me and our other friend, then back at the waitress. ill have a diet coke? then our waitress writes it down and doesnt say anything but looks at my other friend. i lost it and started laughing. why isnt she talking to us? this is so weird.  we ended up asking for a different waitress, then found out the coupon was a big fat liar. you didnt get all of that. it just says you do but you dont. the food ended up being nasty. probably one of the worst meals ive ever had.  as were leaving susy talks a lot waitress trips over my friend and it was all too awkward bc i couldnt control laughing.  awful food, awful service, AND the bathrooms were some of the grossest i had ever been in.  if wal-mart ran a restaurant, this would be it."
2,"My wife and I were downtown with some friends, and decided to check this place out. I ordered a pasta lunch, and chose Penne Alla Campagna and another penne with tomatoes and Mozzarella. Meh, it was just okay. The food was just okay, kind of bland and a bit overpriced. I did snag a small slice of pepperoni pizza from one of the kids at our table that was actually the best part of my meal. Would I go back, nope no sir"
2,"I have been a long time customer at this car wash with this location. I have been going there since it Changed from Weiss Guys to Diamond Car wash and now its known as Francis and Sons. It seems the service has declined for each change of ownership.   Today was the tip of the iceberg and I will not be going there again. The past 2 visits have proven to me that their customer service has rapidly declined.   I understand that every business needs to ""Upsell"", but it becomes an annoyance when they keep bugging me 5,6,7,8 times after I have said no. Dont even get me started on their glass repair salesmen.... I always get the Premium auto wash, a few weeks ago I went and when I got home I noticed they had not cleaned my dash or center console (which is included in premium). I also noticed they had not wiped down my tires after applying Armor All and it all splattered up to the sides of my vehicle after driving away, I wrote these off as a simple mistake and that it probably would not happen again.   Todays experience was worse. I took my truck in for a wash and I told the guy I did not have time for a hand wax (upsell) I was then pressured into buying it in advance so I could come back another day and get it waxed. No was not an answer to this guy, I had to actually walk away to leave this Pressured UPSELL.   Again, I purchased the premium wash. They called for the vehicle and I noticed that there were little black spots (mud?) all over the side of the truck. I told the guy about this and he said ""its ready."" I explained that it wasnt and started using my finger to poke at what was probably 20-30 little black spots all over the side, he gave me a disgusted look and told me he had to go get a clean rag. I asked for a manager.   The manager came and had the guy wipe the spots off, but did not seem to care at all and walked away before the guy wiped down half of the spots. I had already given a tip to the first guy and this guy stood there expecting a tip, I am generous with tips, but will not tip more because I had to ask them to fix their mistake.   Upon entry of my vehicle I noticed there was still some dirt on the floor and my center console armrest was not cleaned. I only took the truck in due to my dog leaving paw prints on the center armrest and hair all over the place...   I got an oil change at Dannys Car Wash at Tempe Marketplace a few weeks ago, and was so Impressed by their service and car wash service that I will make the 20 minute trip to go up there for my car wash from now on."
4,This is a great place to take your time and enjoy someones company. The food is fresh and the service always friendly. If you are looking to be fed fast this is not the place to go. Fondue is fun! If you have the time and the money this is a place to have a great evening.
5,"I had to do some painting and needed help locating items and suggestions from the staff and boy were they ever helpful.  Nothing like Home Depot, where you have to go and hunt down an employee and when you do they cant wait to get back to their break or whatever was more important than their customer.  I was just overwhelmed by the courteous and quick service I received at this location.  Even their quality of garden plants surpassed several other super stores."
4,They have Veggie Dogs! The veggie dog will run you about 40 calories fewer than the regular turkey dog. Happy eating :)
4,"Games- great. Game prices- decent. Food- Edible, but nothing to write home about. Food prices- WAY too high for the quality. Bar- Weird. The 1st bar Ive heard of that doesnt carry Baileys or some type of Irish cream liqueur. Drinks- Meh, stick w/ beer. Service- Also weird. Ive had the best service here when its crazy busy and the absolute worst when my friends and I are the only people to be waited on. A good time, if youre going for games and basic drinks."
3,"It is absolutely no fun to have a connection at this airport! It was definitely  not designed to be ""post-911"" friendly. Let me give you an example so that you will know what I mean:  We fly in from San Francisco and are told that we will have to go to another building via a bus. We get off the plane and walk...and walk...and then walk some more, looking around trying to find where to go to in order to catch this bus. Finally, we found someone who told us where to go. We walked and walked, and then walked some more until we finally caught the bus. We then had to find the correct gate and go through security again...  Flash forward 8 days. We fly in and go through customs. (This, BTW, was a great experience because we were the only international flight going through customs.) We rechecked our luggage and are told that we have to go to another building. Yep, you know what I am about to say...we floundered around, having to ask where to go several times. Finally, we found the right place and got on the bus. It then proceeded to go to various parking lots, dropping off and picking up other passengers. My husband and I looked at each other, worried that we were on the wrong bus. Since it was already 4 p.m. and we had not had lunch, we were getting very worried that we would not have time to grab lunch.  Finally, my husband asked the driver and he indicated that we were indeed on the right bus. We continued going around parking lots until we came upon another bus. The driver told everyone on our bus that we could sit around and wait for 10-15 minutes, or we could get on the next bus and get there quicker. Of course, we all grabbed our suitcases and boarded the next bus, which proceeded to take us to the correct stop (after picking up additional passengers along the way.)  Next ,we entered the terminal and jumped on an elevator to take us to the security line. There were only 2 lines and of course, we got in the line with the family who had to go back 6 or 7 times because they kept trying to go through the security line with belts on, shoes on, liquids in  their suitcases...you get the picture!  Anyway, we finally got to our gate and were able to grab a slice of pizza before boarding our plane (not before enduring the antics of a 70-year-old United Airlines power-hungry granny who couldnt seem to get her act together, but was determined to show everyone who was boss...)"
4,"tried this place due to a restaurant.com gift certificate, 4 stars for service, we had an awesome and attentive server which made it great for first visit. drinks were good. went with friends and did some sharing to try the different dishes we ordered. the salmon quesadillas was on the fishy side, the pollo relleno good but a little dry and didnt get the poblano and goat cheese flavors that drew me to choosing the dish, the cilantro mousse sounded more interesting on the menu but was cream cheese and cilantro, the Obama burrito was the winner on our table though. great salsa. would come back and try other dishes and tae in some live music."
4,"We went to Ocean Prime the other night and it was delicious.  I dont know if it was worth the money but it was definitely good.  The setting is as attractive as any restaurant I can remember, with classical contemporary decor and a very cool display of alcohol bottles in the bar. I was in a party of seven and the prevalent dish was the bone-in filet.  We had heard it was better than the steakhouses in Chicago.  Well Im from Chicago, and trust me, you get a better (and bigger) bone-in filet at Joes.  But it was still a delicious steak.  The sides were terrific and the salads were good too.  But those prices!  Wow, value is not this restaurants strong suit. About the only other thing Ill add is the service was below average, a concern considering what the prices were like.  Our server tried hard but he was too slow and didnt get our order right."
5,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this office!  During my high-risk pregnancy I spent a lot of time at this office and in the hospital.  Both Dr. Hahn and Dr. Spieker were fantastic, very knowledgable and easy to talk to.  I trust them completly as they did everything to ensure both myself and my baby were well taken care of.   I have since seen Dr. Cyr for a quick appointment whom is very sweet."
4,"Tandoori Times Volume 1, Issue 1, Number 1.  Limited run.  Copyright 2009, Mejimbo Enterprises.  All Rights Reserved.   Dateline 7 May 2009 Scottsdale, Arizona     Yelpers Jim W and Audrey W were reportedly seen enjoying lively conversation and delicious Indian food with Donald S and Carin S.  Witnesses claim the group was laughing loudly at times.  One bystander reported, ""That was a guffaw.  That outburst right there was definitely a guffaw.  Wild stuff.""     Sources have related to this publication that the group dined on two appetizers, one known as a bread basket which consisted of four types of naan bread.  Jim W was overheard to say, ""I really like the onion naan.""  The other appetizer may have been Aloo Tikki.  This has not been confirmed as yet.  In any case the plate containing the reported Aloo Tikki was cleaned by the foursome, several even going so far as to swab at the remaining sauce on the plate.     The above sources also reported that the table was served an order of the Friday daily special of Kahari Shrimp.  It was overheard by a nearby table that the shrimp was ""...flavorful with strong notes of garlic and ginger.""  This has not substantiated, however.     Audrey W reportedly was served the Lamb Korma which she was rumored to have noted was ""Yummy.""     Carin S apparently was served the Chicken Masala and Donald S may have been served some sort of Vindaloo that included potato.  It seems there was considerable sharing of the dishes around the table and the main dishes may have been spooned over what some experts have suggested was a basmati rice with various herbs and spices.     An unnamed source has informed this publication that while Jim W claims to have particularly enjoyed the food and festive atmosphere which included a belly dancer and some swordplay, he was displeased with the excessive sound level produced by the in-house sound system and even requested that the music be reduced.     Jim Ws blog had a statement this morning that read, in part; ""...ears havent hurt the next morning like that since my last rock concert.  I really liked the food but I wouldnt go back on a night when they have dancing again."""
3,"This Dunkin Donuts is hit or miss. When i run in here for just coffee, the service is usually very fast and prompt. When i run in there to order coffee and food, that usually becomes a circus. There have been times when ive waited over 20 minutes for my food. Usually its not a problem, but when you have a business meeting that you have to attend to, it is.  Fast food, pffft. Bring a sleeping bag."
5,"Im not a fan of ice cream, I just dont find it appealing and its too high in calories/saturated fat. However I do love frozen yogurt, and ironically its much less fattening, yet more satisfying. At 25 calories an ounce, Golden Spoons is the best around. There have a large array of flavors to choose from and they rotate flavors each month, they also have seasonal flavors such as pumpkin pie and egg nog. You also can get more than one flavor combined. They also have a wide variety of toppings to choose from, from gummy bears to low-fat brownies. Even though their yogurt is non-fat and low calorie, adding toppings can quickly add a lot more calories, I suggest going with chocolate or rainbow sprinkles (adds less than 50 calories), or if you like fruit, go with that."
1,"the owner was dishonest, she posted a menu outside with lower pricing to attarct traffic, and then charge higher pricing menu inside. she also charge me 12% sales tax, which is illegal in tempe, which suppose to be only 9.3% very rude manner, not recommended"
5,Good JIB. Fast an friendly.
1,"From my door, its a five minute stroll through the greenbelt to Dukes. They have a nice patio. They have enough TVs to show all MLB/NFL/NBA games. They have plenty of shuffleboard and pool tables. Yet, Ive only been to Dukes a few times and I am not going back. This place is just bad. Mixed drinks are poured short and use cheap mixers (such as bottled sour mix for margaritas). They offer a pretty basic beer selection. I think PBR pitchers might be more modestly priced, but that might be only when theyre on ""special."" The food is pretty bad, even for bar food. And pricey. Sure, the menu is gigantic and Ive tried many different items, but I didnt find anything good. Everything seems to be made from ""freezer to fryer"" or packaged products. Im not exaggerating: the burger and fries for about $8 is a thin, previously frozen patty with a handful or supermarket fries. I could go on about salads, sandwiches, and ribs. In the same price range, you can get a much better version of anything on the menu at Four Peaks or Zipps or even Devils Advocate. One of the owners was there on a few occasions. I guess being the boss of (and drinking in) his own bar is some sort of dream of his. He treats the place like his kingdom. Hell ask patrons ""how is everything?"" and get mad at them if they have anything negative to say. I feel bad for the rest of the service staff; they seem to be above average, but when the overall situation is this bad it just doesnt matter. In this city, sports bars are a dime a dozen. Id rather go elsewhere."
2,"I thought I was really in for one of the best burgers of my life due to my fellow Yelpers reviews but was sort of disappointed.  I did like the fries in the shopping cart, that was pretty creative, but they werent anything special.  Same way I felt about the Delux burger.  The meat was dry and the condiments were lacking which made it worse.  I thiknk the bun was the best part.  I did do a cool beer flight which was nice.  The atmosphere is pretty neat here but I probably wont visit again if Im in the area."
4,"Great Bellini, loved the Seared Ahi, Portabella and Beef Tenderloin Flatbread and Spinach and Artichoke dip! I highly recommend you select the same on happy hour! 3-6pm 7 days a week!"
4,Great Thai and Chinese food. Friendly family staff. We were served by their very cool 11year old son. Kind of place you want to support. Food was excellent and very reasonable. Go for the curry-
5,"My favorite Mexican food.  THE BEST BEAN BURRO ENCHILADA STYLE IN THE WORLD (yes Ive tried them all)  Get the red enchilada sauce, and a tortilla on the side."
4,"Kids eat free on Wed and now also Sundays with specific adult purchase!  The white pizzas are fantastic!! mmmmmm. The kids get slices (as a kids meal) and the cheese ones are good, too. The seasonal salads have been wonderful--current one I think is called Strawberry Fields? it has nice greens, almond slices, strawberries, apples, cheese, and 2 different dressings.  Got the calzone last night--not recommended. The large (I ordered a small and she made a mistake) was HUGE---large enough for about 5 or 6 people, unless everyone has a huge appetite for a lotta carbs. The dough was uncooked on the inside, and the broccoli and chicken were cold :(.  I guess that process needs some work. At this particular location, theres always a gal that greets us and keeps calling us ""guys"" in every sentence. Its just a little weird, but the rest of the staff is great.  Again with this place, like at China King, never sure why there doesnt seem to be many people eating in. They do deliver, so maybe lots of ppl have delivery? They do have patio seating with misters, but right now, kinda hot to eat outside. Probably lovely in the cooler weather. Kids meals come with a small sundae, so that makes them happy.   The fountain drinks are Pepsi. The diet pepsi tastes bad, and the diet dr pepper doesnt taste much better. They do, however, have filtered water. Your choice of filtered NYC water (tastes great!) or filtered Chandler water. BTW this location is in the same plaza where Outback, Nordstrom Rack, Famous Footwear, SAS, etc are, so the parking is a little cramped. Not much NYPD can do about that, but its annoying."
4,"Ive been here twice and my favorite item has been their version of tiramisu. Its not soaked in espresso or whatever the local italian eateries are using these days..its made with champagne! Its light and fluffy..its like eating a cloud from heaven. Very much a date place.. It has a ""romantic"" atmosphere so dont go there if youre not trying to give off that vibe. Otherwise great for a group setting..... Oh and for any potential cougars the waitstaff is delicious eye candy. ;)"
4,"I love this place!  Authentic mexican food at inexpensive prices.  Friendly and attentive staff.  The cleanest Filibertos I have seen.  I visit at least once a week during the lunch hour.  The Chile Rellenos are awesome, lightly battered, lots of spicy sauce... just simply delicious.  Taco Tuesdays (99 cent tacos) are a great bargain.  Complimentary salsa bar with multiple hot sauce type salsas, sliced cucumbers, and a fantastic spicy carrot/onion/jalapeno/chile salad... all free.  My only complaint is the salsa bar, soda fountains and cashier area, which are all located up front, can get very congested... I wish they could rearrange that somehow.  Oh, plus it would be nice to offer a chunky (pico de gallo) type salsa on the salsa bar, similar to Baja Fresh.  Check out the website for coupons - great deals!  You also will receive a bright orange (cant miss it) set of coupons with each purchase, to use on your next visit.  Im a fan!"
3,"It was a little expensive.  $65.80 for two apps, one drink, two sodas, two entrees, and one shared dessert. Highlights: The Grilled Wings were very good.   Nice and crisp, charred but not burned, and not too fatty.  I could have eaten two dozen of them. The Cheddar Potatoes were a hit at the table, liked by all. The Creme Brulee was excellent, and about twice the size that Torched Goodness offers, for 5 cents less than TG charges. Lowlights: The hummus was just plain, and there was something else they put on top of it, something a little bitter - ??  Not sure what it was, but it was not impressive. The ""half rack"" of ribs were pretty tiny for $14.95.  Not a lot of meat. The Flatiron Steak was also tiny, and overcooked.  Not very tasty at all. Mashed potatoes and Mac-N-Cheese were very pedestrian. All in all, I might go back, have 2 orders of the wings app, and finish with Creme Brulee.  But I wont go with the kids again, not for $75 with tip.  We could have eaten 3 times at Los Taquitos for that price."
4,"This review is for the bar ONLY!  First time I came in here it was packed to this gills, and no where to sit so we left.. Next! Second time I came here I met 2 of the strangest old women Ive ever encountered who tried to reel me into a marketing scam, wouldnt shut up about how lovely I was and how both of them wanted me as their daughter, then performed Reiki on me and my friend, waving their hands all around us eyes closed and chanting.. in front of the everyone. I couldnt help but bust out in laughter. Bartender laughed too, then poured more bourbon in my glass and winked. I really liked this place aside from the geriatric nonsense. Great vibe & I loved the entrance, you walk right through the kitchen and can observe the chefs working their magic. The interior is dark and sexy, with some of the coolest wallpaper Ive ever seen. I am hoping to write an update soon, because I desperately want to try the steak that I have heard so much about, but $60 for dinner is a little out of my budget, thanks to our economical crisis and being unemployed. *sigh*"
4,"The first thing to know about this Los Reyes location is that it is quite different from the one on 7th St!  Its a different menu here, for starters!  I had my heart set on my usual, a ""Torta Norteña, & a 99 cent Ceviché.  They dont have those things here, so I settled for the nearest looking sandwich, a ""Mexican Torta"".  (My server did say the ownership is the same as the Sunnyslope location.)  Anyhow, heres how it was for me here today: *  This is a good sized place, & I managed to find both a parking space & a comfortable table inside to land at, even though they were ROARING BUSY! *  My nice server almost immediately brought me a big basket of tortilla chips & two kinds of salsa, medium & hot!  Both were good.  (They dont even serve tortilla chips at Sunnyslope.) *  I ordered, & it took a little while for my sandwich to arrive, but as I said, they were super busy!  No problemo.  Meanwhile, I ate about half of my chips, & Señorita brought me ANOTHER big basket of them, & more salsa! *  My torta arrived, & it was BIG & DELICIOUS!  It comes with a side salad, which included some pimento & cucumber slices, lime halves, lettuce, & a fried quarter onion.  All this was good too (&  DID remind me of the other location). *  Gripes?  THREE TVs blabbing out a show in Spanish, fairly loud, & this place was noisy to begin with. SO?  ...I didnt care as much for the menu here as Sunnyslope, & the TVs were a bit of a nuisance, but with that said, I still think this is an very good place to eat, & the value was AMAZING at only $6.50 for everything!     :-))"
1,"I had such a nice experience here - Classic Chicken - the first time that I really wanted to go back. Second time, onion strings were so greasy I couldnt eat them, burger was okay. Third time, yesterday? Enough to say we wont go back. Ever.  Lovely and I sat in a sticky booth, he ordered 1/3 lb classic, me the bbq grilled chicken - both with a small soda. Soda was disgusting, flat, watery, gross. Upon the lovelys complaint, the bus boy brought him bottled water. I took one bite of my sandwich and was assaulted by hair. Gak. We got up and left our food. Jeff told the manager about the food and the soda, we got our money back with an apology saying they were sorry we didnt have a better experience. Um. A better experience??? Seriously? 15 dollars?  Ugh."
5,I love this place. Just to hang out on a Summer day on the patio and have a beer is like...the perfect day.  The food is awesome. The Kilt Lifter is tasty and thirst quenching.  The area is definitely lucky to have such a place.
5,"When I moved away, these were the tacos that I missed!  I stopped back today, and must say - it was exactly how I remembered!  The lunch specials are very reasonably priced at $5.99 and come with two items and rice and beans. I always get the hard taco - seasoned shredded beef, lettuce, and cheese in a deep fried corn tortilla - and the cheese enchilada. I could eat the rice and beans alone, both are so well seasoned and they definitely dont skimp on the cheese! The only thing to watch is that the red hot sauce can vary from visit to visit - some days its super hot, others - not so much. The wait staff is exceptionally friendly and always try to help me because my Spanish is so limited. The interior is large but very modest, there arent a lot of fancy decorations - this is a place to come for the food and service and  not th ambiance.  Still, one of my faves!"
4,Sakana is one of my two favorite neighborhood sushi joints. I love their calamari salad (although the one at this location is considerably smaller than the one on 59th ave) and agedashi tofu. The waitstaff is friendly and their bday song is always fun!  Insiders tip: ask for some real wasabi!
4,"Coming from a place and age where the most exotic ethnic food was considered to be Taco Time, I have spent  many years experimenting with all kinds of different foods.  One of my favorites is Indian food, and thanks to Microsoft and other tech companies, who use workers from India,  there are many more Indian restaurants now scattered throughout the country.  I am not an expert on the food (in fact, until recently, I never understood why Bollywood movies were always playing in Indian restaurants).  But I do enjoy it, and try every Indian restaurant I can find. I started going to Indian Paradise several years ago, and loved it.  It has a nice interior, and the servers are very nice and helpful.  I always seem to come in the early evening, before they are busy, and I always feel somewhat spoiled the way they treat me.  I love their masalas, curry, and naan, and have, of course, tried all of their Indian beers. I also find the different tandoori dishes delicious. I might note that I have never made it to the lunch buffet - I always seem to be golfing at that time so Im just never in the area .  But it is on my list of things to do. ***Bollywood - Bollywood is the name given to the Mumbai-based Hindi-language film industry in India.The term Bollywood was created by conflating Bombay (the city now called Mumbai) and Hollywood. Bollywood films are usually musicals. Few movies are made without at least one song-and-dance number. Indian audiences expect full value for their money; they want songs and dances, love interest, comedy and dare-devil thrills, all mixed up in a three hour long extravaganza with intermission."
2,Tried this place multiple times.  Many different items.  The only thing Worth remembering were the margaritas and the had pretty good service.
4,"Came in for my birthday burger, and decided on the garden-burger.  I hadnt tried it before, but Ill be trying it again, many more times.  I may even go vegetarian now that this baby is in my dietetic arsenal.  Love it!"
3,"3 Stars only because the house margarita and guacamole was so good.  The food was decent (fish tacos), however the patio atmosphere was a bit sad. I understand this is more of a bar than a fine dining restaurant but the patio tables had no place settings, condiments, etc... Just cheap metal tables and chairs. Also - there was no music out there, just this incessant humming of a back alley generator.   The service was a bit sporadic out on the patio as well. We were asked by three different servers if we have a server yet. Not much in the way of organization.  Maybe management just hasnt gotten around to fully organizing and furnishing the patio yet. I hope they do, because they are in a great location and the food and drinks give them lots of potential."
5,"Rarely give a 5, but truthfully? We set out to go to Giuseppes and stopped here...thought we were there...Im sure Giu. is good, but Arrivederci is the bomb. We will keep going on every visit. Reasonable and really, really authentic. Bueno Sera is your welcome..and they mean it! We loved it. . . reasonable, too. b"
5,"I love the Madagascar coconut white tea! The prices and very reasonable, only downfall for me is they dont list the caffeine content;("
5,"My friend has raved about this place for months, so for her birthday the girls and I got together for a little pizza field trip to LGO. It was amazing! Just as good as Mozza Pizzeria in LA., but around 400 miles closer. I also love the little grocery store. Very cute things to buy."
4,"The chicken shawarma is stellar. I get it to go at least once a month, substituting veggies for the rice. Slightly pricey, but you get a lot of food and its very consistent."
1,"I wouldnt write a review on a franchise unless it pissed me off. I prefer Papa Johns pizza to Dominos or Pizza Hut (by far), but there are some major service issues that have made my five ordering experiences pretty irritating. They cant find my house. Its not hard to find, I swear. Its a piece of cake, and a stones throw from a major crossroad. They had once taken two hours to deliver a pizza, saying they tried to call me (they didnt), only to return to the store and bring it back once I called. Naturally, I was delivered a lukewarm pizza, but in the nicest way possible was told that it was *my* mistake.  Unacceptable, in the age of online ordering and GPS systems in our phones, there is no excuse for getting lost in what is essentially a three mile drive in a straight line.  Without complaining, I had received a coupon for a free large pizza. Apology accepted. Upon visiting the store, I got to keep the card *after* ordering because they gave me the wrong toppings. Suckers. Also, they always take longer than the ETA, even in the middle of a weekday. Even now, I am waiting 70 minutes for a 30-40 minute order, and when I had called 15 minutes ago, was told it was on its way, but that construction was holding it up. Yes, there is construction, but you have taken this long in the past without it. Also, construction would not explain why it takes nearly an hour to produce one large pizza. I even tip nicely. I enjoy Papa Johns pizza, but unless my complaints are addressed, I will never order from this location again. I will encourage my friends to follow suit. RAWR."
3,"Hulas seems pretty hyped. I had drinks here that were OK. I had food here that was OK. Ill try it again and get an entree, but Ill not likely go out of my way to make it here."
2,"Sorry.  Im from Southern California so Im used to great Mexican food.  We were excited to try this restaurant, since we had read some great things about it.  However, the waiter was pompous and the food was mediocre.  We were in a party of four and we all ordered different meals.  The guacamole that was made from one avocado was $11.  The restaurant is in a scary location.  We had to park in a back alley.  It was agreed that the experience was a bust.  If youre in the area and want great food, go to Lons at the Hermosa, Elements at Sanctuary or True Food Kitchen."
4,"My husband & I have been going to one Zipps or another around town for the last 7 years...we currently live near the Old Town location...always our go to place to eat during the week when we dont feel like fixing dinner at home. Its your typical sports bar with a bit better food selection. You cant find a big 32oz beer for $4 ($3.50 @ happy hour) anywhere around town & their onion rings are outstanding, you can order 1/2 & 1/2 ...fries & onion rings with your burger or sandwich. We have never had an issue with the wait staff at any of the 3 different locations we have visited. The new boneless buffalo chicken skewers are fabulous & on special when regular wings are.  Happy Hour M-F 3-7pm $5 Wings & other stuff  Plus nightly specials 8pm-close & Weekend specials 11a-4p We love Zipps!!"
4,"5/7/12... I have to make a correction to my review as I received communication from someone with the club..  I was informed that they are not like other clubs as they have a ""Two Item"" minimum, not a two drink minimum.   So you can order a food dish and a drink to meet that minimum.  And I did confirm that one in our group ordered a bottled water which counted toward his minimum. So I stand corrected."
4,"The Breakfast Club is as good as youll find. The blueberry pancakes are superb, their coffee is beyond description. For a change of pace, try their Eggs Benedict, Southwestern style. A GREAT spot within walking distance...a beauty."
4,"Some amazing friends of mine surprised me and set up a whole birthday dinner at Jug n Barrel! This was my first time here and was shocked at how cute the place was. Even in a strip mall it actually had a fireplace which gave it a very cozy feel. The wine list is great and not too intimidating. We had a great server who even put together a wine flight to match my sweet tooth. The only thing that knocks a star (More like 1.5 stars) off the rating is the completely average food. We had a group of about 12 and ordered several appetizers and all of us ordered entrees. I dont think any of us were blown away by our meals.  Although I will not return for a meal, I would return for wine with friends."
5,"Im not gonna lie, I possibly had the best sunny side up eggs ever.  A simple dish so rarely cooked perfectly."
2,"Its was just OK! Liked the fresh jalapenos option, fries hardly had seasoning, was a bit pricey, but filling.  Free peanuts, but wasnt sure if it was ok to throw on the floor. They use the same color scheme as In N Out which I thought was humerous.  Ill still give it another try in a few months."
4,"We arrived at US Egg on St. Patricks Day at 10:00 am before the As vs. Giants Spring Training game and only had a wait of 15 minutes. Not bad to start! Promptly seated we were brought a pitcher of water and ordered our breakfast. The Denver Scramble is delicious! My husband ordered the Hash & eggs - reasonably priced, quick service and a ton of food to start your long days off right!"
4,"2 for 1 drinks at night, awesome homemade veggie burger & by far some of the BEST salad dressings Ive ever had. Shrimp & fruit salad with the champagne dressing was amazing. Their house dressing is just as good. By far my fave meal is now brunch. I ordered the ""best egg white omelet youve ever had"" & I must agree! The omelet was huge and packed full of awesomeness and flavor. The drinks were only $3 a glass. Peach Bellinis, bloodies, G-Spot, mimosas! I am hooked to brunch. They also serve late night, until 12am! FEZ Im such a fan!"
4,"I had never heard of this place until some friends from out of town brought us a bottle of the olive oil. So when I had out of town company visiting, we made a trip to the Olive Mill and signed up for the tour.  The tour is not really much of a tour, but more of a 20-25 minute lesson on growing and harvesting olives, and then a look at the equipment used to press the oil. Our tour guide was very entertaining and funny. While there was a long period of standing, there is very little walking so really anyone can get their $5 worth. While waiting for the tour to start, we wandered around the store and then enjoyed the wine and cider tasting outside. They also have live music every Saturday.  After the tour we filled several sample cups with a variety of olive oil flavors, and bought a loaf of bread, and enjoyed figuring out what was in each cup. The line to order food was too long, so we didnt stick around for a meal, but everything looked wonderful.  The only less than positive thing I have to say is that they really promoted the Pork Shop down the road, so we went there hoping to load up on ready made food (since we had opted not to wait in line for Olive Mill food). Its actually a butcher shop that also sells a few cooked items. There were BBQ pork burritos, green chili burritos, and spare ribs. The pork burrito was alright, but the sauce overwhelmed the meat so thats all you could really taste.  The ribs were really a disappointment. They are around $6-7 a pound, and although they were meaty, it took way too much work to get the meat off of the bones. Perhaps a few more hours in the oven, and they would have been better - but I dont recommend going out of your way to check this place out."
5,"I am basing this review solely on the Cauliflower Soup. Holy Heaven in a cup. We had Zupas cater lunch at the office, so I cant speak to the actual restaurant. But man, I wish I had a bucket of that soup."
3,"Their food isnt bad, its pretty hard to mess up gyros, rice, salad, and fries.  When it comes to this type of food it really comes down to preference.  For me, I didnt care for this place.  I like crispy fries, their fries are soggy.  I like Beef & Lamb gyros, theirs are Beef only.  I like a mixed green salad with light onion, they serve a shredded romaine salad with heavy onion.  Their prices are fair, portions large, and service friendly, its just not for me.  They did have a lot of sandwiches and burgers that looked good, if thats your thing."
5,"Only 4 stars?  (A few notes: The folks that rated this place low must have been isolated incidences and I feel weigh far to heavy on service rather than product. Dining at a restaurant, rate the service a lil harder, but a coffee shop, hold your tongue.) Anyway, this place rocks. We arent super close, but we pass up several coffee shops en route to Lola because the quality is top drawer. The beans, fair trade, and the roast is perfect. The price of a bag of beans is amazing. Doing right by the farmers and then respecting the product with such a solid roast. This is what is all about! I have yet to find a better americano. A splash of cream and a splenda only augments the flavor of the espresso and the richness really shines. Ive been to most of the independent coffee shops throughout the area, and if I do find myself elsewhere, I can only compare them to Lola, and Lola wins out each time."
4,"To quote my boyfriend, we like this place because ""theyre solid."" Every time we order here, the food is great and fresh. I always get their sweet and sour chicken and I am never disappointed. Instead of chicken chunks coated in batter, this place uses a chicken breast with batter that I would describe to be a thin tempura like batter. There is no excess batter or fat chunks to deal with it. The service is fast and we see the same waiter every time we eat here. This is the my go to place for Chinese food."
4,"Brio is delish, plain and simple. I have yet to get something that isnt tasty. I live about 15-20 miles from one so I dont get out there too often but I do wish there was one closer to my area."
4,Excellent cheap Mexican food that tastes as good as any Mexican restaurant.
1,"After several hundred professional massages over the past 20 years, I encountered today a first -- a massage therapist who explained that she could not do a massage involving any but mild pressure using her hands. It was an issue of ""protecting the thumbs."" When I told her I didnt like forearms and elbows, she explained that shed never worked without using her forearms (and, I assume, her elbows, too). After just five minutes, when I asked for more pressure, she suggested we stop the massage -- that she wasnt the ""therapist for [me]."" She was right. What are they teaching these people these days, and why doesnt an excellent outfit like LifeTime Fitness insist on better skills among its massage staff? I wont offer her name, but, if considering a massage at this establishment, I suggest Casie as the only therapist here worth the money."
4,"This is about as good as it gets for Asian food in this price range.  The chicken isnt chewy like many other inexpensive Asian restaurants.  Ive had several of their dishes and without a doubt the Yakisoba with chicken is my favorite.  I love the white-meat chicken and broccoli (with Teriyaki sauce).  The broccoli is quality, and never overcooked.  And I love their Teriyaki sauce."
5,"Owner Daniel M. is one of my most favorite restaurateurs in Phoenix. His stamina and passion for the business of serving fine cuisine is a rare find. Daniel is from South America but you wouldnt know it; his knowledge of the secret kitchens of Tuscany, Umbria and Amalfi is uncanny. I know this because I traveled with him and his chef one year on their odyssey through Italy. Daniel takes special pride in personally choosing a very select few bottles of wine to fit any budget. OK, its not Etiennes Different Point of Views list of 4000, but know that any choice you make is going to be a good one. If youre not sure, just ask for Daniel and tell him what you have in mind -- likely he has (with a wink) a special bottle in the back. When we traveled through the Italian countryside I was constantly astonished by the warm greetings and special invitations we had from local proprietors who shared with us exquisite homemade wines and dishes made with pride from the finest vegetables and livestock. We frequently stayed long past closing with the owners and into the night sampling rare port and grappa. At one restaurant in Orvieto the owner took us deep into the dank recesses of the wine cellar for a special sampling  of cheese and wine. Talk about knowing people? One afternoon while drinking our 5th bottle of wine, who walks by but Jan DAtri! Wow. (Thats another review.) And speaking of reviewers, I also ran into Phoenix Magazines Nikki Buchanan (also extremely nice). When Daniel first opened in this location with that little stone oven in the corner, it was a pizzeria and guests could belly up to long tables in a casual environment that was made easy by his banter with the heavy Italian accented waitress (name?) who made a comeback some years later. For quite some time the restaurant was Il Forno; that is until corporate giant Il Fornaio entered the fray and sued him to change the name. After much rigmarole he changed to aqua e sale -- and notice Il Fornaio has since closed its doors? LOL. Again after much hoopla, he made it Daniels. The current wood-paneled decor makes me think of a city club in San Fran or London. Very posh, yet understated. Selections of sculpture and art from his travels dot the restaurants three small dining rooms. The menu is a very difficult one. I say that because it has all of your favorites and it is difficult to make your final selection. Great for steak, ravioli, the best carpaccio in the city, best buffala mozzarella, mmm.... I could go on and on. So does the menu, page after page. Some might call the preparations simplistic. This is the Tuscan way. Simple ingredients and simple preparation. Let the ingredients make their own magic. Grilled rack of lamb is not drowned in some Smuckers lime jelly, but gently brushed with rosemary and garlic, tickled with salt and pepper and finished with a squeeze spray of lemon. Unfortunately the artful one-of-a-kind plates and bowls handmade in Vietri chipped at the edges over the years and the health department made him throw them away -- UGH!! -- they were a beautiful motivation to make you lick your plate clean to see the painted pictures beneath your scrumptious dinner. Not that you needed an excuse to dab every last bit of sauce with the wonderful mini loaves of bread cooked right there in the hearth that started it all. Daniel himself is a wonderful host. He loves to give his guests a wonderful experience. There are many choices for Italian food in Phoenix. Most of it is just American Italian. Daniels is a unique touch of the simple yet elegant. Enjoy. P.S. [post edit] OMG. How could I forget the Tiramisu? Its a generous portion, so you can share with your guest, but after your first bite you may not want to. Light and airy, yet fantastically flavorful, the quality of the coffee really makes this dish a reason to go back again and again. Im not going to tell you the secret ingredient. Youll have to ask Daniel."
5,"One of my fave places in Phoenix. Well stocked and friendly staff. I dont normally peruse the DVDs or CDs because they tend to be pricey,but one day I just decided to take a look. Thats when Borders became one of my fave places. I was able to find a fairly rare documentary DVD. I paid 40 bucks for it,but have never seen it offered for sale anywhere before. I very much appreciate a business who refuses to cowtow to the ridiculousness of political correctness. For that alone was well worth paying 40 bucks for. I was even more impressed by the staffer who rang up my purchase for not only being knowledgable about the DVD but letting me know they had a biography of the director of the film that had just come in. Even though the shipment had not been tagged and put on the floor for sale yet,the staffer called to have someone open the box,and bring a copy for me to look at. I bought that too! I will coninue to patronize Borders and any other book store that chooses not to censor!"
1,"I have never been treated so rudely in a retail establishment ever. I went to the shop with my daughter, her friend and my niece...all young adults. I showed a picture of the project we wanted make to the woman working there and she scoffed at me.  I noticed she was playing Solitaire on her iPad...apparently we interrupted her game. She then proceeded to tell us that she would have to open the door and turn on the air conditioner because her mother, the owner of the store, would be back soon and is extremely allergic to fragrance.  The girls and I had body lotion on, this is the desert for crying out loud, and not one of us had perfume on.  Then the mother arrived, there was a brief conversation behind the curtain and she walk out with a towel over her mouth and nose commenting on having to open the door. Seriously? Unfortunately we had picked out some stuff to buy and Im sorry that I spent the $68. I could have spent more but the experience was so distasteful that we hurried out. If I knew how to give less than 1 star, I would. It was unbelievable. I empathize with the woman and her allergies, but the situation could have been handled so much better."
2,"This place was a disappointment.   Im a big fan of a good Italian Beef sandwich.  I was introduced to it when I lived in the Chicago area in 2001.  Since Ive moved back to AZ, I am always in search of a good one.  Lately, on my way to Anaheim for a little family fun, I stop at Portillos in Buena Park or Moreno Valley.  This is a must.  Needless to say this is what I compare Italian Beef sandwiches to. The Italian Beef sandwich at Als just did not compare.  Not only was the beef dry even though I got it wet, but it just tasted different.  It was definitely an unexpected taste for me.  The rest of the family agreed too.  The hype was there but did not deliver or meet my expectations for me. To top it off, the service wasnt the best either.  It took a few times for the cashier to get the order right.  And even though the order was right they still managed to screw up one of the items we ordered.  Though they did rectify it.  And to top it off, we ordered a ""chopped"" salad.  The lettuce wasnt even chopped.  What?  Not chopped?  Its the little things. We ended up leaving disappointed.  It was a bust for us and definitely not worth the trek from Chandler."
2,"Over the last 5 years or so, Ive eaten lunch at Dillys Deli a couple dozen times. The location is excellent, as it is near my office, and the interior décor is clean, modest, and charming. The music seems to vary, but on todays trip, it appeared to be a mix of oldies and jazzy easy listening. While Ive never had to wait for a table to clear, seating can be limited during lunch hours. The service is friendly and quick and the menu offerings plentiful and interesting. Vegetarians will find a handful of options here, though it is likely you can request to omit meat from any sandwich or salad.  Carrying Boars Head ingredients is a plus, however the way their sandwiches are assembled and the ratio of ingredients used simply doesnt work for me. Oftentimes, I find my sandwich has a bulge of deli meat in the center and much less (and sometimes none at all) toward the outer parts nearing the crust. It has been my experience that the wraps are not treated this way, though the only wrap Ive tried (Mexi) lacked flavor and tasted processed.  Ive eaten one salad at Dillys - the Greek - and, while it is tasty, I discovered a dead fly in it halfway through and havent ordered a salad there since.  As other reviewers have reported, the soups arent as piping hot as Id like, though the variety and additional ""daily soup"" is appreciated.  The bread is deliciously soft, warm, flavorful, and large - ideal for accompanying a soup or salad. If youre accustomed to filling up on a sandwich made with normal-sized slices, I suggest ordering a half sandwich so you can sample a side of soup, salad, or dessert as well. All sandwiches are served with a pickle spear. The cookies and brownies get 4 stars on their own. Today I gave Dillys another shot and ordered a new menu item, the Red Bird, on wheat. Personally, Im not a fan. The Blazin Buffalo, Dilly Bird, and Smokey Mountain boast far better flavor combinations, IMO. Also, my pickle spear had a hair on it. Dillys is a bit pricier than its nearby competition (All whole sandwiches are $6.99), though a reasonable price if shared. Overall, this is a higher quality sandwich shop than Subway, Blimpie, and the like. Unfortunately, the fly and hair experiences combined with the bread/meat ratio issue guarantee I will not return."
1,"I have nothing more to add, but I dont want anyone to think only a few people had  complaints about this poorly planned ""festival.""  Oh, wait, I do.  I was there with my 4 year old grand-daughter (and my daughter), since there were going to be kids attractions as well as the food trucks. I thought it was nuts that 3 minutes of jumping around cost $3. But I guess it was consistent with the $4 water and $7 beers. And it would help if there was some roadway controls and/or temporary signage. By 11am, traffic backed up (down) Pima from the event to Indian Bend and over towards the 101. Cars were skipping ahead and cutting into line, further delaying entrance.  If success is measured by interest, the festival was a success. If by performance and customer satisfaction, not so much. And how can a vendor commit to showing and not have enough food to feed the presold ticket holders? Why risk your hard-fought reputation?"
1,"Living in this area I frequent Desert Ridge a lot, and have been to this Macaroni Grill several times... their food is actually pretty good which is why I let the horrible service slide a few times... My friend and I have had experiences such as standing at the host stand with no assistance for several minutes while several employees made eye contact. Of course, no one asked if we had been helped, until the hostess finally made her way back up to the stand and decided to ignore us for another couple of seconds before she even acknowledged us.  Another visit we were seated right away however it took over 15 minutes for our server to come to our table, and that was only after I had to get out of my seat and find one of the employees to ask for our server. I know several people saw us just sitting there, the least they could have done was asked if we had been helped or not.  This last experience, was about a year after the last. I thought maybe they would have changed. I most definitely thought wrong! We were seated promptly and the server was there right away this time. However, our food took FOREVER! Literally, it took over 30 minutes for a medium rare steak and a plate of pasta. I know for a fact they messed something up and ended up taking food out of a to go container and placing it on the plate that they then brought to me (you can see right into their kitchen from the dining room). The server never apologized nor did she come and tell us what the hold up was.  Overall, I will never go to that restaurant again."
3,"Firesky Resort is a marvelous place to unwind and enjoy the warm dry evening air and fire-lit torches.  Whenever I have the opportunity to stay in the Kimpton Hotel Groups locations, I always know Ive made the right choice.  The hotel was beautiful, hip and inviting.   I gave them three stars because the rooms were a nice, but not fabulous, the amenities of Loccitane products definitely helped.  The restaurant Taggio was fine, wasnt spectacular and definitely was the part of the hotel which was least memorable.   The staff was friendly and helpful.  Id stay here again, but with the expectation of enjoying the wonderful pool/cabana area and leaving the resort for dinner.  Scottsdale has so much to offer, what was I thinking...."
2,"Yelp has failed me...I went here based on the reviews I found on here, only to find a restaurant that has fallen off from what it used to be.  I guess this use to be a chef driven restaurant, he created a name for the place. But whatever it is now it has definitely fallen off and definitely not good.  The space is nice enough, I really did not enjoy sitting at the bar and have to look at there dirty kitchen the whole time...But the place does offer a pleasant enough atmosphere.  The food on the other hand was bad. I had the tasting of the appetizers in which everything was overcooked (mushy eggplant) or overcooked and Burnt (anything that had bread like potential) I kinda of wanted to leave after this but I had ordered my Salmon entree from the start...  And now on to the entree which consisted of overcooked salmon, burnt spices on the top, and RAW skin underneath, did not make any since to me. it came with a brick of polenta edible only by the pool of sauce on the plate.  The menu and idea of this restaurant is great, sharp contrasts and bold flavor, but the technique and care is definitely lack here, or maybe they just had a shitty cook that day, I dont know, I just know that I will never make my way back there."
4,"My daughter treated me to a facial here for my birthday. It was lovely and included a massage of my feet and hands. The student was very professional. It normally costs $33 for the signature facial, but was only $25 for my trip since they were running a back to school special for the month of August."
4,"I love that the food was freshly made and the place had a great ""down home"" feel.  The owners are also very welcoming, made us feel like family.  We ordered the Bean Enchiladas, Chicken Enchiladas & Chicken Gorditas.  All came with Rice & Beans.  We all enjoyed our meals.  Good prices also."
5,"Dim lighting. Fleet Foxes. Beautiful upstairs seating that almost seems secret. Band of Horses. Benches that are less cushy than you anticipate them to be. The Shins. Black board specials, just because they look cool. Beirut. $13 vegetable dishes.  Intimidated yet? Fight through the angst. Once you take your first bite of food, all the hullabaloo will be well worth it. Order the forbidden rice bowl. Tell them to make it vegan (the vegetables are usually cooked in a bit of butter)... after all, youre a pseudo-hipster for the evening, and its fantastic. If youre depressed by the idea of black rice as your main carbohydrate, the flat breads are taste-gasmic. That crust... the things Id do for unlimited amounts of that flat bread crust. Top it off with figs and ricotta, and theres no way Im passing up a square or two... or seven. If youre still not sold on the idea of carb-loading, the salmon ""superfood"" is delicious and nutritious, and whos not into a little super(food)iority now and then? But on to the main event... the chocolate stout cake + spiced ice cream + espresso ganache was the best chocolate cake Ive ever had. It was just so damn... moist. There, I said it. Moist. Moist. Moist. Ew. But really, yum. If caffeine, chocolate and alcohol dont suit your fancy (wimp), the cheesecake in a jar was equally delightful. Cookie crust + strawberry compote + cream + cheesecake. Layered. In a jar. Who thought of that? Someone with adorable thoughts, thats who.  And lets be honest, youve earned dessert. I mean... you ordered a healthy, vegan entree over the french onion cheeseburger, right? Right. Of course you did."
4,They are wonderful!
5,"This is a great place to shop, grab a bite, eat dessert, relax, or just hang around. Eat at one of the many excellent restaurants like Christophers, Seasons 52, Black Chili Mexican, and Capitol Grill. Swing by Royal for a cappuccino, iced latte, or your favorite coffee of the day. Savor frozen delight from Haagen Dazs or Mojo Yogurt -- ahhh my sweet Mojo, you and I have been in an on and off relationship for the past year now... by off I mean the 3 or 4 days a week Im NOT there :)  . Movies in the park nights are fun to go to; gasping, laughing, and crying with 200 of your closest (people you probably just met). Get there early for good seats, (about 30 min or more), otherwise youll be stuck behind a tree or some tall guy you cant see around. Be sure to bring a lawn chair along or a blanket to throw down if youll be attending one of these events. The shopping is top notch - but be sure to bring your wallet. Most shops here will cost you at least your first born child, or an equivalent value. Happy shopping to all my yelping buddies!"
4,"I  frequent this joint often to relax outside on the patio and drink wine and/or beer.  The service here is outstanding.  My vegan friend particularly likes this place because they make her vegan friendly pizza.  As a carnivour I love their italian sausage.  And for all you cheese lovers their mozerella is made fresh daily!  I am more of a beer fan than a wine person so it is worth mentioning they have an extensive beer list, including quite a few beers on tap. The sign above the patio says Patio and Wine Bar, so it can be easy to miss if you are looking for the full name on the sign."
5,"I Love Lolos Chicken and Waffles and you will too!  Recently my fiancé and I went to Lolos. I had heard about Lolos and Mrs. Whites for years, but never took the time to go to the Phoenix locations. When this south Scottsdale location opened, I made it a point to go and try the food.  The food is excellent or in my best Brooklyn accent ""Forget about it"". But dont forget about it, the MAC-N-CHEESE is a most try. The chicken is FANTABULOUS, the COLLARD GREENS are on point and they serve Kool Aid. Yes I said Kool Aid. I must have had a gallon of GRAPE KOOL AID. Before this, the last time I had Kool Aid was 1968.  This place is very popular, so you may have to wait for a table, but it is well worth it. This place is so popular that Sports, Music, Acting and Reality celebrities can be seen here regularly. When we were there we saw the rapper Biz Markie. He did the song ""Just a Friend"" back in 1990.   The only down side - although the service was generally good, it gets so busy that at times the server may get distracted and may not come back to you as timely or often as you may like.  BOTTOM LINE, I LEFT FULL, HAPPY AND WITH A KOOL AID SMILE. TRY IT YOU WILL LIKE IT"
5,"This place is still open, but the name has been changed to Juba, and it is under new ownership. Same spot though, and the food has pretty much stayed the same besides a few changes in the menu.  Anyway, I absolutely love coming here. My friend, Molly, is one of the servers, and I love her for introducing me to Ethiopian cuisine. Its definitely a very interesting blend of flavors, but now I come here about once or twice a week and stuff my face. I recommend trying both the vegan combo and the pita sandwich with chicken or falafel. The coffee drinks are delicious too and since theyre made with Ethiopian coffee, the taste is very unique.  If youve been hesitant about trying Ethiopian food, just get over it and go try the food at Juba. You wont be disappointed!"
2,"I was severely disappointed by my experience at Five Guys.  With all the hype that this chain has garnered, I found that little of it held up.  As soon as I walked in the door I was overwhelmed by the smell of smoke that the griddle was wafting through the restaurant.  There were plenty of people cooking and preparing the food, yet it all looked chaotic and unorganized. Just as other people have mentioned, you can choose a whole array of toppings to customize your burger.  That capability is great as long as the cashier rings up your order correctly (which mine was not).  Needless to say I was less than thrilled that I had to battle the smoke so that I could re-explain to the counter staff how my meal was supposed to be prepared.  Along with my burger, I also ordered the regular-sized Cajun fries.  These were definitely fully-seasoned, so if you are averse to spice dont order them.  The regular order of fries turned out to be a modest cup of fries stuffed in a brown bag full of more fries.  It is almost as if Five Guys strategy is to overwhelm you by their generosity with their fries, so that you forget that their burger is mediocre and their fries are sopping wet with grease.   The AYCE peanuts were good though; it is a shame that these were the highlight of the meal."
4,"I really enjoy this course but I am saving the 5 out of 5s for the Troons, Grayhawks and WeKoPas of the world.  Nonetheless, this is a great, very challenging course and you dont have to drive waaaay up north or east of Scottsdale to get there, which is always a great plus.  I remember Golf Digest did a list of Top 25 College Courses and this didnt make it, which I thought was nuts.  My only complaint is that the course isnt really as luxurious as the peak season rate would indicate.  Also, as the other guys who reviewed this mentioned, there is some fantastic ASU swag available in the shop if you are a fan, they probably have every variety you could ever imagine.  Havent eaten there but Teds Hot Dogs is close enough that youd be crazy not to go there after your round."
3,"The food was excellent ... the service not so much.  A colleague and I took one of my clients here for a business dinner. The atmosphere was great, the food was outstanding but the service was embarrassing.  It was a fun, Arizona type feeling restaurant and made quite the difference for my clients who are originally from Scotland.  I had the roasted shrimp and grits. The grits were the best I have ever had (sorry North Carolina!). The shrimp portion was amazing. The dessert was great. I was surprised to see the offering of huckleberries.  Sadly, the server forgot quite a bit of things. My clients wife ordered a second glass of wine to have for dinner, which was forgotten. We also asked for corn bread - the server forgot and brought it with our dessert. He tried to explain that it is made fresh to order and that is why it took so long."
5,"Nearly 3 years after a Waikiki vacation, my longing for a Puka dog has been satisfied. Maui Dog is not exactly the same, nor should it be, but it has the same awesome concept, plus more! Ive been here twice, once had a beef dog, the other a turkey dog. Both with mild garlic mayo & pineapple. These suckers are huge! And messy! And delicious! The dog has good flavor, mixed with the slightly sweet bun, spicy mayo and sweet pineapple...perfect! I think it would have been a better eating experience if my order was not to-go. The mess these things make all wrapped up is not pretty, but that absolutely does not deter from the taste. I cant wait till I have the time to eat-in and try the rest of their tasty-sounding menu!"
4,"I finally made it out to the Rokerijs infamous happy hour and it didnt disappoint. My girlfriend and I had a couple of the small plates, the mushroom toast and stuffed mushrooms (both amazing! but I REALLY loved the mushroom toast) and some wine. The inside is really unique to Arizona and completely relaxing. Our server Eric was super nice and chatted with us a lot about the restaurant and the menu.  We will definitely be back for half priced bottles of wine and happy hour very soon!"
5,"Like Sex or Tobacco? Hells yeah!!!! were not looking for vanilla yes here, this place pulls out all the stops If  Ichi Yakaguru the new york club promoter and 9yo Japanese pimp needed anything, it could be found here. The best selection of DVDs and printed material i have come by in awhile... lots of Toys so much stuff a lot of it is hung above the head, so look up. Lingerie, Tobacco, Human Fire Hydrants, Hobos with Soap Sud Beards"
4,"Had to go to Gila Bend for something and while we were there decided to stop and get something to eat.  Stopped at this restaurant and were glad we did.  We ordered the large meat lovers calzone and wings to split.  The pizza dough they use for the crust is very good.  Nice flavor, slight crispness and not doughy.  Im very particular about my wings and when I verified that they fried their wings we ordered some and we were pleased with them as well.  They made them as we requested, slightly crispy, because theres nothing worse than a soggy skinned wing thats like chewing on a piece of rubber.  Our server, cant recall her name, was very friendly and always checking back with us to see if we needed anything.   There was a group of men a couple of tables away that ordered pizza that looked awesome.  Another table ordered spaghetti with meat sauce and what I think was a very large looking burger with fries, which they had the same idea as us, split to share.  The serving of spaghetti with meat sauce was a nice size serving as well.  Another patron ordered dessert which, according to the server, was a spimoni cake.  It looked really good too.   If you are ever going thru or visiting Gila Bend for any reason, I would suggest that you stop here."
5,"I ordered my custom made door and it arrived recently for installation. The design was exactly to specifications, quality of construction and the finish are flawless. It took several months to get but it was worth it. This one improvement has increased the value of my home and makes my entire family feel safer."
3,"Minnie and I stopped by Papago Dog Park today on a whim...  It was a beautiful day and since she was such a good girl in the car with me and at my afternoon meeting, I wanted to reward her.  Rather than travel out of our way to go to Chaparral Dog Park (our usual dog park destination), I remembered seeing this place, specifically the fenced in / off-leash area, and we swung by. It was just after 4pm, and there were a handful of dogs there, and more were coming the longer we stayed.  Its a lot smaller than Chaparral, and the grass is not the healthiest Ive seen... Unfortunately, there were several areas that owners didnt clean up after their pooches too.  (Come on, owners, you give the rest of us a bad name!) Anyways, we had a nice 30 minute visit... Minnie sniffed out a few other dogs from behind and then they returned the favor to her.  Dont you love how they socialize with each other?!  Too cute. Anyways, will this become our dog park of choice? No. Is this a viable option if youre in the area? 100%."
5,Have eaten here several times.  Always amazing.
2,"Lost baggage and poor child wrangling. Its all about employee empowerment. I have the patience of the Madonna - all right maybe more like the Material Girl - but I am pretty laid back. After my humbling experience in the wine industry, Ive been much more appreciative of service industry related jobs. But when employees are not empowered to answer the most simple of questions, and were checking in on machines with nobody around to handle luggage, well...its a disaster waiting to happen. Its an unfortunate thing that is supposed to help in keeping costs down and help with efficiency - but theres been consistent problems with all of my US AIRWAYS flights. Lets throw JFK airport into the mix to help maximize the disaster...we ended up in Orlando. Waiting for our luggage. Luckily our toddler was entertained with the luggage roundabout...because we waited through two flight arrivals to retrieve one bag.  Family that met up with us for the 4th assured us US AIRWAYS used a really efficient delivery service...Apparently the lost luggage situation is pretty common. Good thing the baby bug is a trooper when it comes to traveling - because Orlando trips tend to be family-heavy and the on-board US AIRWAYS staff consistently doesnt seem too thrilled to be dealing with even the well-behaved ones."
5,We were shopping at the Bass Pro Shop in Tempe and decided to go for ice cream to kill some time before dropping my parents off at the airport. I pulled out my iPad and yelped ice cream. It brought up 4 options in the area and we chose Dairy Queen which was a few blocks away. As luck would have it there was no left turn onto Dobson and we ended up going East on the 202 the opposite direction of the Dairy Queen.  So I searched again and we came up with Yogurtland.  It wasnt luck after all but some ice cream higher power at work to bring us to our frozen yogurt oasis in Yogurtland.  Not only were the ingredients fresh and delicious but the price was reasonable as well. 5 of us each had a scrumptious & generously portioned sundae and our total bill was less than $20! We all enjoyed our selections.  One topping surprise was the Fruit Pebbles cereal my daughter put on her sundae.  The fruity crunch they added was delish!   Yogurtland was a home run!  Thanks For the Yelp!
5,"I recommend this to everyone.  I have never had a bad meal here.  Inexpensive, great service, off the beaten path. Love this place."
4,"Ive been meaning to Yelp for a looong time now, and after having brunch at Scramble today, I thought it only fitting that I give them my Yelp virginity. My boyfriend and I arrived around 1pm and it was pretty quiet. There was a young lady at the counter, taking orders, and another stocking juices nearby. Both were very friendly.  I requested a vegan menu (the vegan options didnt seem to be listed on the large menu near the door), which was quickly furnished to me. There were 2 tofu scrambles, a soy chorizo breakfast burrito and french toast as possible choices. I couldnt decide between the veggie scramble or the french toast, so... I ordered both! My boyfriend went with the bacon and mushroom omelet (off the regular menu). We were offered bread options of white, wheat, rye, or an english muffin. The side dishes were fruit or sweet potato hash... and I think a lot of the menu items come with rosemary potatoes, but we both opted for the hash. The cashier gave us our number. It was a beautiful day, so we found a table outside. In a matter of very few minutes, our food had arrived. I noticed that the vegan items were on red plates to differentiate them. My scramble was yummy, with a good enough amount of veggies in it, and a bit more wet than most other scrambles Ive had. I did find myself wishing the portion was a bit larger.  The order of french toast came with 3 good-sized pieces and was super duper good. The highlight for me, was the amazing sweet potato hash! Its served in a patty and is chock full of onions, zucchini, carrots (I think) and seasoned with rosemary. Ive never had anything like it. I highly recommend it. My boyfriend did seem to enjoy his omelet and definitely agreed with me on the hash. Scramble is a great place, especially considering their vegan breakfast options, which are far too few-and-far-between in the valley. We will absolutely be back!"
5,"This is the largest urban park. Moreover, that urban part is great because I am 10-30 minutes from three major trailhead areas.  For hiking I like many points of entry, one of my favorites is telegraph pass, this is on the south side of the mountain. A new recently remolded parking lot is found on desert foothills parkway. There is a paved path that is about 1/2 a mile and at its end Telegraph pass is to the left and Desert classic is to the right. Telegraph pass grows in steepness towards the top where there are some larger stairs. At the top, there is a bench and you can then continue on National trail. If you head west, you can reach a great Ramada. From the pima canyon entrance I take the fire road to national, after the initial ascent it is just some rolling hills, I then make left to hidden valley where there is a great natural tunnel, Follow this trail to reach fat mans pass, contrary to the name there is a narrow gap that fat men cannot pass luckily you can go around, this meets back up with national trail. Many unique rock formations on this hike.  For shorter easier hikes from this lot, you can do the east and west loops and Beverly canyon all small trails that loop, and have a few nice views. For Mountain biking my skills are not too advanced so I stick to the east end of desert classic, with mostly straight section and a few wash passes and slight hill inclines its great for a novice rider."
2,"After waiting for over a month for this place to open, constantly annoyed by the sign on the door stating, ""Training in Progress"" I was expecting something spectacular.  The name itself ""Revo Burrito, Revolutionary Mex"" set me up thinking I was walking into...a revolutionary burrito joint!  My husband and I were disappointed to say the least.  He had the Chicken Machaca Burrito, which the counter girl said was her favorite.  And it was, well, just a chicken burrito, at best.  There was so much liquid oozing out the bottom from the wet lettuce and wet pico that he had to move his chips to another plate because they were swimming.  I had the Black Bean Burrito.  The menu had stated the beans were slow simmered in garlic, onions & seasonings...sounded delish!  However it tasted like they walked next door to Safeway and bought a can of black beans, heated them up and rolled them into a tortilla.  It was also supposed to include their ""special cheese blend"" AND there was only a SLIGHT SPRINKLE of cheese...literally!  I actually opened up the tortilla to make sure they didnt forget it.  Call me crazy, but when I order a bean & CHEESE burrito, Id like to have at least a small amount of cheese.  I guess their idea of special cheese is magical, disappearing cheese. The rice with corn & a drizzle of cream was especially delicious & the fresh-squeezed lemonade was tart & perfectly sweetened. We also liked the decor & the windowed kitchen. For the price you pay for a very, simple burrito, that offers nothing revolutionary about it, their menu is over priced.  I would rather go to Baja Fresh or any other neighborhood Mexican restaurant."
2,"Good price for the location;however its definitely outdated and appliances are extremely old.. Maintenance people fix things quick but some fixes are sub par.. My neighbor and good friend continue to have water intrusion in there home when it rains hard. They have to have their carpet padding replaced multiple times because of water coming in from under the building. I work for a property management company myself and this half fixed issue is something that Im not impressed with.  Also, every year they increase rent, they dont work with you on price and dont seem to care about good paying tenants (Like myself). They are too corporate and only care about the money and not the longevity of good on time paying tenancy.. The only reasons I stay is because the location and price is good, but also because I hate moving around. I anticipate that rent will continue to go up and well over what other nearing apartments properties have to offer. This would mean that I probably have only another year or two left before rents over $1000 for a two bedroom...  One good thing is that the staff is nice and friendly but supposedly Equity Residential (managing/owning company) doesnt give their property managers enough power to work with their tenants. Its unfortunate really because I would imagine that companies would rather have long term on time paying tenants and negotiate on rental amounts and try to weed out the consistent late or non paying tenants.  Keep in mind that no utilities are included.. Hope to see some change in Equity Residential but because of how corporate they are, I highly dont think that this will happen.."
4,Had the super burger and fries tonight... excellent!  I like that while they do have some tvs on with sports on them... the house music takes front stage.  Might be different on big playoff nights. Also... the tequila thyme drink... delicious and actually had some  alchyhol in it!  Fantastic!
5,"I have been visiting Mrs. Whites going on 30 years, but after looking up the phone number this afternoon to verify if they were open and still had fried chicken, my wife started reading some of the reviews following a recent Food Network recommendation - I almost got cold feet. Good thing I didnt. The food is as awesome as ever. The service is much as it has always been. Be forewarned, trendy restaurant goers, who glom onto TV reviews, Mrs. Whites is not trendy; there are no bubbly fresh blonde girls waiting to seat you. The service is matter of fact, no goofing around, you must get to the business of ordering and pretend you know what you are doing - this is the way it has always been at Mrs. Whites. If you are looking for others to pamper you, this is not the place for that. Mrs. Whites is where you go to pamper your indulgence for perfect soul food. If you want Scottsdale ambiance, again, this joint wont work for you. When you go, be prepared that not all dishes may be on the menu during your visit. There are no corporate owned semi-trailers that deliver two tons of food every other day. This is a small and very cramped operation that makes homemade food for those who know how to appreciate it. In these days of flash frozen prepared dishes that are uniform from visit to visit at chain restaurants, this food is made in a tiny hot kitchen. If they run out of your favorite dish that has been cooking for hours prior to your arrival, there is no way they can whip up another pot of green beans and potatoes in 20 minutes.  I often call ahead to verify if they have what I want because years ago it was not uncommon that by 12:30 they would be out of half of everything on the menu, which was OK because if forced me to try new things Back then, Mrs. Whites was open Monday through Friday from 11:00 till 3:00, but Id swear youd be lucky to get anything after 1:00 - and that was perfectly fine as you knew they were doing all they could with their limited space to do their best for us customers. Id just come back on another day.  To say I have the utmost respect for the White family would be an understatement, today I was afraid I might have to lose that based on those poor reviews below. I do not believe those reviews are an accurate representation of The Golden Rule Cafe. They are the distortions and disappointments of people who have skewed expectations. Funky little hole-in-the-wall family-run operations that attract a loyal customer base may not be the place for everyone, but if you understand that wonderful stuff doesnt always come wrapped in a sterile designer package, then you might get along with Mrs. Whites. I love this place and hope I always will."
4,"Loved the location at atmosphere of this place!  Had a very nice business dinner here last night.  We were able to sit outside thanks to the gorgeous weather, and Id recommend this to anyone.  The houses inside have their charm, but al fresco dining is great!   We had a few drinks at the bar before we started dinner - they have a fairly nice wine by the glass list, as well as a nice stocked bar.  Something for everyone! The menu contained lots of delicious choices, and it was hard to choose.  Ended up going with Hapuku, which was a new-to-me fish from New Zealand, similar to grouper.  It was delicious - tender, flaky, and the earthy vegetables with it were a nice complement. We had very polite service, though not well-timed.  I like when plates are cleared all at once for people, instead of taking plates at the table away when others are eating.  OR, bringing the bill before weve finished dessert.  Both of these happened here."
5,"*** I gave this 5 stars based on the best Mexican food Ive had in AZ, not based on white linen and waiter service, just an fyi*** I wont write too much as it seems that everyone already has. Both locations are GREAT. Some of the best ""homestyle"" Mexican Ive ever had. I usually get the double wrapped enchilada combo that is pure saucy heaven! A great place to call ahead on a friday night when youre exhausted from work and not doing jack, pick up your food, pick up a six pack of Pacifico and head on home. Happiness is a sure bet!"
5,Every time I visit Arizona I love to eat here to food is vary good and I have my wife to thank for turning me on too this restaurant I wish they would have some in Georgia
5,"All I have to say is WOW! This place is EXCELLENT!   All the dishes we had were extremely fresh, authentic, and DELICIOUS!   My favorite pot stickers EVER.  The skin is super thin, tender, not greasy, mostly steamed encased around a very light, delicate dumpling that makes me want to order 2 next time. 6 is just not enough, they are tiny, but oh so delectable! The sauce is perfectly balanced of sweet, spicy, and tangy and does not overpower the pot sticker.  It also comes with a thin airy, crispy (rice chip?) underneath the pot stickers that give it an extra texture with scallions scattered about.  MMMMMMmmmmm. The green curry is more brothy than others than others that I have had, but no matter...It is delicious with bits of vegetable, and whatever meat you prefer..we got chicken.  I love sopping it up with rice and trying to eat it with chopsticks.  You may need a spoon :)  The eggplant and chicken stir fry is also fabulous.  The asian eggplants are cooked to perfection. Their sauces are spot on.   BEST Coconut ice cream!  It is light, fluffy, icy, dreamy, pea-nutty, coconut cloud confection that makes my mouth water!  It is not sickly sweet sticky artificial coconut tasting at all...Predominant coconut flavor is not my favorite and I LOVE THIS!  Even if you dont like curries, there is plenty of food here that will make you a fan!  This is a mom and pop kind of place, they are really nice.  Its a trek for us, but definitely worth the drive!"
4,"I have been to this restaurant a couple of times and I always leave happy and satisfied. I love coming here for the view as it reminds me of home.   We came here once again for a special occasion which was a farewell dinner for my mom who was visiting from South Africa. I had made a reservation using Opentable and asked for a nice view as a treat to my mom on her final night.   The hostess reserved us a table with a splendid an unrestricted view. We had a very attentive waiter - Luis - who treated us with colorful and informative descriptions of the menu. He also took care of us with an exquisite after dinner treat seeing as how mom was leaving.   The dinner was exceptional - as always, so was the atmosphere, the company and the wine. Do go here!   I suggest arriving a little before the dinner reservation to enjoy drinks on the patio while watching the sunset...always a treat! Call ahead of time to find out whether the patio will be open - it has happened to me twice that it was reserved for private functions. (Which was totally my bad - but maybe someone else can benefit from it.)"
4,"Their sandwiches are excellent! I like to get the slider trio with bbq chicken, brisket, and pulled pork. Their potato salad is pretty decent but not as good as grandmas ;). Also, their coleslaw is quite nice but just a touch of too much mayo. Now comes the bad part: the ribs. I absolutely love bbq ribs and unfortunately theirs were dry with very little meat on the bone. I would not recommend the ribs here to anyone. Stick with the sammys and youll be all good."
4,"I loved the crispy crust of the pizza thought it was super good.  I think if you havent been there and are at the San Tan Mall shopping that its worth a visit.  We went on a double date and it was a pretty good experience.  The only issue I had was that I thought they had a very small dining area, which was probably the reason for the 45min wait.  Also we went on a friday night and probably because of the small area it got very loud, which I know the management has no control over, but just an fyi of my experience.  Id say if you havent been and you love pizza its worth the visit.   I may try and stop in for lunch sometime but definitely not on a Friday night, it was just too busy."
3,"Ive been here for a couple of happy hours. I agree with Charles R - no need to pay full price (especially as the regular prices are a bit hight) and it is better than Ra. Definitely not the best sushi Ive had in town, but the drinks are good (cucumber mojito!) and the place is set up well for happy hour groups. The servers I have encountered are all VERY patient with people coming and going within the group and individual checks for everyone.  Knowing what a pain that is, I really appreciate how willingly they do it. For good sushi, I will stick with Yasu or Sakana.  For happy hour, this is a great place - and the Tempe Marketplace location is convenient to several friends."
1,"$8 for a tiny sandwich with one egg, two greasy strips of bacon, and a stale muffin. They say its pricy because they get it local? It has to have substance to be considered anything. So whack."
4,I was so excited to visit The new Postino in Gilbert!!! I love and frequent the original but this new location is much closer to my house. Bruschetta is amazing!!! Love the atmosphere and staff too. Wine selection rocks!!! Great Happy hour prices!!! Highly recommend a visit!
4,"Like the other reviewers have said the service is really not that great.  Luckily theyre saved the  really good food that they have.  We ordered so much food that our little two top table  couldnt possibly handle it all.  The mussels  might have been the best Ive ever had. We also shared a Frito misto, which is really good except theyre pretty chintzy with the shrimp they only gave us too.  The pastas were clearly handmade which appreciate and theyre quite good. The owner came over to check on us a couple times which I appreciated.  Im definitely coming back soon."
4,"#26, #1, #150 is my favorite. I go here every time I need something warm in my belly. They are open early too! I love this place and the dining area has gotten bigger :) Had the Bun bo hue. Was pretty good and cheap!"
5,"Do you like trendy shit-music and half dressed plastic surgery queens gyrating all around you, while you pay twelve dollars for your appletini? If your answer is yes, dont bother coming here.  Dive bars are plentiful in Phoenix, but the Bikini is in my hood. Its a dirty, unassuming place, with a couple of no-nonsense bartenders and a good jukebox.  There are a couple of rules to follow when visiting the Bikini:  1. Bring cash. Cards arent accepted, the atm machine is there for decoration only, as it hasnt worked in at least two years.  2. Dont make fun of the guy in the overalls and farmer hat. Hes my neighbor.  3. Dont piss off the bartenders. Tip them well, treat them nicely, and dont order more than three dirty martinis. If you are nice to them, they will be nice to you. This includes, but is not limited to: the strength of your drinks, the price of your drinks, and whether or not you get a drink at all. They take no shit.  If you cant handle it, stay away. The place gets crowded enough as it is."
2,"2 stars because I really did like the eye doctor I saw, she was awsome.   Thought I was off to a good start getting new glasses.  I picked out my frames while I waited to be taken care of.   Oh...wait...the eye glass gods had something else in store for me.   The person helping me couldnt get an authorization code from my insurance company because it was afterhours.  He actually told me I had to pay full price or come back tomorrow.  Now keep in mind that I have had this insurance forever, never had any problems before; after hours, weekends, etc.  So I used my cell and called the insurance company.  I get someone on the phone who is trying to help us.  I put eyemaster guy on the phone and he actually got into a fight with the woman on the phone, handed it back to me and said here you talk to her, Im done.   So the lady got me the authorization code and a explaination that this doesnt happen because most eye glass providers can take care of everything in spite of the insurance company being closed and she also asked me if I was sure I shouldnt switch eyemaster locations due to this guys behavior.   But I thought I was done.  I have my glasses picked out and I needed them to drive.  So while she was talking to me the guy at eyemasters was throwing out insults loud enough that the lady could hear.   So I lost 1/2 hour of my time and think the worst is over Well...those darn eye glass gods...I cant get them in an hour because it was too late in the day the guy tells me.  He has the right lens and it was only 6:00 pm,  come back tomorrow.   So I called today and was told 1/2 hour and they will be ready.  I drive over there on my lunch hour and guess what.  They arent even close to being ready.  So I walk around the mall, come back and guess what, only 1 pair is ready.  That would normally be ok but the attitude of the two guys working is arrogant and not very customer friendly.  I laugh it off and leave.   So what are the odds Ill get my glasses after work today???  One can only wonder.  Awful service, unprofessional and unpleasant to experience."
4,"How can I not show yelp love for the original fro yo shop that kept my addiction fulfilled in the early days of the fro yo phenomenon? Yes, that is what Golden Spoon is to me.  When I first moved to Phoenix from college, I was coming from an area that was overloaded with frozen yogurt shops for the college girls who shared my love of the frozen treat. Unfortunately, Phoenix hadnt quite yet jumped on the bandwagon and so the only choice was Golden Spoon. To make matters worse, the only locations were north on Shea or South in Awatukee. So, since I was living in Old Town, the Shea location was typically my choice.  I can say that I added several miles on my car very willingly to treat my taste buds to Golden Spoon. Yes, it was the closest shop to me but its also creamy and completely delicious. The frozen yogurt is served by staff and comes in different sizes. You can choose from multiple toppings and its just your ""old fashioned"" frozen yogurt shop. Im using old fashioned very loosely in this sense, since frozen yogurt is anything but old fashioned, but with the self-serf trend, Golden Spoon is ""old fashioned"" compared to that.  I dont visit Golden Spoon as often as Id like anymore because it is still a bit of a drive, but anytime Im in the area, I know just exactly where to stop for a sweet frozen treat!"
5,"Loves the recent Cezanne show. In fact Ive seen it twice in the last week. I need to find out more about who curated the exhibit as it is very fine. The Oriental collection is very nice and soothing.  The Downtown Chamber Group gave a wonderful concert in the great hall on Sunday. I wonderful and unusual program of saxophone and harp. I think it is great to have music in the galleries. I liked the musicians being on a platform. since the room isnt banked one can see the performers. A few things Im not so crazy about: The great room is this awesome space for large art. Sunday I sat and looked at it for several hours. You know, not such great art. I find the Terrill boring and the other pieces uninteresting. The cafe never quite lives up to its promise. My lunch companion barley touched her lunch and the waiter never asked why or offered a box. Enough grousing I love the place and go often."
5,A great restaurant staff! They go above and beyond for their customer. Try the buffet you will not be disappointed. Bacon is cooked to perfection. Fruit is fresh and the seating is perfect for large groups.
4,"Well it was St. Patricks day and I could not think of anywhere to go but here, that might be celebrating. Oh the were definately into it up in here! haha patrons and staff were both decked out for the day in green and with hats, tee-shirts, plastic jewlery and just about anything you can find related to the day.The crowd was happy and I talked to a lot more people than on the average stop in. The dining room and bar were both filled. The Irish music was filling the place, the green beer was flowing as one might expect at a discounted rate. There was a corn beef & cabbage plate special being offered up as well as the usual menu items and the Wed .40 cent wing deal they now have started. There was St Paddys day decoration and give aways from happy hour into the evening. A fun and lively pub it was. My only complaint was that drinks were all being served in limp little plastic cups; mixed drinks and the beer."
5,"I work next door, and I love her ! She has done an excellent job of slim fitting my baggy shirts !!  Well she did ask me if I was gay but then hey, given how animated I get about clothes I dont blame her for askin ! My SO found this rather amusing and laughed her head off... oh well getting back to my review.  I love nadya cuz she does a wonderful job, each time. She knows when the darts will give the slimming effect and when the sides are to be taken in. Its never too tight and never too lose, and she always always delivers on time.   I have been here atleast 10 times !! Trust me my metrosexuality wouldnt let me let me go back if it wasnt a five star service!!"
5,"Located in the space formerly occupied by LGOs short lived Radio Milano, the north side of Campbell has been reincarnated as the Arcadia Room, a private dining facility operated by the aforementioned restaurant group. I dined here recently for the hubbys work dinner. Unlike so many private facilites that feel like a corporate conference room, the Arcadia Room is a cool, casual, restaurant - all to your self. We had about 60 in our group, and had plenty of room to mingle at the sleek bar lining one side of the room, or gather by the open kitchen.The weather was blazing hot when we were there, but there is even a lovely little patio outdoors for guests. I think this would be an ideal location for any work or social occasion where you want an intimate atmosphere combined with reputable fare."
4,"A comfortable little wine shop situated just south of Old Town Scottsdale.  Every Thursday they bring in a distributor or vintner to showcase a set of wines at their bar and collection of tables set off to the side.  For $15 you usually taste five or six wines of decent quality, the best part to the price is that $10 of each tasting goes into purchasing a bottle of one of the wines tasted. The atmosphere is quite an eclectic mix of high-brow, with food and clientele from Atlas Bistro migrating in, and casual.  The people running the place couldnt be more nice or more knowledgable in the wines they sell either.  The prices may be a touch above somewhere like BevMo, but if youre looking for the perfect wine to go with gnocchi in a basil cream sauce, these are the guys to ask!"
2,"I went to Sutra to attend the mixer where Yelp was being featured. After soaking in the cool ""sceney"" vibe, I decided that I was hungry. I asked the waitress for a menu. When she came back she told me that the right hand side of the menu was half off and made a couple suggestions. I love the names of the rolls that Sutra has. There were selections like ""Cougar"" and ""30k millionaire"". I had one of each. As if the rolls were made to live up to their namesakes, they didnt impress me; they merely annoyed me. The lack of freshness and flavor were the biggest factors in Sutras failure. I ended up leaving plenty of sushi on my plate, but I was relieved that they were half off, otherwise I would have returned them upon first bite.  I would not eat at Sutra again if I had a choice. I would advise you to eat elsewhere and come to Sutra to see and be ""scene""!"
2,"I heard nothing but praise about the food and atmosphere of this chain restaurant.  I loved the look of this place inside and out. Great rustic barrels and old barber chairs in the bar area gave a unique look. Service was friendly and fast.  Food was less than desirable. Salad was nothing but iceberg lettuce (and I got a stump) with some shredded red cabbage. My pasta dish was spaghetti with a white clam sauce. It was too salty and there was a sprinkling of microscopic clam bits.  I always take leftovers home, this time I didnt. While the prices are good its not worth a less than average meal. Husband was equally disappointed with his chicken marsala. Chances of going back are slim to none."
4,"The burgers and fries here are pretty good, but the custard sundaes and concret mixers are amazing. The PBC & B i will go back for over and over again as well as try the other items. Great place."
4,"Good food, friendly people. We like the Gold Strike Burger -- we get it almost every time. Also try the shrimp appetizer and the bread pudding dessert. Appetizer and dessert, plus a Kiltlifter Beer or two, is sometimes all you need.  The only sad thing is, because they are a bit off the beaten track, they will have to close for the summer, until November. We will miss them until then."
2,"Walking in to Five Guys, I was rather excited, and was looking forward to my experience. I have never been to a Five Guys before, so this was something new. My first reaction upon opening the doors was the music was blaring. Too loud, at least. The music was classic rock, which I dont mind. After walking up and reviewing the easily understood menu and waiting in line for a few minutes, someone took our order. The order taker seemed like she was having a long day, not seeming very interested in the customer. While taking the order, one could clearly see the kitchen. It seemed kind of like In-N-Out, but everyone was moving much slower. It was as if everyone was moving in slow motion. Much to my dismay, they did not offer Dr. Pepper, my favorite soft drink. I was surprised that they offered other lesser known drinks, but not Dr. Pepper? Come on. After waiting about 6 or 7 minutes, my food arrived in a bag. A bag? Really? I was planning on eating inside, not take out. Even McDonalds does better than that. Digging through the bag I first took out the fries, which were in a cup, and I took a bite. My first impression of the fries was they were nothing special, and too salty. I like salt on my fries as it adds flavor, but there was simply too much salt. As a result, in addition to the fact that the serving was quite large, I finished only about half of my fries. Now onto the burger. I paid about $10 for my meal, so I was thinking to myself that this better be the best burger I have ever tasted in a long time. Unwrapping the product in its tin foil wrapping, I noticed that the presentation of the burger was sub par. The burger did not look appetizing, at all. Almost disgusting, as a matter of fact. The cheese was dripping over the bun, and I couldnt even see all the ingredients on the burger. Taking my first bite, it didnt taste bad. A pretty classic American burger taste, I must say. It did taste rather close to Wendys.  Upon finishing my meal, I was not impressed. My stomach felt greasy, and I felt the need to go hike a mountain a couple times, which I did, as Tempe Butte is close by. I felt my stomach almost on the point of rejecting it, it was that greasy. Seriously. Overall, Five Guys is way to expensive, unbelievably greasy, and makes your stomach cringe. The atmosphere is nice though, thus the two stars.  If you had to choose between Five Guys and In-N-Out, INO is the clear winner in every category."
3,"The restaurant has 6 tables which make it possible for you to eat-in, but this place is definitely more suited towards take out or delivery.  Just dont expect service if you eat-in.  You order at a counter and if you choose to eat-in, you will get your soup in a take out container, eat on paper plates and styrofoam cups, but get your entrees served on platters. The house special won ton soup was pretty tasty and was loaded with a variety of fresh veggies, as well as chicken, pork, and shrimp pieces.  However, one key ingredient was missing - won tons! General Tsos chicken was fried and served with broccoli and sufficient sauce.  The Mongolian beef was more Mongolian and less beef. Overall the food was OK, except for the disappointment of the missing wontons, and I would probably consider this place again for delivery."
2,"Best beer selection in Arizona but the good features end there.  Its the only reason I return and put up with the following.  Service is often horrible, even during the day when there are few patrons.  Often you have to go up to the bar to order even when there is a server in your section.  It makes no sense that a mug of beer should be empty for more than 10 minutes before it is noticed. Food is subpar and wouldnt get such a pass from most people if this place didnt have the beer.  Prices are reasonable.  Website is often inaccurate re: what is actually on tap."
5,"My boyfriend and I stopped by to grab a bite to eat before work and long story short -Greeted immediately  -Lots of variety -Meat lovers pizza is amazing -Ask for Tawnya shes really nice and a wonderful server  -Will be back, loved the excellent service!!"
4,"This is one of Scottsdales new hot spots. If you like the Scottsdale scene, this place is a must. Sunday the music goes off as Thomas James spins sic house beats and the bar serves up $2 tacos. On the weekends, it is still the hot new local spot so it is always busy. Fun place to go and usually there is great eye candy."
4,"Upon first glance this is appears to be a very usual strip mall type bar but behind the black glass lies a more unusual bar and grill. We went on a Sunday for the Jets-Ravens game and it was a fun time.. This is one of those places you likely have passed a hundred times on the way to work or going to Scottsdale using Indian School Rd. It is set back into the strip mall so you would not see it from the street. Why Teakwoods is special comes from its extremely quality food which you would not expect from a place that lets you throw peanut shells on the floor. Like most bars it has a bevy of TVs and a rowdy but pleasant crowd.  The food was really good though I would never call this ""fine dining"". An extremely great place to go when you want to be stuffed with semi-greasy food..I had their famous wings and I can honestly say they were outrageous. I especially liked the cheese balls which are hard to find as WineBurger stopped carrying them. No particular reason this place wasnt 5 stars..it just didnt have that 5 star feel..maybe in the future when I go back."
3,"If I could give this 2.5 stars, I would.  But thats because Ive been to Joes Real BBQ, and so I know how good BBQ can be. Famous Daves is fine.  There are two of them I know of, and Ive been to both.  Theyre both fine. We visited this one, near Chandler mall, for lunch.  We ordered off the lunch menu.  My wife and I both had the brisket sandwich.  I had the Wilbur beans, she had fries.  It was fine.  Not great, but OK. The brisket meat itself did not seem to be smoked.  At all.  Meat has a certain look and taste when it has been smoked, and this just didnt have it.  Frankly, the meat seemed sorta pale...as if it had been boiled instead of grilled or smoked.  And either the meat or the sauce was excessively salty.  It wasnt severe (or I would have returned it), but it was noticeable.  Salt should enhance flavor, not stand out as a major flavor. And a note about the sauce.  I examined one of their for sale bottles (you can buy their sauce to take home).  Did they use molasses or brown sugar, as most self-respecting BBQ chefs would?  No.  High fructose corn syrup.  Yuck.  Besides that stuff being poison to your pancreas, its just ""not right"".  Thats not how BBQ is done. Anyway, Famous Daves is really nothing special.  The BBQ is ""OK"", but not very authentic.  Given the choice I would take Joes, hands-down.  But if you want some BBQ, and are nowhere near Joes, this will do.  Beats the heck out of Toms BBQ, thats for sure (see my review of Toms...truly awful).  And the beans and fries are pretty good."
4,"My guy and i decided to try this new salon that just opened a couple months ago. The man and woman working there are so friendly! We were chatting the whole time. As soon as we sat down they offered l us water. The chairs are great and the water color changes as you sit there, kinda cool. The pedicure includes a hot lotion and rock message that is awesome!  Great place, we will be back!"
3,I love Defalcos.  I hate Defalcos.  The food is always fresh and Im never disappointed.  The big problem is that the service is so slow.  Its  great that they have a market for you to look around while you are waiting for your food.  I know I can get quality tasting food but I have to here when I know Im not in a rush to be somewhere.
5,"If you really care about your health and want a sincere doctor who honestly cares about his patients and believes in his practice, then this is the doctor for you. I am a 40-year-old woman who couldnt be happier with the care I have received and how I feel after seeing Dr. E for the past year. I recommend Dr. E to all my friends and family and the ones who actually listen have been very happy with their care as well.  In response to Lisa N., it is possible that you are one of the few people who is immune to Botox and similar products, which is to no fault of the doctor. I too was extremely unhappy with subsequent treatments given by another doctor only to find out that no amount of the toxin would ever be effective for me because my immune system works too well. Ironic, isnt it?  You should always do your homework when looking for a new doctor, especially when you know exactly what type of treatment you are seeking. For example, if you are simply interested in the HCG diet program instead of overall health and you had been elsewhere for less money then likely that place is a better match for you.  We dont live forever, but we can live better while we are here. Take control of your medical care, its your body and therefore your decision. Dr. E at Carefree Health Path is a great place to start your empowering journey to health."
5,"After eating chocolate covered bacon for desert (yeah, thats really one of the options for desert), I say that I was completely stratified with Becketts Table. From the moment I called to make a reservation I knew that this restaurant was going to have great staff and service. The staff greeted us at the entrance and give us options for seating. I was VERY pleased with the pricing on the menu especially the wine bottle prices! Its just a matter of time, and I will be back for an evening meal! Speaking from living in the Arcadia area, this is just the restaurant we need in the area--a nice community restaurant with pleasing food! If you are looking for a nice dining experience, this is the place for you!"
4,"Had a great time staying here for a few days.  Golf course was amazing (payed twilight for $75 on the desert course starting at 1pm).   Was able to do a nice long 3 hour hike Camelback mountain. Service is excellent here and accomodations are lovely.  24 hour pools and hot tubs are nice. As are the fire pits... But nothing is cheap here for sure! $22-27 scotches by the firepits.   $10 bagel sandwiches at the ice cream parlor by the lobby.   Dont come here if you dont like to spend money!  Also, i would avoid eating the meals here. Food is not the best and it costs an arm and a leg.   Would love to come back for some more golf and hiking.  You def. get more perks staying at Canyon Suites (free wifi, free access to business center, nicer and more private pool and hot tub area, better free wine tasting, and nice amenities like free cider, arnold palmer, fruit, and cookies throughout the day."
3,"Lavelles just opened the end of April. So far Ive been twice once for lunch and once for ice cream. Both times I waited about 15 minutes. Understandable considering their new. I wanted to make my own type of sandwich and the older women said they dont do that. Okay. So I wanted to get the arizona sandwich with a different bread, she says the bread change is 1.00. Really?! Sandwich also had no mayo/mustard. All in all its good to have new restaurants out here, but this one is just okay. **Update: I have went in on 2 different dates to get ice cream. Only to find out the 2 flavors I want are gone. Should get back-ups of their items."
5,"I moved from Philly this past summer and Ive searched all over the Valley for a ""GOOD"" Pizza. After eating lots of tasteless and cardboard pizza, I found Momma Mia when I moved into Arcadia! I love the hole in the wall vibe! Just like home :) The sauce is great and super tasty! The dough tastes slightly sweet and is fluffy..Its what makes the pizza so great and there is a brickoven!! I love it! My husband and I order the pizza/wing special .The wings are so hot and spicy ( we order the hot, but it comes in buffalo and mild) They have an extensive menu of pasta, sandwiches and salads. I want to try their Philly Steak next, but for the time being I still make mine at home.  Every pizza place likes to say its ""New York Style"", but this place really does a NYC pizza. Well the best nyc pizza youre gonna get in AZ, Something about the water."
4,"Im a gelato purist, so Chill is right up my alley. You dont have a million flavor choices, but the ones they have are classics done right, so there is no need. The same lady is always working when I go, and she is very friendly and upbeat. They havent yet perfected the multi-flavor ratio in one cup, but Im sure that will improve, and Im a huge fan of anything with a punch card. So far my favorite gelato spot in the Valley :)"
4,"I went here for dinner since my friend said the the location in Cave Creek was one of her favorite Mexican restaurants in the Valley. However, living in Phoenix and Scottsdale, we decided to go to the Fountain Hills location. Plus, another friend lives there so it was a more central location for all of us.  We arrived around 7 and it wasnt crowded at all, we got a table right away. We got chips and salsa to start which was perfect since I was really hungry with it being way past my dinner time. One of the girls got a pomegranate margarita and she said that it was really sweet but good. I got the fish tacos and they were delicious. Probably the best fish taco Ive had. I was expecting some sort of fried fish, probably cod. I was pleasantly surprised that it was grilled and the two tacos came wrapped up in the foil pouch they were cooked in. It also had this really good sauce. The hard shell tacos that my friends got also looked really good. The shell looks homemade, fried, and super crispy. My friend asked for extra cheese which they brought out in a small dipping bowl. She was also charged extra for this. The tacos didnt come with that much cheese to begin with, so thats kind of a rip-off. The price isnt that cheap either, I would definitely say its on the pricey side.   The atmosphere was just okay. I was reading how its the most romantic location, etc. but maybe theyre just referring to the Cave Creek location. All of the employees were nice and even took a group photo of us at the end since my friends were visiting from all over. I definitely want to go to the Cave Creek location in the future to see what all the fuss is about, but itll definitely be more of a special occasion thing since its definitely a hike from Scottsdale. In the mean time, Ill stick to my other local favorites for tacos."
5,"I took a friend from Europe here this past week. I cannot express how much the attention to detail is welcomed and so wonderfully presented. By this I mean, the service, the presentation, the food, the atmosphere. The staff knows that when you walk in, you will be spending good money and they expect to take care of your whim and cater to your palette.  The steaks are buttery, delicious and worth every bite. The sommelier made a wonderful suggestion to go with our order and he was spot on in his selection. This may not be the place to dine on a regular basis for some, but if you plan to make a special night of an occasion, I recommend highly Ruths Chris. I have not been to the one in Phoenix, only the Scottsdale location, but I would be hard pressed to say that it would be any less tasty.  My buddy was treated so kindly and his comment (paraphrased) was as follows: Its too bad that so much of the world hates Americans. They think that Americans are so loud and bossy. They can be so kind and so willing to to be helpful when they want. In Europe, no one cares if you are from France or Italy or Dernmark because we are like states next to each other. In America, everyone wants to know about where you are from and want to hear you talk about it and the places you have been. Thank you to the staff for being a part of my friends visit."
3,I will say that the weakest link in this restaurant is the maturity of the staff.  We went for lunch and asked to sit on the patio.  Most of the people were eating but then they sat a large group right next to us that only wanted to drink and smoke.  I know smoking it allowed on the patio but since it wasnt the only table available AND the rest of us were eating food I think they should have sat them a little farther away from us. Our order wasnt right but couldnt get the server to come back so we just let it go.  The food was great!  Had a few items from the small plates and then we had the bacon grilled cheese and the chicken sandwich.  Both very good.   My biggest complaint is that we were ignored unless we were actively looking around for someone and then snagged someone as they walked by.  I will try again as this place is still trying to find its way but service needs to be stepped up for sure.
5,"I was skeptical when I kept hearing how amazing Jimmy Johns is.  So I went in, and found my new favorite sandwich spot!  The inside was very noisey, but I liked the atmosphere.  The bread had an awesome fresh taste, and when I inquired about the difference between 2 sandwiches, the cashier was very helpful."
4,"Hipster hangout you can drag the kids along and not feel bad about it. The place is setup like a house and the first time you go it is for sure confusing.  Do I sit down or go to the counter or bar or what.. Its kind of a free for all.  I have been a few times and still feel a little awkward when I walk in.  The hot chocolate is great and the egg sandwich tasty.  The mac and cheese for evening is also really good.   The service is ok, but not overly helpful or friendly. The place is dripping with kids too cool for school, businessmen, and families... so a great spot to hit up if you are in downtown phx"
1,"I dined at this restaurant on a Saturday morning and was actually the very first guest.  I got greeted by the hostess and was promptly seated.  The service was phenomenal from when I walked over the door step and the ambiance is the restaurant was amazing .  I ordered the smoked salmon as an appetizer and the daily scallop special as the entree. When my salmon dish came out I said to my self ""WHAT in the hell?"" Two extremely thin slices of salmon, little salad, and a piece of bread with some aioli on the side.  Salmons cheap and they charged me $15 for this crap?  I work in the food industry and the food was crap. Next, the entree.  The waiter described the the scallop dish like it was heaven on earth.  Explaining to me how delicious this special was.  So I took his advice and ordered.  When the dish came out I said to my self again ""What in the HELL?""  Four small scallops, 2 baby carrots, broccoli rabe, and cilantro sauce.  The scallops werent seared enough, the broccoli rabe was brown and mush, and the baby carrots were still raw.  The funny thing was.  The sauce didnt even resemble any cilantro flavor at all.  I could of made this dish 1000x better and the entree took a big hit in my wallet, $32 for crap. The meal came out to roughly $60 and I left that restaurant to never try it again.  I could of gotten some pho for $8 would of been a hundred times happier than spending money that wasnt even mediocre."
4,"As best as I can figure out, there are 3 German restaurants in the Phx metro area.  Two of them are in the same parking lot in Mesa.  How does that happen? So anyway, what about Zur Kate.  Good food but an oddly small menu with no appetizers listed.   As for the restaurant itself its a pretty small place.  Not sure how the busy they get, but if they ever do you could be in for a wait. Back to the food for a moment.  While it was good, and somewhat German in composition Im just not sure of German food it was.  That being said, I could say the same for the other German restaurants here in Phx.  So, not so much of a knock as an observation."
5,Love the pita jungle!!!  My fave is the chicken and hummus appetizer.  Definitely enough for a meal and super cheap too.  Also love the chicken swarma sandwich and the chicken pizza.  You cant go wrong here.
5,"My wife and i just dined at this restaurant. I am a chef and must say that Chef Chriss concept is one I have not experienced.The food was outstanding, service excellent and the decore was creative,down to the flower pot wine bucket and old wooden crate that it sat on.  Our entrees were served on either a bed of sundried ploenta or baby spincach and blackrice.  What really intrigued me was the slaw made of shredded green papaya that was part of the appetizer course. Being a chef I had to share a neat appetizer, that i recently found, using a baby corn shoot!  Chef keep up the suberb Cafe Monarch Bravo."
1,"Your reviews are hilarious!!   (shoot--who was this referring to??) I try to avoid WM.  Im always warned about the possibility of TB or now, pig flu.  I think the hub just doesnt want to go shopping--not that I LIKE shopping. I know someone who worked WM in WA and she says the conditions are just horrible for employees.  Ive spoken to at least one cashier that is actually FRIENDLY and LOVES his job benefits and bonuses.  Hes a minority I guess bc as you all said, YOU CANT FIND ANYTHING and CANT GET HELP without attitude, usually.   Im standing there staring at 2 mgrs, and they just ignore me for a few minutes?  I didnt want to interrupt the conversation, so I waited.  FINALLY, one asks if I need help???  NAAAAAH, I was just admiring your huge body and wondered how long it might take me to look that way.  FOOLS!   On my last visit, a customer said ""excuse me"" to the 3 employees behind me in the aisle.  I glanced at her and she sighed, rolled her eyes and shook her head as they all ignored her.  I chuckled and acknowledged her frustration.  Then one employee pipes up with ""OH, Im sorry maam, can we help you?""  She asks to find an item, the customer thanks them, they say ""Youre welcome"", the customer leaves and they sarcastically continue to each other: ""THATS WHAT WERE HERE FOR.  NO, THATS NOT WHY WERE HERE.  Were not here to find stuff for stupid people, we have better things to do.""    Thats why, when I walk by an employee working, if they lay eyes on me, they immediately look away and pretend to be engrossed in their job, to avoid stopping to help.  WT?  Whats wrong w/this management???   I agree, you can find some deals and save some money, but the attitude is over the top.  There are a FEW employees that actually smile and appear friendly, at least when I see them, and I can point them out.  If not for the more often than not occurences as mentioned above, I stay OUT of WM as much as possible, which is a lot.  Ive drastically reduced my trips there, but more importantly, Ive cut out a huge chunk of purchasing from WM."
5,Yum yum yum. Husband and I first went there early on a First Friday night and were pleasantly surprised to be seated right away. We didnt want anything too heavy since we were planning on doing some walking so we split the Spanish cheese plate which was delightful. The fig cake is delicious!! Splitting the plate made the bill pretty affordable and it was just enough to fill us up without overdoing it. The server was very helpful in suggesting a champagne for me and red wine for husband. Dont remember what we had but my champagne had a strawberry in it and was perfectly bubbly.  Ambiance and decor is nice and mellow. Weve since been back with friends and it has been enjoyable for both a date night and chatting it up with people. Enjoy!
5,"What started out as a simple attempt to find a perfect birthday present turned into a life-long relationship with a fantastic jeweler.  I wanted to get my fiancé (girlfriend at that time) a simple diamond pendant necklace for her birthday and could not find anything that even came close to matching her style. I searched the internet for days and reluctantly went into a few jewelry stores hoping for the best, but expecting the worst. I, like most people [guys] out there, had a bad feeling in a few stores I went to. Pushy sales people looking for the upsale, and sky high prices. I was getting very discouraged about the process, but that all changed when I came to Hyde Park.  The super friendly staff made everything easy for me. There was no pushy sales process or anyone trying to upsell me something I didnt want. They immediately offered me a bottle of water and started to talk to me like a real person. After a few minutes of speaking with a very lovely woman in the store she suggested we think about something custom. At first  I was thinking ""here we go; this is where I am going to get stuck!"", but I was all wrong!!! We looked a few loose stones and I got a great education about diamonds. I went home later that night and did some research on the internet and found that the prices we as good, or better than any of the big online retailers. I could never get my head wrapped around buying a diamond online, sight unseen, and I am so glad that I found Hyde Park.  In the end I have used Hyde Park to create a custom pendant diamond necklace that my fiancé absolutely loves (it is perfect on her), and I also used Hyde Park to get the diamond for the engagement ring, as well as everything else to follow.  Want to know what service is all about in the jewelry business, check out what Hyde Park did for me. I picked out an amazing diamond for the engagement ring (chose the loose stone again) but had no idea what kind of a ring my fiancé would want. So Hyde Park said ""how about we just put it in a classic Tiffany solitaire setting as a temporary setting and then after you give it to her, you can come back in together and pick out the perfect setting and wedding band set"". I was like, seriously?!! You can just do that??? In the end Hyde Park will be my jeweler for life. They helped me create the perfect simple birthday present, and took that service all the way through doing a custom engagement ring and matching wedding band set. This is the jewelry store for any guy who wants great service, great prices, and like me, doesnt have the first clue about how to make the perfect decision. Just let Hyde Park take the stress out of it like they did for me!"
5,Excellent service and great quality.  I will always bring my alterations here.  Had an emergency and needed a hem done in a couple of hours and they had it sone sooner than expected!
4,"Seriously good curry. Serious. Im not joking. Im serious, the curry is very good. Usually when a restaurant has pictures of the food on the menu I become suspicious (think of Dennys and Village Inn), but here the photographs are not indicative of anything bad. In fact, the food looks good. Did I mention the curry is really good."
4,"Monday... BIG screen football, volume up, dont come here Mon night if you dont want to be immersed in football. $5 burgers that are reg $10, combined that with happy hour deals 4-7 pm every day of delicious GOOD drafts for just a bit over $3 & all flatbreads & apps 1/2 price. At normal prices I would feel more 3-star. But if you know what you are getting into & come for deals, it is great for what it is. Waiter was VERY knowledgeable of menu, helpful with suggestions.   Atmosphere really is great with the dark wood ceilings to floors, big place but broken up with all sorts of nooks, interesting apothecary stuff Apollo over in cabinets, with Seattle Seahawks stuff thrown in."
4,"Eaten here a few times. Just finished lunch and had a great salad & sandwich. The salad I had was the spinach with poached egg, it was awesome. My taste is for savory, ""umami"", this was perfect with the egg bacon and light dressing. The chicken sandwich was good with basil and brie. Then the creme brulee with tahitian vanilla was great. Just a nice quaint place to sit outside and have a good lunch. One problem I have with Zinc Bistro is that they have Stella on tap, great right? But for $7! Thats one for $7. Come on, maybe $4. I just bought 12 for $10 at Total Wine."
5,"Mister Softee is an all-star, he showed up on time, provided great service, and has great tasting ice cream... Give him a call !!"
4,"Yolis has recently been popping up on Yelps Best Of front page. Many people are mouthing out and as the food whore that I am, I needed to go out and try it for myself. My previous research told me that there were many 5 stars and 3 stars reviews regarding the ambiance, service and food. It seemed that the place had be 5-stars for a while but trending analysis showed a decline in the late 2011- early 2012. Alright enough nerd talk-  it was a Saturday morning, I was starving and I needed a place to have brunch with my lady friend in town. When it comes to brunch at Yolis, you really need to leave all your expectations at the door. The neighborhood its in is a little sub-par, the parking situation isnt grand and the interior and patio decor resembles a home that stopped paying for landscaping services a long time ago. The tables outside are all basic basic plastic, they are not squeaky clean (or perfectly leveled) and the seating is pretty limited. If you are coming to Yolis, you are coming here for the food and nothing else, this aint no brunch at the Four Seasons. Their menus are strictly breakfast/brunch related but at a 2-sided page list, their breakfast choices do have a large variety of flavors and prices. The food is on the stealthier side with skillet dishes, omelets and diner-style potato sides. My friend and I ordered their most popular dish, the El Monte- Hawaiian french toast sandwich filled with egg whites, turkey, bacon and cheese with a spicy orange marmalade. At about $7, the sandwich was pretty large and filled me up easily after just half of it. The french toast itself was soft and spongy and the bacon had some crisp, but the turkey was very thinly-sliced deli meat so it didnt have a lot of flavor and the spicy marmalade was tasty but not spicy at all. The service was a tad slow but the lady was very very courteous and nice to us, she just didnt stop by very often so we had to wait around for our drinks and our check for quite a while. Overall I wasnt blown away with Yolis but I would recommend as a place with decent portions and good prices. As of now, a 3.75 stars on my book. I am a big supporter of local restaurants and I love seeing a family-owned business thrive. With a little bit more decor, faster service and a cleaner environment this place can return to be the GEM that people used to talk about. Yoli, if you are reading this- I hope you take this advice, we all want to see you succeed so we hope you can get back on that horse and impress the hell out of us. Good Luck!!"
2,"Not bad, but not great.  Service was really friendly, and prompt.  Food was ""meh"", maybe I just ordered the wrong thing."
4,"Economical discount theater!  For the price of what other theaters charge just for admission, you can get your popcorn and drink too!  Seats are a little small, but there are usually plenty of them.  It is of course not the newest releases, but I am never up to date on my movie watching anyway.  Must have cash, ATM available in the lobby area."
5,"The Valley Beer Drinkers Meetup Group has been coming here for months - since before the name change - on occasional Wednesdays for $3 craft pints & the fantastic wings special. Weve always had a good experience, and the extensive, rotating brew selection keeps the venue fresh. Ive been urging the owner to add at least ONE Pilsner to the IPA-heavy menu, and last night he delivered with a quintessential model: Munchener Spaten Pils! It was great. Adding to the experience was the excellent food. Portions were generous and satisfying!. One member ordered the Fish & Onion Rings, and when it arrived, two others immediately ordered their own! I cant remember better fish (pollack here) or more perfect onion rings! Homemade potato chips were remarkable, and the fry cook definitely knows the craft! Diners have many options for sides w/ entrees, which is a generous touch. Only the cole slaw was a bit bland.  Service was friendly & generally good, but not attentive enough later in the meal. Thanks for separate checks, too. I really look forward to returning for brews and to further explore the enticing menu!"
5,"Dude...a happy hour that is TRULY happy!!!   This joint is relatively swank for all the deals it has.  Nice decor, good bar, FRESH seafood (seriously...this is some good quality).  Starting at 4:00 p.m., they have $5 martinis AND $0.75 oysters.  YUM! On top of that, they offer discounts on other appetizers such as the bread and cheese plate, a GIANT crab cake, a salads, and shrimp dishes.  All are tasty. For all the Zoners out there (yeah, I said it), you have to check out this place.  You will have a great time!  NOTE - beware of dirty old men.  Theyll hit on your friends!"
5,"I loved this casual dining experience at the gorgeous Phoenician.  I stopped in for happy hour with some friends, and we had a great time.  We sat in front of the fireplace and sipped beers over appetizers.  The location alone is worth going for, but the food was good and service was even better."
4,"I have not been to the Outback in years as past visits have, well, sucked. I am not one to complain, I just never go back if I have a bad experience or two. Seriously, there are too many good places to go out to eat to return to business who dont focus on their food.  So my boss loves this place and she wanted to go and of course as she is the boss I agreed to return to the Outback with her.  I have to admit this place has changed. Our server, Bree, was excellent! A server can make or break your meal and Bree was on her game.  The food was really good, OK, I am super picky and was ready to hate it as I have in the past but tonight was different. I ordered the teriaki marinated sirloin. It came perfectly cooked at medium with sweet potato, salad and bread all for $12.95.  Maybe I got lucky and came here on a good night but I am glad I did and will definitely return."
5,"Bison Witches is a bit religious for me.  The hearth is in Tucson, but they did a good job of transplanting the same food experience to Tempe. Their filling sandwiches offer a sort of primitive bliss with the roughly-cut thick slices of bread - best tip is to go with the half sandwich/half soup (their half is really a whole) - Their chili is the best thing going..."
5,"I am always comfortable in Michelinas, the service is excellent and they are not rushing you to ""turn the table"".  Michelinas cooking is fantastic!  Her daily specials are so inviting that I rarely order from the menu.  The drinks are excellent, bread just right, and the after dinner complimentary cordial is a nice finish.  One of the best kept secrets in Phoenix!"
4,"I was out shopping with my 16 year old son, and we decided to stop in and try Americas. The delightful young lady behind the counter highly suggested that we try at least one thing with the pastor filling so we ordered the meal for two for $20. That comes with chips and salsa, two burritos, two tacos and two drinks The carne asada was very good...but OMG...the pastor was amazing! We just wished we had ordered the burrito with the pastor and the taco with the carne asada instead of the other way around. The sweet young thing kept checking in on us...we were there at 3 in the afternoon so it was quiet...but gosh, the young girls had just been fawning over us all day! On the way home, I looked at my kiddo and realized hes pretty darn good looking...so maybe that explains all the delightful customer service that day! Anyway, I can understand some of the complaints about it being a little pricey, but I think you are really getting a quality product and that is worth it to me. Plus, I thought the burrito was especially meaty. And as a carnivore I totally appreciate getting my meat on! Cute place, yummy food, fun day out with the teenager. Really, you cant ask for more than that."
5,Of course it gets hot in the summer. Youre going to be watching bands in a basement with a bunch of people and depending on when / whats going on there might be some idiots mawshing.  Sound quality is great for the size. Glad they reopened one of my favorite venues. and YES everybody has gotten lost the first time they tried to find the Nile. The main & front room have shows as well.
5,"Just went for my first time last night with ""the ""girls"". Two of us heard about it and after I read the reviews and checked out the menu it was slated for our next night out. Anyway we had a memorable evening with wine, the make-your-own cheeseboard and the to-die-for pear and gorganzola flatbread pizza. It was topped with fried sage leaves -- different and delicious. Afterward we were able to fit dessert and shared a huge slice of fresh layer cake filled and frosted with dark chocolate. Sublime! Cant wait to go back and try other dishes - definitely made it to my Restaurants to Frequent list :)"
2,This place is so so.  Ok food.  Ok atmosphere.  Just a decent restaurant in Buckeye.
5,"Best and most helpful hardware store I have visited. Thank God I live almost across the street! After many, many home projects and recently rebuilding my kitchen, I have frequented this Ace almost more times than I should. But I am always pleased at how quickly and smoothly my searches at this Ace are. Try it, youll like it!"
4,"Picazzos pizza is excellente!  My wife and I were told about this little pizza place by a friend who swore by it, so we decided to try it out. We are sooooo glad that we did because the food quality & taste was amazing. My wife loves it so much that when I asked her where she wanted to go for her birthday...Dr. Weils restaurant in Scottsdale or Picazzos....guess which one she chose? Picazzos FTW! The prices are a little on the high side, but I am a firm believer in the saying, ""you get what you pay for"" & this pizza place was worth every penny."
5,"Im currently staying at Camelback Inn for 3 days. A pleasant treat after a molar extraction last Friday afternoon. Although Ive sworn not to be seen in public with a swollen face, I am truly enjoying this trip. Theres a trail just behind this resort and a completely awesome view of the hills. Awesome and I mean it. My hubby is out on his meetings and Im juggling my work (the luxury of running your own biz, take it anywhere you want do it anytime you want, well not most of the time.. ).  Just had lunch at Hoppins Jack. Excellent service, friendly staff (especially the  handsome young german ;)). Anyway, ordered chicken sandwich with cashews and mandarin orange, delish. My lil girl was pacified with a vanilla sundae with fruity swirl (raspberry or is it strawberries?) with peaches and berries.. I had a few spoonful, yummy. Kids menu was dirt cheap, fries and 3 pieces of chicken strips or rather crispy chunks  was actully tasty. I still have until tomorrow. Maybe if I have time, Ill head down to the spa for a desert rain loofah. Oh, as for the room, great decor, quite spacious and an outdoor porch with umbrella and seat to lounge around in the sun. Simply love the view. It takes me away from everything. Im in heavenly desert.Highly recommended."
4,"I order the same thing at every Vietnamese restaurant. Rice Vermicelli Bun with Grilled Pork and Egg Roll, and spring rolls. This order does not change. Ever. They do the pork here more like a pork patty, or meatloaf if you will. In Vietnamese cuisine, there are two different ways to do it, the other being grilled slices of pork. I dont know which I prefer as they are very very different. You get a large amount of noodles, very fresh vegetables, and a generous portion of meat. The sauce is tasty, and everything seems very high quality. Spring rolls are good, as is the peanut sauce they serve them with. The service could be worse, but not much. Its pretty horrendous. Atmosphere is typical of a Vietnamese restaurant, total dive."
4,"My daughter and I sort of stumbled on this place a couple of weeks ago.  We were at the Ulta just around the corner and she said she was hungry and she LOVES pizza.  We have been here twice as of this writing.  The second time around was ""Kids Eat Free"" night.  That is Wednesay for those of you with kids and its a good deal.  I will eventually put together a list of Kids Eat Free places in the area.  For now let me tell you about NYPD..... The pizza is a winner!  Nice crust, great topppings!  They use paper thin slices of sausage instead of hunks of sausage.  The flavore is great too.  My daughter had a slice of black olive pizza and they were very generous with the olives....she loved it!  I have had the ceaser and the house salads and both were good and fresh.   So for the Kids Eat Free night adults need to order an entree (I think this includes a whole pizza too, not sure though) There were several things to choose from including cheese ravioli, baked ziti, and  lasagne.  I chose the lasagne and it was delish!  Piping hot with melted mozeralla over the top, I could not stop eating it!!  The flavors melded together nicely and it reminded me of my Moms lasagne.  And did I mention the bread......OMG!!  The little ibites of heaven are sooooo good!!  I could have eaten ten of them!!  They are homemade, the real deal, yeasty goodness!!  Warm and just a little chewy, the flavor was amazing!!   Oh and the Desert Flower Ice Tea.....so refreshing!!!  I keep thinking about it, thats how good it is!! Try the canollis.....you wont be disappointned.  Kids get an ice cream sundae with their meal.  On our first visit Lori, our server, was a real sweetheart.  She gave me some coupons and signed me up for the email list.  And on our next visit , Jessica was awesome and attentive too! This is a small place but they also have an outdoor patio with misters.  The bar is tiny, probably seats 10.  Flat screen for watching the Dbacks and some good beers on tap, along with Happy Hour specials makes this a great place!!  This will be somewhere we will frequent!!  Thanks NYPD!!!"
5,"5 stars for bein the only bar in Phoenix where I was first scared to order a drink. but- thats why I love this place. That, and its near the Trunk Space."
3,"I have been wanting to eat here since it opened and finally got the opportunity.  The ambiance and service is excellent, however that was not the reason why I was there.  I was there for the food that a lot of people have been raving about. I read somewhere that the hanger steak was their specialty and I dont disagree.  I had a taste and it was indeed very tasty.  And if I go back I will definitely get it.  And at under $20 it is a steal.  However, I ordered the 8oz filet for myself.  It was cooked properly and tasted good but not memorable.  The individual sauces that you can order on the side were also nothing special.  And yes, the fries were just as everyone on Yelp said they were; good but just like In-n-Outs, but cooked a bit longer.  The sides dishes were ok at best and were a bit on the smaller side.  However, the potato gratin was amazing and better than I have had at any steak place thus far. While it is less expensive than Mastros/City Hall, I think that for a few extra dollars it is worth going to a better place.  In my opinion, Mastros/City Hall have much better steaks and better/bigger side dishes.  However, J & G does have a better ambiance."
5,"This is one of my favorite theaters. With that said, I suggest you prepare yourself for having to wade through an onslaught of pre-teen cliques if you plan on making your way to the ticket counter on a Friday or Saturday evening. If youre like me, safety is a concern.  Not to worry here.  Ive always seen an officer on premises during the main drop-the-kids-off / pick-the-kids-up window. This location still has a new feeling to it, and it is clean and cool.  Nice cushy seats with cup holders, and I have yet to hear the soles of my shoes stick to the floor as I walk down an aisle. My favorite seats are the ones with the railing in front.  A place to perch my feet. -Swoop"
4,"Arrived at 4:30 and staked out our place in line for the 5pm opening.  There were quite a few people ahead of us so it was clear we would be in the second round of people.  Placed our name on the list and went next door for wine and apps.  The goat cheese crostini was excellent.  The wait staff was pleasant and kept us updated on the wait.  After an hour fifteen we were seat. Waiter was extremely pleasant. We started with the antipasto (wood roasted vegetables, Sopressata, Bite of Cheese) and then ordered 4 pizzas Margherita - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Basil topped with cremini mushrooms,  ROSA - Red Onion, Parmigiano Reggiano, Rosemary, AZ Pistachios WISEGUY - Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage and salami BIANCOVERDE - Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula and added Prosciutto di Parma (favorite) Service was great and the pizza well worth the wait"
3,"first time here and i wasnt all that impressed. lets just say i was afraid to ask my waitress when she was due.. but thats beside that point. bunch of tvs tho i had to squint to see whats going on. my eyes arent that great but whatever. it was a wednesday so they had margaritas and mexi beers on daily special, which varies. had 3 margaritas fairly fast. felt nearly nothing. weak as hell. i expected to half stumble out of the place but really i was fine. decent selection of wing flavors. which i might start seeing as a bad sign. tried the El Heffe wings. dry and dusty but a decent taste, with no real kick like it says, except maybe in the stomach itself. and the extra dollar for them? shouldve been a dollar less. cant screw up peanuts. the peanut shells on the floor novelty was probably the best part of the place, because you cant be that messy anywhere else but a baseball game. thats an extra star in itself.  the rest of the menu looked good so i may be back on a day with better drink specials and try something new to eat. ill update this shit if i do so......"
5,Thank you so much for the good reviews. I went here for a business meeting 8-13-2010. I ate soo much I hurt myself. Everything was great I especially loved the lamb and chicken curry. The staff was excellent and very kind. I will recommend my new favorite Indian food restaurant to everyone. ;)
5,"Ive been to this Dicks location a bunch of times and Ive got to say that Ive gotten more help from the employees in this one that Ive ever gotten from any other location. Ive spent some major time with the guys in the gun dept and theyre always more that helpful regardless of how busy and how many people they have waiting for them.  Major props to those guys for good knowledge and patience. Another time I was there I wanted some new shorts for softball and they didnt have and Ls left but jokingly I checked the Under Armour manikin as he was wearing the same shorts, and what do ya know... L.  It was near closing time and the associates were getting their stuff done so they could go home (Ive worked retail and I know at closing time you just want everybody to bail so you can clean and go home).  I asked a girl around the corner I was able to rob the manikin of his clothes and she laughed and had no problem taking him apart and yankin the shorts right off!  I was so happy as I had a game the next day and didnt want to be running around looking for these shorts. Think Im joking? lol - http://www.flickr.com/photos/ryno/4113416766/ Anyways - good store, always clean and everybody seems very nice and knowledgable in their area.  Never had an issue there."
3,Let me first say that this is a nice place. The Chips and Salsa were some of the best I have ever had.  My Wife and I both ordered Soft Shell ground beef tacos. The ingredients were great and everything tasted very good. However I would like to note that the tacos were swimming in grease. Overall It was one of the better places we ate in the phoenix area.
2,"Standard Burger King fare served at a snails pace.  One cook, one sandwich maker, one cashier, plus 30 people in the queue. Please help the economy and the waiting customers by hiring some staff!"
4,"The food is good quality. The atmosphere is nice. The owner and his wife work hard to make you feel welcome. Skip the chorizo gravy, everything else is a solid B."
3,Fancy  shop with great kitchen items that I would use for our kitchen.  It seems whenever I go in there their products dont work.  Avoid ordering any of their coffee pots because we had to return them twice in a row. It seems like whenever we walk in there the employees dont seem to be knowledgeable about the products there.  I give this store three stars for having a variety of kitchen items and an enchanting place to visit.
5,"I love the Tempe Library. The Culture Pass is a great program, the audiobook selection is good, and the seemingly unlimited resources are wonderful."
5,"Ive been a patient of Dr Lienaus since I was six years old!  I usually dont care who my primary care physician is, but when it comes to my dentist, theres no way in heck I would switch.  I even referred a co-worker to him recently!   Hes very honest, upfront, and has such a great support staff.  Colleen is the NICEST receptionist!  One of the hygienists has been there for years (I forgot her name!!) and is also a very friendly woman. I definitely recommend Dr Lienau!"
2,"My friends and I got a 10-person karaoke room and ordered food while we sang. The room is SMALL --in other K places Ive been to, that would have been a room for 5 people. With 10 people in there, we turned into a sweaty airless mess very quickly. Secondly, their song choices are not good. Theyre behind about 2 years. Had we known, we would not have gone there. The food was mediocre; Ive had better sushi. A room rental comes with a complimentary sushi platter, which was one roll (no idea what it was, even though i ate a piece); some edamame; two ribs. I ate the edamame; they werent cooked through because they were hard and had that slightly spicy raw taste.  We went on a Friday and it was packed to the gills with Scottsdale d-bags. At least the servers were very sweet, even though they messed up drink orders once and the bill once."
3,"Being the B, L, and D (breakfast, lunch and dinner) restaurant of a major valley resort takes allot of versatility. From scrambling eggs to grilling a piece of meat the new Ricos American Grill at the Point Hilton Squaw Peak Resort shows that all this can be done and more on a daily basis.  With two massive patios, a large bar and lounge area coupled with a fantastic selection of locally made beers on tap, just beckons you to try them all out. This is easily done by ordering up a Beer Flight ($7) which gets you 4 5oz glasses of their best brews, though this will be tough to chose, theyre all good. Then you can order a capped 64oz growler ($20) to go! A growler is simply a large glass jug filled with your favorite beer, your choice. These are all the rage in other cities so I was excited to see Ricos making this offer. Id fill it with my latest favorite, Left Hand Milk Stout Sweet Stout. Think rich flavors of chocolate and coffee blended with milk sugars to give a sweet and creamy taste.  In the large dining room youll notice a wood fired oven. Unfortunately Ricos doesnt take full advantage of this, only offering a handful of menu items cooked in it including the BBQ Chicken Flatbread ($12). Covered with pulled chicken, red onions, Ricos BBQ sauce and mozzarella, this paired well with our beers though could have used a bit more salt, easily remedied. Another glimmer of what could be was the Wood Oven Baked Penne ($13). Several large meatballs, roasted tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella and pesto ricotta cheese and al dente pasta made for a hearty satisfying meal.  A bit lighter but bold with flavor, the Chopped Salad ($10, add grilled chicken $3) made with grilled corn, black beans, bacon, tomatoes, cucumber, avocado, and BBQ-ranch dressing was shaken, not stirred, literally. The salad is brought out in a large martini shaker, dressing added on the spot then shaken well. Kind of a neat twist on table-side salad service, whats old is new again.  The Wicked Meatloaf ($15) could have used some of Ricos BBQ sauce for a sweet contrast instead of the semi-boring-more-like-brown-gravy cracked pepper demi. The meaty slabs were paired up with roasted garlic mashed potatoes that were well seasoned and comforting.    Perfectly cooked and perfectly tender, the New York Strip Steak ($21) had a warm poblano and bacon relish that I could have eaten by the spoonful. The smoky sweet relish made the need for any sort of steak sauce not necessary. Along side was a heaping helping of green chile mac n cheese, so creamy and so gone, delish.  Apple Skillet For 2 ($7) takes apple slices simmered in a brown sugar and cinnamon, thanks to the wood-burning oven, then topped with cake crumbles and served with cinnamon vanilla gelato. If the skillet werent so hot I would have licked it clean.  While Ricos may not have yet achieved culinary greatness, what you do get is solid Southwestern influenced American grub."
4,"This is a great place for grilled cheese and tomato soup.  They also have a great selection of beers on tap.  Parking is hit or miss, but you cant miss a cute house that has been converted to a great gastropub.  Always a friendly face and you will always run into good folks."
5,Agree with the previous review. Something nice about this super target.  Leaving a review to back up the other!! My only gripe is I spend to much at Targer. Or my wife does anyway!!!
1,"Had some time to kill before the Ultimate pleY Date Yelp event, and Id wanted to share my love of Nobuos Dark chocolate mousse with green tea ice cream and sugared orange peels with my happy-go-lucky cousin, who has never been here before, so we stopped by at 5:17p to find that Nobuo wouldnt open till 5:30p, so we waited outside in the comfortable patio. After watching a couple of employees add lanterns to their outdoor umbrellaed tables, I noticed the ""OPEN"" sign on the front door, so we entered the resto, whereupon we were greeted warmly by a male host and shown to a two-top.  I didnt like the energy in that room, so I asked if we could sit elsewhere, and he said to choose wherever we wanted to sit.  We were the first customers, so we chose a four-top, knowing we wouldnt be taking up space for very long, anyway.  Glasses of water were delivered, and soon we met our female server (whose name on the receipt reflected ""Butai"").  When she laid down the menus, I told her we would only be having dessert and could we see the dessert menu?  I wished we had a video of the look she gave us, a look of pure distaste, as she gathered up the dinner and beverage menus and said ""We dont have dessert menus, as we only have two..."" and proceeded to tell us of the mousse and the almond-orange fritters.  She walked away, and as we loudly discussed about our losing our interest in dining there, she came back with napkins and utensils and asked if we decided what we were going to have.  I decided to forgo our servers very cold treatment and asked for the mousse.  After all, Id already finished a glass of ice-cold water and cousins phone needed recharging...   When Butai placed our chocolate mousse http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg#rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg on the table, I wanted to send it back.  Where was the lovely bowl and presentation of the last dessert I had here?  Was she serious in presenting us with this stale-looking mousse, with cracked edges and whose green tea ice cream had ice crystals on it?  I dont know about you, but the only times Ive seen crystals on ice cream is when it has slightly melted and placed back in the freezer to re-freeze.  For me, seeing crystals on ice cream is a sign that it is old...  I brought the receptacle and showed it to the male host, who assured me that all of the mousse is made daily at 4:00a and seeing cracks and bubbles in the mousse is normal, so I decided we would go ahead and try it, if for nothing else but to have something to report here.  The dessert was definitely not up to par with the pretty bowl http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ#o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ I had during our October OYE in taste and presentation, but it was OK.  The mousse was still cold and stiff, and it had a mouth-feel more of like thick chocolate ganache filling/icing on a cake- certainly not the silky-smooth chocolate decadence I knew it could be.  My cousin had to warm up to the dish, as the sound of chocolate and green tea together didnt seem like a great combo to her (I told her to trust me).  She also never enjoyed orange and chocolate together, but she liked it in this dessert.   I understand that the knowledge of having to serve only dessert instead of dinner AND dessert, which translates to a higher table bill, can be a bit of a disappointment, but why must you show your displeasure to your guests?  Butai, you were lucky that my cousin even left you the change for a tip- she didnt want to give you anything, and you certainly didnt deserve it!  When I told other Yelp friends about the sub-par service and dessert we just had, one replied she didnt enjoy the last time we had apps here (I think it was around Halloween and First Friday?) either.  Cousin and I thought it very poor taste that our server gave us that awful, condescending look after finding out we were just going to have dessert; We didnt deserve that!  I am never going to recommend Nobuo to anyone, anymore.  I even promised my Japanese friend (who lives and works overseas) Id treat her to a dining experience here when she comes to visit.  Guess Ill have to find another place to take her...  I dont want to risk getting the same treatment from Butai, or from another server should we come back here.   Sorry, Nobuo, but I wont be returning."
1,"After repeat visits it just gets worse - the service, that is.  It was as if we were held hostage and could not leave for a full 25 minutes because thats how long it took to receive hour check after several requests to several different employees.  Female servers might be somewhat cute but know absolutely nothing about beer and this is a brewpub.  I asked if they have an seasonal beers and the reply was no, that they only sell their own beers!  Even more amusing is their ""industrial pale ale"" is an IPA but it is not bitter.  So, they say its an IPA but its not bitter, its not a true-to-style IPA.  Then people say ""Oh I dont like IPAs"" and want something else.  Their attempt to rename a beer/style is actually hurting them.  Amazing. The menu was not the regular menu, just a small list of about 4-5 choices.  To make it worse, the actual menu on every table was wrong, yet the kept the menus on the tables anyway.  I heard 3 separate tables order the fried raviolis but they did not have them.   This place is *only* in business because of the location, location, location."
2,"I wasnt that impressed.  The machines look old and rusted, there didnt seem to be any air-conditioning and it had to be in the 90s inside since it was about 110 outside.  They did have overhead fans.  The price was cheap--45 cents per load to wash in a top loader but we only found one top-loader available that actually worked.  Half of them were Out Of Order.  Instead we dumped everything into two front loaders that claimed to do double loads and were out of there in pretty short order.  We took the clothes back to my daughters apartment building to dry in the laundry room there so she didnt have to stay with them."
5,"I loved this place! A bit pricey, but excellent quality. Been here twice and havent had anything we didnt like. The meat is great quality and theyll cook it how you desire as opposed to places that wont cook something below medium well. Great toppings for burgers, fries and shakes. Although everything is so big and filling I certainly cant have all that in one trip! Definitely a decadent tasty treat."
3,"This place is a hoot! A friend wanted to go to a movie that had been out for a while and it turned out that it was only still playing at this theater and one other.  This is typically a $3 theater, we happened to go on a Tuesday and it turns out they have $2 Tuesday so it was even cheaper. You definitely get what you pay for...this theater has been around for a while but its a great deal compared to the average movie gong cost. The concessions are also reasonable cost. Not the most comfortable seats in the world but you get what you pay for. The reason this place is a hoot? There are crazy decorations, life size figurines, games, etc, everywhere. I am sure I only really saw about a third of the decorations because it is just sensory overload. I hear they really deck it out at Christmas. So if you are looking for an affordable movie night and dont mind the seats from 20+ years ago this is a good option."
4,"I love F&E. Been shopping at the 12th street location since it opened there doors. This store works best for me since I live a very busy lifestyle. The pre-packaged foods, fruits and veggies make life easier for me. For a small store they have a great variety of things to choose from. This is not a one stop shop to find everything, however they seem to always have the items that work best for me. They dont have as many Safeway or Frys grocery deals, but they have discounted items regulary to choose from. There prices are slightly higher then Trader Joes for the amount of food. The store is always neat and clean. There is tons of help incase you have guestions. You can bag your own or there is someone there to help you."
3,"The best place to skip work and goofy golf in the spring and summer. Sure, its a little musty, old, run-down... but its a slice of my childhood and at least its still here.  I cant gather the courage to ride the roller coaster anymore and bumper cars just arent as appealing as they once were but the two story arcade still makes me squeal a little. The golf is great too! I would suggest playing courses one through three. The last two times Ive been we played course four and three and four has the least amount of attractions. Courses one and two are busiest, so its a choice between being stuck behind a bunch of kids or some really un-fun holes. Oh, and they do have a black and white photo booth."
5,"You know the story about the cobbler who created all those adorable shoes for the elves in the village? Ok, so maybe that story doesnt go exactly like that. Regardless, I found Old Town Scottsdales version of the magical cobbler who can do wonders with shoes and I found it at Tonys Shoe Repair! Here, Tony keeps shoes in spic and span condition and if you bring them in looking anything but shiny and new, you can be sure they will be returned as good as new. Tonys Shoe Repair also handles purses and belts. They do everything for a shoe including simple repairs such as widening and adding those little tricky bottom parts of heels that never seem to last, to giving your worn our shoes an entire face lift. The prices here are reasonable and he does the work for you in a speedy time frame. I dropped off my sad looking boots off and he freshened them up and added new heel bottoms to them in a days time. The fairytales can keep their magical cobblers, here in the real world weve got something even better -- Tonys Shoe Repair!"
4,I really enjoy the food here. Great breakfast fare. Great prices. Great service. The pancakes are really good. I still wonder why people go to Dennys.  This is wayyyyyy better.
5,"When I was recovering from surgery, I received of one of their arrangements. It was marvelous. The quality was unbeatable, with gorgeous blooms and fantastic presentation. They lasted for weeks. I am really pleased with this company and wouldnt hesitate to use them again!"
5,Anyone who tells you this place isnt amazing is cu cu for coco puffs. The owners are equally amazing. They will remember you and tell you amazing stories and the cocktails are always amazing. My favorite is the lychejito made from lychee infused vodka made in house. The spring roll bar is amazing and they always change it up for me if I ask for substitutions. There really isnt anything on the menu that isnt good they offer everything from Vietnamese sammies to amazing clay pots. I always go for the soup but that hasnt stopped me from trying everything else. Everything is always fresh and delicious. Their happy hour is awesome as well.
3,"Read all the reviews on Yelp and thought I give Changs Chinese Buffet a try. With a 4 star rating, I was expecting 4 star quality food. Well, some of it was good, but some of it could be better. First of all the atmosphere was pretty nice. It almost felt like Cheers, where everyone knew your name. Even though we didnt know anyone there, everyone talked to one another. The T.V. in the corner drew most everyones attention. You could tell who the regulars were. They were up front and closest to the T.V.  Most of the food was fresh. The Shrimp was very fresh and tasty. The rice was also seasoned probably and tasted almost as good as back East Chinese food, it just wasnt brown. Orange chicken was good, but a little hard. Not as moist and juicing like I wanted. The chicken was dry. It was flavors well, but was dry inside. Seems like it was under the heating lamp too long. The sweet & sour soup was good, but Ive tasted much better. The egg drop soup wasnt too good though. Spare ribs werent bad. Also a little dry, but not as bad as the chicken. The Egg-foo-yung was not good. Hockey puck shaped or not, it was too watery and didnt taste like real Egg-foo-yung. Everything else was pretty average. For the price, it wasnt bad. I would go back and eat there just so I could have the rice and shrimp. So pretty much 2 stars for the food and 1 for the atmosphere, service and cleanliness. Place was very clean and service was decent. Not a 4 star restaurant. Barely a 3 star. I think my wife gave it 2 stars. If you go there and find certain foods you like, its probably worth the $5-$6 to go back and eat as much as you want of those particular foods. Skip the bad stuff and eat all of the good tasting foods. Other buffets will run you $10-$15, so this place could be a gem if the food gets better."
3,"Just returned from the Phoenix area and so my friend insisted we check this place out.  Well basically the place serves an alcoholic versions of ""Slurpees"" in a variety of flavors.  If youve been to Las Vegas its the same as those slushy alcoholic drinks but made in a small Arizona-sized portions. I was ok hanging out on the patio but I dont think I would trek here as my destination.  The prices were ok as well as the scene.  In fact we saw a table of 8 people apparently just walk out without paying their bill so we watched half of the staff burst out the door running in different directions trying to apprehend the suspects.  Weird huh?"
4,"Back to Joes.... been several years as we are Westside dewelers and on Mothers Day we had Mom & Dad with us and suggested Joes after the hot experience out at Schenpfs farm.  Glad we went, Joes really is quite tasty, is it the best? - Probably not but that is all relative!  For the SE Valley, its our go to spot for BBQ.  We had the ribs, pulled pork, the Jumbo tater with Pork, coleslaw, mac & Chz, lemon cake, sweet patato pie.  All were really quite tasty.  The ""HOT"" sauce isnt THAT hot... but good lil kick.  One time we will be there when its not as hot out and get to try that nice large outdoor seating!  - I gotta say the Lemon Cake kicks ass!"
4,"Always good pizza, close to home and they serve beer and wine.  Plus my kids can play video games and husband can watch the game."
1,"Surprised this place isnt closed by now. Went here once when I first started going to ASU and never came back. Their ingredients are not fresh, gyro meat tastes old and decrepit. They really need to hire better pita makers who dont resemble drug addicts and derelicts. My pita was falling apart before it was even handed to me. Literally, by the time I got it to the table it was soggy and not even worth eating!"
4,"Had the Korean Beef over white rice. What a great dish.  Thin sliced beef in a garlic brown sauce with onions and great taste, served with a side of white rice. NOTHING over the top nothing trying to be something it is not. Just good food."
5,"The first couple of times I ate here I wasnt sure why people were always so crazy for this place. Its been about two years since my last visit and in the past couple of months Ive already been here like three times and wanted to go back more. Ive decided that its all about what you order; for example the first time I went I probably felt overwhelmed with all the choices and decided to go for something really plain like turkey with hardly any toppings, have fun! Their menu has a wide variety of yummy sandwiches and lots of new tastes to try. Also, dont be afraid to speak up. I was a little disappointed by the lack of lettuce and veggies on one of my veggie sandwiches but I also didnt pay attention. Now I ask for lots of lettuce and theyre happy to make it the way I like. They make their breads fresh and they have garlic-herb bread that has lots of flavor. I wont order a sandwich from there without a side of ranch dressing. I am a picky ranch eater...I hate mayonnaise so I am always super careful that ranch doesnt taste or resemble mayo. I usually like restaurant mayo that is a little more runny in consistency with lots of flavor. They have the best home made ranch dressing here! Pair it with the garlic-herb bread and your sandwich is going to be booming in flavor. OMG! Wipe...sorry I just started to drool a bit. Service is good...everyone runs at the same chill pace which seems to go well with the theme of this restaurant. My current favorite is the Humboldt sandwich...I get the Pinner (8"") but I swear some days I am so hungry I think Im going to order the Blunt (12"")...maybe someday soon. All sandwiches get toasted. Okay so toppings: Guacamole, sprouts, lettuce/spring mix, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, black olives (I get mine w/o), cucumbers, pickles, your choice of cheese (I get Swiss), with their house goodies (EVOO, vinegar, herb mixture on top). Now that I found my sandwich, I crave it all the time and cant wait for my next visit. Oh, be sure to check their daily specials too! If youre lucky enough to be in their delivery area...well, darn you then! :-)"
3,"Probably more worthy of 3.5 stars.  Damn the Yelp constraints!  Marketplace was pretty busy tonight now that you can actually go out in the evening without a gentle breeze feeling more like a blow torch in your face.  In spite of that, our wait to be seated was fairly quick.  But where was our server?  Outside listening to the band?  We need liquid refreshment! Finally our server arrived and apologized for the wait at the same time the manager arrived and also apologized and comped us an appetizer.  Wow!  We hadnt even complained.  We had the hummus which was very tasty but a little thin and a mango tandoori chicken pizza.  Nice combination of sweet mango, spicy curry sauce, and the grilled chicken.  Service was excellent once we got over the initial bump. While I usually dont plan to go to CPK, its nice to know this one is there."
2,"I just cannot understand why this place is so highly rated. Could it be that people have never experienced barbeque outside of Arizona, so they have no basis of comparison? But even that cannot be true. We have Joes in Gilbert, and even Famous Daves is pretty darn good.  I work a block from this location, so I have been there at least a dozen times. While not great, it is something different once in awhile, so I put in an appearance now and then. The food is not bad, per se, it is just not that good. The prices, on the other hand, are far too high for what you get. $11 gets you a ""large sandwich"" which is not very large, an order of fries, and a soda--RC brands. For a couple of bucks more I could get a combo platter at Famous Daves.  Service is all business. I dont think I have ever seen a smile in the place. But it is fast. The place is usually dirty, but I am usually there right around lunch, so it might be better other times.  Just not impressed at all. But...it beats the Burger King down the street which is the worst BK in Christendom. But that is another review."
3,"Cave Creek is a well-manicured muni, featuring a straight-forward layout, nice practice area and large putting green.  There are some elevation changes and some bunkering that add some challenge, but overall its a pretty easy course. Some of the better holes are #5, a dogleg right with no room to drive it left (slopes into a hazard), and large green with some tricky pin positions if the flag is in the back.  #8 is a long par four with a narrow driving area and a challenging approach featuring a narrow chute to the green that will most likely need to be hit with a mid-to-long iron (#1 handicap).  #11 is a par 5 that forces you consider fairway metal off the tee, as a driver hit over 260 yds and to the right could likely find a water hazard, and anything left is completely dead.  My personal favorite hole is #18, a short four par with a carry over a ravine from the tee to an uphill, dogleg left fairway with a slope on the left side and a reachable fairway bunker.   Most of the greens here are fairly large, so lag putting will come into play.  There arent any tricks here - it can suit fairway-green style and the bomb-and-gouge crowd.  The driving range desperately needs new balls, but the course is a solid three stars."
4,Best Thai food Ive eaten in the Phoenix area.
5,"Hands down the best spa I have visited in the state and perhaps the nation.  Massages were amazing. Drinks and brunch were amazing. Staff went out of their way to take care of our every need. Went at 11 am to relax for the day and stayed until 5pm which is unheard of for me at a spa once the initial massage has taken place, but this place kept me going all afternoon with the plunge pool, sauna and steam. Also, the pool and spa hot tube outside were amazing. I honestly cannot say enough about AJi and its wonderful staff. I will return"
5,"Yes, the place is busy every time I go there, and it takes 20 minutes or so to get your order Yes, the inside is cheesy and cheap with folding tables and could definitely use a makeover Yes, the location is...ummm...well lets just say its a ""working class neighborhood"" BUT theyve got the best fish tacos Ive ever had, and everything on their Mexico City street food style menu is outstanding. The $1 tacos are ""mini-tacos"" so get 3 or 4 of them, a couple of fish tacos, maybe a side of rice and/or beans and you will be all set. Go there. Just leave yourself plenty of time, its well worth the wait."
1,"This is a sad excuse for a gay resort.  Sort of like a worn out version of Palm Springs.  We found the Zen Yard up on Maryland Avenue a much more agreeable experience in a better neighborhood as well.  Zen Yard is a far better value, with full breakfasts included and warm, helpful hosts as well, not to mention particularly reasonable off-season rates and hosts who are actually there for their guests."
4,"Im just glad that they brought back the Strawberry ""fields"" salad.  Yummo!  Fresh greens, goat cheese, fresh strawberries, bell peppers, onions, glazed pecans, chicken and this amazing viniagrette dressing! Wowwy Mowwy!  Oh, and it comes with a crusty buttery cheesy bread.  I have had a few run ins with bad waiter service, but the manager was always quick to come by our table to ask if anything else was needed.  As long as I get what I ordered and I dont have to poke around their tables to make ""eye contact"" with my server Im ok.  They know they will get a mideocre tip if their service is so-so.  Its on them.  My mother got a red velvet cupcake on the house for her birthday! That was nice."
5,"I never write these things. But I have to say that you will not be disappointed with Paletas Betty. Especially with the weather right now, it is a delicious and healthy treat, made with seasonal ingredients. I highly recommend the limón amarillo when in season. Delicious frozen lemondade/lemon drop on a stick, tossed in a sugar rub. It is for certain served in heaven. That is all. P.S. check out the hours, yo. You know whats up."
5,"Quick, friendly, awesome."
5,"Amazing. Fogo de chao is nothing short of out of this world. It is expensive, but as soon as you start, youll know exactly where that money went. Seriously. Try it."
5,"Ever eat at a Steak n Shake?  Thats what Freddys is: a Steak N Shake kind of burger and its delicious!  I liked the fries too: very thin, perfectly hot, not too much salt. Nice people, the manager made it a point to get me my meal hot-off-the-grill, even though I came ahead of the ""call"" and again he met me while he was cleaning tables.  {See my review of ""The Habit"": their manager never greets customers, cant solve problems from behind a door, always hiding in his office.}  Freddys Manager was OUTFRONT, ALL THE TIME, WORKING HARD!   Great burger.  Next time Ill get the frozen custard.  I was too full from my triple cheese, CALIFORNIA STYLE-BABY!"
5,"had a ""cap steak"" for the first time. Best steak i have ever had.  Would recommend to anyone."
2,"Im always searching for quality food at a fair price for lunch.  There are tons of sit down expensive lunch places and lots of fast food (junk food) places too.  When I read the reviews on Chestnut Lane I hustled right on over.  The concept is right on but the execution leaves a LOT to be desired.   First challenge is getting a parking place and I was lucky.  The line to order didnt look too bad when I arrived so i was feeling lucky.  However, the line took forever to move forward causing the people waiting to shuffle back and forth in a very confined space as there was lots of foot traffic trying to enter and exit.  The woman at the register took each order, processed the payment, and then proceeded to prepare the drinks  and sides for each order.  The drinks are somewhat specialty items and are kind of labor intensive, especially considering that the order line is at a total standstill.  SLOW!  After way too long a wait, I finally was able to order...then the real wait began!  It was a good 25 minutes before my order came up and it was just a TURKEY SANDWICH!  I felt lucky, though, as the woman ahead of me in line was still waiting for her SANDWICH after I had finished mine and was driving away! Sometimes a long wait is mitigated by the awesomeness of the food.  Well, at Chestnut Lane this is unfortunately not the case.  I mean it was a decent turkey sandwich, but when I saw the almost $16 charge for a TURKEY SANDWICH and ICED TEA I was expecting something fabulous.  It wasnt all that.   If you decide to go to Chestnut Lane, maybe you could park in the spacious Jack-in-the Box lot just to the east.  And grab a Breakfast Jack to hold you over during your long wait!"
3,"After checking into our lovely suite at the Montelucia my hubby said he was in the mood for some chips, guac and a margarita. I think he had mistaken Scottsdale for Mexico and unfortunately the restaurant at The Montelucia (Prado) had none of the above. Instead we enjoyed a glass of wine (Riesling for me), a bowl of gazpacho and shared the snapper ceviche.  Service was a bit on the slow side, but the tasty food made up for it... We ended up back at Prado the next morning for breakfast- we were quite starving after hiking Camelback (or part of Camelback).  I was a bit disappointed with their breakfast menu. They had very few things to choose from besides the $25 breakfast buffet. I wasnt in a buffet kind of mood, but it didnt seem like we had a choice. However, I seemed to get the most out of my $25 after stuffing my face with an omlette, mini breakfast burrito, fruit, yogurt parfait, etc.  Our waiter did a bit of a disappearing act, but fortunately we didnt need him much for the buffet. They do have some good food, but they could use some more options...and better service."
4,"Ive been to corporate events, concerts and Spring Training games here, and Ive been consistently surprised at how well they do what they do.   First the field.  At Spring training games you are so close you feel like youre watching a little league game.  The grass is go green it almost looks fake (its not).  And the backdrop of office and apartment buildings is decidedly suburban.  I finally get the big draw.   Next - the vendors. Taco in a bag (must experience to believe).  Strawberries and banana dipped in chocolate on a stick.  Great pizza.  Amazing choices of beer.  Oh, if only they had a selection of soda the way they had a selection of beer.   Parking is plentiful and the grounds are always kept neat.  Folks who work there have all been helpful and friendly.  It may feel like its forever away from our Phoenix core, but its not to far for an experience that BOB or Chase Field could never provide."
5,This place is so good! I have eaten almost everything on the menu. It is not the fanciest of places but it is great to go with friends and buy a ton of delicious food for very little money. I would recommend this place I go often.
4,"Always packed on wing night, which can sometimes make for slow service, but that is to be expected. I love their wings, even if they are kind of small, but who can complain for $0.39? Pizza is good too. And the pizza cookie dessert, omg, druelz."
3,"Wow, it must be a first-time mall experience for the reviewer before me.  Five stars for Arrowhead?  Are you kidding? I find this mall to be average and boring with many middle of the road stores (Dillards, Sears, Gap, Tillys, Forever 21) you can find elsewhere at other Westcor malls in the Valley.    Nothing really strikes me as distinctive at this mall - other than the fact that its the nicer of two indoor shopping malls on the Westside.  So for 500,000 people this is the only game in town unless theyre willing to drive east. The store mix and food court are pretty typical.  In fact, I rarely go here unless I am in the area, need socks or undershirts and/or Im trying to avoid the lines of the other Arrowhead Paradise Bakery."
5,"Mmm!  Delicious Indian food and a great selection of vegetarian dishes. I LOVE the fact that each dish is mildly spiced, and left up to the individual to customize the flavor depending on which sauces they choose.  Im a spicy lightweight so it was great that I didnt have to worry about getting something too hot to enjoy. I had a bowl of brown rice, cumin potatoes and tofu masala with a cool yogurt-cucumber-mint sauce on the side.  It was fantastic!  I cant wait to go back. ...also, I thought it was adorable that we were given a golden dollar coin with our check for ""making the drive to their location and to compensate for high-gas prices"".  A memorable gesture!"
4,"I always have good time at this place.  I could write a page about Geisha, but the previous reviews pretty much sum this place up.       *   Self servicing bathrooms (Ladies only)      *   Fantastic Happy Hour pricing- The veggie pot stickers are the bomb!     *   Hot waitresses ... barely of age to serve you alcohol =)     *   Private karaoke rooms that allow you to humiliate yourself in front of your friends only The only thing I would steer clear of is the specialty drinks they are overly sweet and are not made with fresh fruit... even when they say they are. The waitress cleared that up for me last weekend =)."
3,"A group of us were there for drinks late Saturday night, the bar is really cool, well thought out and decorated. Drink menu, cocktails and draft beers are all exceptional. Only challenge was it was almost impossible to get the attention of the bar staff, I am not sure that since we were a large group and had a tab running that only one batman could serve us but it was really frustrating having bar staff just ignore us! Other wise the place is great........"
3,"tip: if ordering in the drive thru - either there is no speaker system or its out of order - when the person wearing an apron walks up to the side of the menu and stares into your car that means ""Hi, can I take your order"" There was a few seconds of awkward silence and wondering WTH this person was looking in the car for before we figured out she was there to take our order :) Since moving to the west valley from southern CA weve been itchin to find a replacement for Albertos or Taco San Pedro. Humbertos reminds me of awesome hole in the wall type Mexican food, but unfortunately still leaves something to be desired. With that said heres info on what we had: If youre from So Cal and have had Northgates shrimp ceviche Humbertos comes awfully close.  Verdict - Ceviche - good. Cheese quesadilla - cheesy - did the job Nachos - good If youve been out late partying it up and need to satisfy the munchies monster Humbertos should do."
3,"Its an upscale casual restaurant with nice decor- 4 star, a quick meal before or after shopping. A quick meal means only if you get good sever plus quick service. We went to have brunch on Sunday and it was pretty packed in there. After looked at their simple brunch menu, we decided to get Grilled Hanger Steak with Scrambled Eggs, and Cinnamon French Toast with Fruit Compote & Syrup($8.50).  It wasnt too impressive, the food was just ok- 3 Star. I think you pay more for the ambiance than the dishes. The service was alright- 3 Star. It felt like you are in the market with chit chat and bargain noise, which i thought it was kinda annoying."
4,"I eat lunch here sometimes.  The chips are always a little on the burned side and need tons of salt.  Ive learned from experience that this just goes better with the salsa there.  Besides, these chips are real.  Not some gigantic bag of factory chips laying on some heating tray in the back.  They killed those tortillas this morning, in boiling oil.  Seriously, the first bite not capture your imagination but youll slowly find yourself wondering why you cant stop eating them. They have daily specials, my favorite of which is the chicken mole which is Thursdays I believe.  Im also a sucker for Fridays chille relleno.  If Im there on some other less glorious day, Ill opt for the cheese enchilada plate or the Clare burro.  Try the ice tea.  Its got cinnamon in it and it doesnt taste a thing like Liptons."
5,"I love the story time program here! I started coming this summer after having a baby and wanting to get my toddler out of the house while beating the heat. The staff here is amazing! It is a 30 minute session of singing, dancing, stories and bubbles. We look forward to this every week now. My daughter loves the take home cut out and coloring sheet. The first thing she does is come home and color it. I am so thankful for this free program."
1,"I havent yelped in about 2 months, and I was waiting for a place to either wow me or disgust me.  Well, this place was that bad.  First impressions were all right -- the outside bar was neat w/ good views of downtown, and the fire pits were nice.  No beers on tap though; and seriously, whats with the hip-hop club DJ at 7:00 pm?  Come on guys, way too early for that. It wasnt too long before three of us were seated; and after about 10 minutes, our waitress came up and asked us whether we were ready to ... oh wait, thats right, no menus yet, good job.  O.k., so I ordered the Thai Spring rolls, which had a filling of lettuce, a single strip of carrot, and noodles.  Seriously?!  Main course, I ordered the curry, which turned out to be the worst curry in the world -- I dont even know if it was curry; it was more like a bowl of thick, yellow soup, with a few pieces of chicken and a couple of vegetables tossed in.  Yuck.  And then they only gave me a tiny bowl of rice.  Im sorry, isnt it supposed to be the other way around?  My friends completely agreed with how bad the place was (I think they had some sort of stir fry, which they said was bland and pointless). So yeah, I dont recommend this place.  Instead, head a block over to The Roosevelt for some good beer on tap and some pretty good food."
4,"I usually try to stay away from the Arizona Mills mall. The mall itself has gotten crappier by the minute. Now, since I work close by, I was forced to go back to venture to Paradise Bakery. I honestly did not get my hopes up. Since it was lunch time, it was not busy at all. Nothing is worse that being on your work lunch, starving, and standing in line. I opted for the Chicken Walnut Sandwich, with a cup of Tomato Soup.  The sandwich was delicious and fresh. The bread was perfect as was the chicken walnut salad. You know...sometimes chicken salad can get really gross..slimey..salty...yucky. This one was perfect and the walnuts added a delicious crunch. On to the soup. First off, I L-O-V-E tomato soup. It is my favorite. Would almost consider taking a bath in it. Hehehe...well, ok maybe not. BUT this soup rocked my socks off. Perfectly creamy, with a hint of smoky flavor, a small drizzle of sour cream and a few crunchy tortilla strips. YUM. So, venture there to try the soup but scurry fast and take the food with you. Dont eat there. Take it somewhere, where you can have a moment alone with the soup.  Finito."
5,"Best cajun food in town, not just from a truck.  Phoenix doesnt have the greatest selection of cajun offerings so I was amazed at Food Truck Friday to find Jamburrito.  They have a pretty stellar selection of meats & meals considering its from a truck. The spices were perfect - just spicy enough to enjoy but nothing thats going to harm.  I had the catfish once and the jamburrito twice... not in one sitting because the portions are VERY filling."
5,"first time my friend and I went there... it was delicious!  The food, garlic knots our favorite and of course the wine!  We will be going back ALOT!"
5,"First off, I am not a Cubs fan.  But I came here to watch them play the As during spring training and thought this park rocked.  Its cozy enough get within heckling distance of the players, but it has a lot of the amenities of Wrigley Field...including Old Style beer and florescent green hot dog relish.  All this and sunshine too!  Whats not to like?"
4,"This should be called a speakeasy coffee shop. Why? Because you really have to be told about it to really know its there! The shop has minimal signage on the exterior and its housed within a urban multi-use warehouse on Roosevelt with different vendors and an art space. I can only imagine how cool this building must be to visit during First Fridays! Once inside, I was pretty surprised that the coffee shop is more spacious than I would have figured. Its pretty sparse inside, but there were plenty of seats to do some work or have a meeting.  The coffee here is strong and delicious. After drinking my non-fat iced latte, I had to refrain myself from bouncing off the walls! Its definitely coffee with a kick if you need a wake-up call.  This coffee shop definitely exudes the epitome of cool and I will definitely keep it on my list for a caffeinated visit in the future."
4,"My boyfriend and I came here this past Friday night for dinner as we had both drive by the place quite often and have been wanting to try it out.  The service was great and I liked the wide open space. We tried two different beer samples for a $1 each and settled on splitting a pitcher of Levitation which we both enjoyed. We ordered the green chile dip appetizer. I ordered the shrimp tacos and my boyfriend ordered the brisket. He LOVED the brisket and after taking a bite of it, I could see why. It was quite good. My shrimp tacos however, were so bland that I barely ate half of my meal. And it was a ""small plate."" I wasnt the biggest fan of our appetizer but after tasting my dinner, I decided I liked the dip a lot more and finished it off. Definitely do not recommend the shrimp tacos. One annoying thing was our meals came out right after our appetizer. A little time in between would have been good - but Ill take that over slow service any day.  Im giving this place four stars because of how great the brisket was and despite not liking my dish, I had a great time and think this place has lots of potential. Ill be back to try something else!"
4,"Aww, too bad these guys went out of business.  I actually only went there one time, I live in Chandler, so its just a little out of the way.  But I stopped through the drive-thru and thought if I lived near-by this would be my coffee place.  Whoever took my order that day was very friendly."
3,"I think the Living Room is fine! Like another reviewer said, its nothing particularly exciting or mind blowing, but it is a nice neighborhood restaurant that has solid food. I like some of their bruschetta options more than Postinos.  I do agree that the music is too loud! The atmosphere is more ambient and I wish the music was commensurate with that. I always forget my servers name but he is very nice and helpful - no complaints there!"
4,"I give Rivas 4 stars because of the secret top burrito in town which is the California burrito and have them put a chilli relleno in the burrito which is the best of all worlds.  So basically this burrito consists of carne asada, potatoes, pico de gallo, cheese and a chilli relleno all wrapped up in a delicious tortilla.  Once you add some hot sauce to that it equals one of the best burritos in town.  I learned of this only because of one of the employees telling me to get it this way because all the people that work there eat it this way.  You have to try it!"
4,"We got passes for the preview of Mission Impossible (Ghost Protocol).  We enjoyed the movie a lot.  The theater itself is fine.  The chairs dont move, and you cant raise the arm rests.  No rocking, no reclining (granted most theater seats dont move a lot, but these dont move at all).  Otherwise the seats were reasonably comfortable.  The screen is IMAX (i.e. huge), and the sound was reasonably good.   They could have put a little more slope into the auditorium seating.  In other IMAX theaters Ive been in it seemed the heads of people in front of you NEVER block any portion of the screen.  But I found a few were just slightly into the bottom of the screen.  It wasnt bad, but given my other IMAX experiences I did notice it."
5,"Having spent lots of time in Sonora, Mexico over the years visiting family, I have always sought a place here in Arizona that provides an honest and quality duplication of the food I have had south of the border. At Sonora Mesquite Grill, I have found such a place that makes food on the spot, using only fresh ingredients, and genuine care for your experience. You can always go elsewhere and maybe get your food faster, maybe have a plasma TV in your face, but Im willing to bet that your food started out frozen and going through a thawing process in a microwave.  Celina, the kind and welcoming owner, wants people to receive the absolute best food possible. This painstaking process means long hours for her every day preparing the beef and chicken over a mesquite fire. No, there are no large corporate chain gimmicks or cut corners. Sonora Mesquite Grill simply provides good food at a good price without the use of preservatives and loads of fat. Is Sonora Mesquite Grill for everyone? Perhaps not, but it is a great choice for someone looking for genuinely authentic, modest, great tasting and healthy food with the taste of Sonora.  If going for the first time, make sure to order the silky and flavorful guacamole and salsas. Finish your meal with a fresh and homemade razpado to truly cap off a great meal at Sonora Mesquite Grill. Simple and great flavors at their very best."
4,"If its cold, creamy ,sweet, and I can put many a topping of choice on it and its fat free and low calories, Im all in. Golden spoon is this and more. Simply delicious flavors and all around good. Need I say more?"
2,"Been to this place only once.  Coming from Chicago the experience at this place was ok, but Ive had much better.  Would not go again since I think there are better places out here."
4,"Great food and atmosphere. Had lunch there on a Friday afternoon. Parking is a bit of a challenge. Had the pork pita which had onions, bell peppers, and pepper jack cheese...awesome... The burgers are good too! The service was excellent."
5,"Mouth watering. Thats all I have to say. The food at this place is seriously amazing. Everything we tasted was better than the dish before it, and we had a fabulous bottle of white wine to accompany our meal. The scallops were a highlight, as was the potato pie dish (thats not a very technical name for what it was, but thats my best effort). It was all very, very good, and the only thing keeping us from returning is the cost! We genuinely enjoyed our evening here, and we will absolutely go back, but it is pricey, especially for the size of the dishes. The atmosphere and ambiance are so fun, and this place is a little dressier and trendier than some other places weve been in Scottsdale. I highly recommend this for a night out with friends, or a cool date night. It seemed as though reservations would be a good idea, although we didnt have them and were okay (it was busy, though)."
5,"Yeah it was good. My wife & I went with 2 other foodie couples, who are good friends, for our monthly ""side dish"" function.  The food was all fantastic.  All 5 of the other people in our group were drinking martinis, which they all said were very tasty as well, but at $12-$16 per, Im a little put off.  Im more of a beer guy anyway, so I had a couple of craft-brews that are not available everywhere, and then settled on a Firestone DBA -- a very very tasty beer -- and had several of those.  Great food, great booze, club music atmosphere is pretty cool. Outdoor area is excellent. Felt like an idiot when I had to ask where the mens room was only to turn around and find that the huge wall of a door was right behind me and said ""he"" in huge letters on the bottom of the door.  Oh and then (6 or 7 strong beers into the evening) I found that the mirror next to the (only) urinal in the mens room misled me into believing there was a second urinal, which I tried unsuccessfully to walk to.  Why is that guy walking directly toward me?  Oh, its me.  In the mirror. Dumbass.  So then (after relieving myself in the actual urinal) I go back out to the table to tell the story about trying to use the urinal in the mens room that doenst exist, and somebody else says ""yeah the same fucking thing happened to me too!"" so I dont feel like such a dumbass anymore.  Fun night."
3,"I was craving something last night and couldnt figure out what I wanted. I happened to stumble across this place and decided to give it a try. I ordered the house fried rice and some crab rangoon. Now the crab rangoon were pretty good and I was actually bummed that you only got four but it was only about $2.50 so I cannot complain too much. The fried rice was just ok. For it to be house friend rice, which comes with beef, chicken, pork and shrimp, I can understand not having alot of the shrimp but it didnt have much of anything. I mean it tasted ok, but I was hoping for a little bit more meat than there was. It was a quick meal considering I didnt really know what I wanted to eat anyway. I may give it another try and hope that its a little better next time."
5,"I couldnt wait to get home and yelp this place. Five stars, too!  After a (raw chicken) bad experience some 13 years ago, I hadnt been to Bandera until tonight. WOW! It was a GREAT experience!!!  We started off with a grilled artichoke which was fabulous!  Both of us had the Texas Hill Country Ribs which came with cole slaw (not your ordinary cole slaw) and the most delish matchstick fries.  Unfortunately, I dont eat seeds and nuts (peanuts in the cole slaw...my husband loved it) but the very polite and wonderful server, Sarah, offered some other sides and I picked the braised red cabbage, which came with a little goat cheese on the top which was to die-for delish!! Home made wonderful braised red cabbage!  The entire meal was SUPERB! The service was phenomenal, and we were lucky enough to sit by the kitchen and see all of the dishes come out...they all looked YUMMY!  I am so happy that my neighbor suggested Banderas ribs, and will go back frequently as you can tell this place is run as a tight ship. Everyone is polished, polite and efficient! The food is an experience in perfection, and the service tip top! Next time, Ill take some pictures (if Im not too hungry)...  I dont think its a shorts and jeans type of place but a dressy/casual type of place, if you know what I mean... REALLY EXCELLENT FOOD!"
5,"Holy frijoles- this place lived up to the hype. Im surprised how how good the pizza is here in Arizona. Very tasty, and definitely some of the best pizza Ive had in the valley. The only downside is that there is usually a long wait to be seated, and then once your seated, it takes a longer wait for your pizza. The prices are average, the service was so-so, but the food was excellent! Nice location too, right in Old Town so you can have a drink at a nearby bar while you wait for your table. Cool place for date-night, or to have dinner with family. Its fairly casual, but charming at the same time."
4,Very nice views of Phoenix.  Not a very challenging hike but very enjoyable. Gets steep at the very top but a couple of hard steps will get you to a nice view
3,"The people who are either stocking the shelves, cleaning the floors, or behind the counter have all been polite so far. I have nothing really bad to say, but nothing really great either. Keep perservering...maybe Ill write another review when something outrageous happens :)"
5,"Woohoo is right. My hubby and I have gone a few times for happy hour and always enjoyed ourselves. Last night was the best so far. We were enjoying a few Left Hands and ordered the Tuesday night pizza special. It was 2 for 1 basically so we each ordered our fave. Apparently the GM thought my pizza was too done so he brought out the "" burnt"" one and already had another one cooking. I actually like my pizza that way but hey, I could understand where he was coming from. The second pizza was beautiful, a work of art. My husbands pie was great, all he kept saying was how great the crust was. I wil definitely bring all my friends and clients here. Special service too!  thanks again to Dan the general manager and our delicious server Reina ( sorry there isnt a better word,is there?)            Linda and Ron"
2,"My bf and I drove in from ""the city"" lol and met some friends here for brunch.  We didnt have to wait long to get seated which was great.  The waitress came and took our drink order and right away she didnt seem too thrilled.  So I ordered an omelet and asked for turkey sausage instead of the toast or pancakes it came with, she looked at me like I was asking for a cure to cancer and proceeded to tell me that I would have to be charged full-price.  Well duh, I kinda figured and since I asked it was probably ok.  Needless to say, we waited 30 mins to get our food, which we had to ask her for.  My omelet was cold, I didnt get the turkey sausage I had ordered but she did add it to the check.  Thank god we had a groupon or else it would have been a total loss.  The Breakfast Club in Old Town is better!"
4,absolutely love this place. It is a fru-fru hang out joint that isnt pretentious.  The cucumber lemonade has become my favorite non-alcoholic drink and their bruschetta is always the best!
5,"I live in LA where these shops are on every corner.  I can say without a doubt, this is the best FroYo Ive had! On top of that, the store staff is super-friendly and the place is immaculately clean.  They are also serving gelato, pastries and fresh coffee/espresso.  Check it out!"
1,Not a company to do business with ... From my experience !
3,"The food is good, but I think the prices are too high for what you get.  Considering there are plenty of other places to go for good subs, salads and fruit platters that would be much cheaper, its hard to choose Duck and Decanter over them. However, I will go here when I dont have to pay.  Why not, right?"
3,"So I went here twice and I hated it the first time.  I dont know if I got a bad cut of meat or what, but my burrito was a bit too fatty.  I think it was the red chile burrito, or something. Having said that, I recently gave it another shot and and went for the carne asada burrito.  Very, very good.  The cut of the beef is a little thicker than the usual Salazars or Filibertos burrito, but it was really good regardless.  Oh, and the beans in there were awesome, too.  It didnt have guacamole and I didnt notice till it was too late, but Ill be sure to get some in there next time. Overall, I give it 3 stars because i really hated my first visit, but their carne asada is completely legit."
4,"I continue to give Golden Egg Roll 4 stars.  I love the house chicken and schezwan chicken (Im sure I misspelled that).  I did not like the Hunan chicken; however, I despise bell peppers and didnt realize they were in this meal until after I got it.  Golden Egg Roll became a regular place for me to go to because it was cheap and better than decent.  Now that Ive moved, Im going to miss this place."
3,"This is a great place to have a casual meal.  Its obviously a pub atmosphere but its large enough to accommodate a lot of people without it getting crowded.  They also have many well placed flat screen tvs. (I just wish they would turn on the closed captioning!  Its one thing if youre watching a sporting event but when they have on an analysis show I want to hear the analysis!)   My husband had the beer sampler and enjoyed most of the varieties, the Raj IPA was his favorite (the 8th Street Ale and Kiltlifter are the more popular ones).  We had the soft pretzel appetizer which was ok, but Im spoiled when it comes to pretzels having lived in Philly and lived on them for my entire college career.   I wish it came with a honey mustard to dip in and not just regular spicy mustard.  I had the French Dip which was solid - not the best Ive had but still pretty good.  My husband had the Tap Room Tenderloin sandwich that he enjoyed - the onion straws and bleu cheese were a nice touch. Now this is just stupid.  (Saturday, 4/13)   Ring ring ring. . . ""Hello, Four Peaks"" ""Hi, will you be showing the Red Sox/Yankees game?"" ""Yes, definitely."" ""Even though its being blacked out?"" ""Blacked out?"" ""Yeah, Fox wont be showing the game because the Diamondbacks game is on at the same time.  Youre getting an east coast feed?  From NY or Boston?"" ""Feed?"" ""Yeah, you know, youre getting the broadcast from the Fox affiliate in NY or Boston?"" "". . .Um. . .well definitely be showing the game. . ."" ""Ok. . .""   Drive to Four Peaks ""Hello! Welcome to Four Peaks!  Table for 2?"" ""Yeah, somewhere we can see the Sox/Yankees game."" ""Oh sorry, its being blacked out"" ""What?!  But I called 15 minutes ago and you said you were showing it!"" ""No sorry, that Diamondbacks game is on at the same time so were not getting the Sox/Yankees game"" ""THATS WHAT I SAID ON THE PHONE AND YOU SAID YOU WERE SHOWING IT!"" ""Oh, well do you know who you talked to?"" ""It wasnt you?!  I dont know!  Some moron who said youd be showing the game!""   Youre not getting my business if you blatantly lie to me just to get me in the door."
5,"My fiancé took his pediatric boards yesterday and that calls for a no-more-studying-at-coffee-shops-during-dinner celebration! We are brand new to Phoenix and these last few months have been eating lots of Mexican and some more Mexican, which we are not complaining about in the least, but it was time for something different. Our neighbor recommended Richardsons/Rokerij as his favorite so I made a reservation for Monday night. We sat in their downstairs dining room tucked in a generous booth in the back corner. My fiancé ordered a Dark and Stormy and we split a bottle of Pinot Noir as our server informed us of their 1/2 price bottles of wine deal. Hurrah! We ordered 2 appetizers: the bacon-wrapped scallops and the crab-stuffed mushrooms. One bite of the scallops and we were in heaven. They were GIANT, perfectly cooked, and beautifully placed in a pool of amazingly different dipping sauces. You can never go wrong with wrapping bacon on a piece of, well, anything, but this appetizer was magical. My fiancé ordered the Rokerij Steak with roasted corn and mashed sweet potatoes in a chili pepper. Im not a steak lover, but took one bite of his dish and it melted in my mouth. Fantastic. I ordered the Swordfish special with roasted eggplant and mashed sweet potatoes in the chili pepper as well, and I devoured every bite!  What did it for me, however, was the dessert. We shared the truffle with vanilla gelato topped with berries. The truffles were like buttery brownies in a hard shell and perfectly portioned to satisfy. Very memorable. We will be back, even if its just for the truffles!"
4,"A short an sweet report about lunch.... This was a quick lunch with my best friend Melissa and was well worth it!!   We were greeted by the counter person with a warm welcome and when I advised I had never been here before, she took me through a quick tour of the menu and suggested what to order.  Following her suggestions was a great choice!   We both had the same thing, The Hawaiian BBQ Mix.  This comes with BBQ Chicken, BBQ Beef and Kalbi Short Ribs.  I also added Teriyaki sauce to the Chicken.  The meals came with 2 scoops of rice, a single scoop of macaroni salad and veg.   The flavors were wonderful, the beat tender and juicy.  The ribs were a thin slide and you had to navigate around the bones but it was delicious! For months I have been threatening to stop by but never have,  Now I am sad for all I have missed!!  Definitely going back!!   Overall:  This place is a keeper!  Good service, great food, served fairly quickly....We are already making plans for your next visit!  Enjoy!"
4,Best basic $12 in/exterior wash i got in a while. Didnt even have to tell them to wipe down anything.
2,"What more can I say except it is over priced, greasy Mexican food! I have had better in Texas, the only thing that saved them from being a one star is their great salsa!"
1,"I will never make another purchase from this company ever again! The company tried to deliver damaged furniture to my home and then gave me the run around about processing a refund when I refused to accept the items. After 5 phone conversations, they agreed to refund me for refusing damaged items. I cannot recommend this to anyone."
1,"I usually do not write reviews, but was so horrified by my experience I had to. Went for a late night bite and drink with a friend, they were fairly busy so we had a seat at the bar. As I frequent The Moon often, I was happy to see the bar was busy as well. The bartender quickly came over and was noticably intoxicated, as she could not even tell me the flavors of vodka they had. We ordered our drinks, and watched as she broke glass into the ice, knocked over glassware and broke a beer bottle. As we looked around most of the guests had the same look of horror on their face. We decided to order some food, as she spilled my drink on us (refilled it with something completely different) and she could barely even talk at this point. We saw management watch her behavior and do nothing, as she preceded to grab dirty glassware and refill it with beer. I was so appauled by this we left befpre finishing our drinks or food. Im not sure what she was on but if its visible to paying customers it should be visible to management. Being beyond embarassed for the establishment, I would doubt I will come back, sad as we would frequent the Moon 2-3 times a week. Horrible."
4,"A definite four stars, the focus on fresh food and a great breakfast has build a strong following at this destination location in Scottsdale Civic Center. now that i think about it how can i not give this place a 5 stars theirs way to much creativity and freshnewssness in the fruit, veg and the nectar of the gods, Coffee, all packed into one nice bright orange place.   Old Town has a few breakfast spots but this is one you have to find.  can i say I hope to see this as a Scottsdale yelp ""hidden gem."" As for my last meal I had the prosciutto melt and it went past expectations, the fresh basil really added the extra taste.   Service was ok, a typical cafe style, the restaurant does not seek to be over pertinacious, the look is clean and the cafe is a really nice touch with options to order and go.    So many Little restaurants like this keeps me looking for the next one.  Dont forget for later in the night AZ 88 is just down a few steps.   Happy breakfast, Kevin PS there seems to be some kind of yelp trend, does a hand full of yelps make a difference in a restaurant, does that have a yelp definition when this happens."
4,"Totally fantastic.  I love to stop by here whenever I am in Phoenix for their pork sandwich -- which is great. I especially like the barbecue sauce that they use.  I hear on good authority that many other menu items are good, but I cant tear myself away from the the pulled pork sandwich. They also do a really tasty potato salad, sweet potato pie, and cobbler."
4,"Midday parking at this place is seriously a joke, but such is the case with a lot of swank midtown lunch spots.  Pizza was great, my East Coast hailing girlfriend gave it a thumbs up, which for an AZ pizza place is a huge kudos. We came to check out both this and the adjoining Pink Spot Coffee and Ice cream. We ate on the ice cream side, so I cant comment much on the decor of the Z Pizza side.  Good ingredients, not the usual suspects, so that is a change. I will pay for good quality pizza, so the price was in line for the quality of the food. It did a ton of lunch business but was efficient and the staff was smiling and not hating their life, which is always pleasant ."
5,I really like this place... they have great wine... try the tasting... it is 10 bucks and you get 5 tastes... they make almost all of the wine in house (i know the almond champagne is not made there)... i have not found any wine that i dont like... my favorite is their porto and chocolate port. the other thing you can do is have a bottling party.  i recently purchased 30 bottles (at a great price!!!  cheaper then the wine stores).  they make the batch for you and then you have a party to bottle and label it.  this is a great and fun different party for you are your friends.   despite it location it is a great place for a date...
4,"Really great finds. Helped me stock a vintage 60s bar.  Ron is very helpful and knows where everything is in the store.  Great at finding knick nacks such as distressed wood, door knobs, irons, kitchen wares, etc.  Something for everyone."
5,"ive never had a problem getting assistance here, except when its busy, usually on a sat/sun. its not that far from the house, maybe a mile, so i if im in a real bind, i come on by here to pick up some stuff.  theyve offered groupons here and with those, ive bought some power tools and hardware. ace brand is cheaper price but the quality seems to be just as good!"
1,This location is now closed.
2,"Being the only gay bar in Scottsdale aside from BS West, Ive found myself at Forbidden a few times.  Forbidden is an ambitious concept--a gay club with two rooms and two deejays in a city not known for its gay nightlife. Sadly Forbidden does not deliver.   The club is usually pretty busy on a Saturday night, but the crowd leaves a bit to be desired.  The patrons are mostly unattractive, kind of trashy in fact, and not very friendly.   I believe deejay in the main room does not change on the weekends, where he spins top 40 dance/pop to a drunk college-aged crowd.  In the OZ room (the smaller room) they have different local deejays, who, from what Ive seen, spin a variety of different types of music--sometimes its circuity music, sometimes its eighties music, it all depends on the deejay for that night.  The OZ room has been pretty empty the few times Ive been there.  The sound system in both rooms leaves quite a bit to be desired from a place that calls itself a club.   The drinks are reasonably priced for a bar in Scottsdale.   The décor is okay, but not very interesting.  Forbidden isnt terrible.  It is, however, just plain boring (bad music on a bad sound system, uninteresting décor, and an unimpressive and unfriendly crowd)!"
3,Ok.  Not great for what is supposedly a good steak joint.  Not much ambiance and food was good not great.
2,"When I was younger and first moved to Arizona, Serranos on Rural Road became a family tradition to get mexican food. It was basically all I knew till adulthood. If I would have reviewed this place 10 years ago, it would have been 5 stars but now the blinders are off and I have money to try better places. One by one they all seem to dwarf Serranos in most every way. I feel kinda guilty writing this and hope my family does not read this :) But it has to be said. I would still eat at Serranos but it doesnt have the same feeling anymore. The Chimichangas are good and their bean dip is awesome. Nothing I have had is gross or anything but its just   basic greasy mexican food. There are better places out there. Once again to any family reading this....Im sorry :)"
3,"Threw a friends baby shower here and it went pretty smoothly. We made reservations well in advance, and it was a small party. Im not a huge fan of their food but its always busy so clearly other people dont have my same opinion. The three stars is for the service, they were super attentive and everything was taken care of for our party. I just dont think the cheesecake is that great, Im sorry! But the apps arent too bad."
2,"If Im rating strictly on getting what I wanted out of the visit, this doctor is fine.  He checked my eyes, did all of the tests and I walked out with my prescription. Here is why I cant give him a good review (and this is solely based on my personality and preferences while dealing with the service industry- others may think hes wonderful...) 1)  I purposely chose an early morning (7:30 a.m.) appointment so that I would get to work by 9.  My office is less than a mile from his office and I was still running into work at 9:05 a.m.  This is due to the very long-winded soap-box like speech that Dr. Greene gave me.  I am a get-in, get-out type of person who hates small talk and hates self-promotion even more and if I heard him tell me how often he visits the gym or works out one more time, I probably would have gauged my eyes out right there to never need an optometrist again.  I also learned all about his wife, friends boat...you name it...he told me about it (completely unsolicited). 2)  I am an educated individual who does not need an hour-long explanation- filled with graphical references and cutesy anecdotes- about why I now need progressive lenses. 3)  The fear-inducing sales pitch by the staff and the doctor was a bit much.  I realize that all optometrists and dentists are going this route now- ""buy this test (not covered by insurance) and be free from worry that youll instantly go blind""; however, if I want something, Ill ask for it...just like any other retailer.   Like I said...I got what I needed, a solid eye exam and prescription.  However, I purposely did not buy glasses there due to the doctors cheesy personality and the ""hard-sell"" environment.  Again, there are obviously (based on the other posters) people who are attracted to this type of personality...I am not one of them.   Hence, why I do most of my shopping online."
4,"One of my favorite restaurants in the valley. I usually go for the turkey wrap or one of their pizzas. On this day we went for happy hour, which is daily after 9pm and tried several tapas and a 4 peaks beer. Everything was really good."
4,"I was a little hesitant of Zipps when we pulled in - didnt look from the outside like it would offer an awesome time.  Walking in around 7 on a Friday night revealed a place that was almost full.  We chose to sit on the chilly patio, which did have a couple of heaters.  The heaters were a little high up and less effective, but it was also one of the coldest nights this year.  Service was fast and friendly, we never ran out of beer.  I got the BLT on Sourdough, and so did my friend, her husband got the Black and Blue Burger.  The fries were good, but not as crispy as I like.  The flavor was great and I ended up eating all of them.  The BLT was awesome! Tons of crispy bacon, and they cut it so that you were able to eat the sandwich without bacon attacking you.  The sourdough bread was thick cut and lightly toasted. The burger was a little less than we expected - 2 nice size patties, but the blue cheese could have been done a little better, and it was very messy.  The onion rings were nice sized and with great, fluffy breading on them. The on tap beer list was a little heavy on the cheap domestics for my taste, but they did have an Alaskan Amber that went great with the food. We were able to sit and talk for several hours, and the server made sure that we always had what we needed."
5,I had a great dinner there.  One of my best in a long time.  It was sucha treat.  Once in a while you have to take care of yourself and just enjoy what life has to offer.   Chef Juan was great to talk to.  Seems this guy has been there sinsr they broke ground.   If you truely like yourself take a walk around the grounds after dinner and smoke a cigar at the big Fire Pit or over by the dock. Life is good.
4,"Surprisingly authentic Sichuan cuisine in Phoenix. The staff were very friendly and accommodated our infant without any problem. The mapo doufu had great spice to it. The garlic eggplant (yuxiang qiezi) had excellent flavor and we also highly recommend the twice cooked pork (hui guo rou) and fried green beans (ganbian sijidou). The prices are certainly reasonable for the size and quality of the food. The open kitchen is also a nice touch as it gives kids something fun to stare at (flames shoot up from the dishes being cooked every few minutes). Admittedly, we only went because out POS airline put us up at the residence inn across the street after we missed a connecting flight, however, if we go back to Phoenix or if we lived in Phoenix, wed definitely go to Szechwan Palace again."
3,"When we lived in AZ, my biggest regret was not coming here. Ive always wanted to try it. Doing our road tripping this week, I was able to.  Parking was easy for a weekday...we went in - through the wrong door. Oops. The server who was stocking things seemed surprised, but rolled with it. She said we could sit anywhere we wanted (we were a party of three). We chose a table for 6 so we could spread out a little and not be so squished. She immediately snapped, ""Not that - its for 6 people."" I almost said, ""Then dont tell us we can sit wherever we want..."" I refrained. That surly girl nearly spoiled it, but luckily our server saved the day. I saw the hot dog...you know, the 22 inch insane monster on the menu. I split it with my friend. We didnt even finish it. It was delicious, if a bit salty. I knew it was a salt overload because in under an hour my fingers were swollen. :( Oh salt, why must I love you yet be so affected by you? We didnt finish it, but definitely enjoyed it. If I get this again when in town, Ill get it plain and still split it with a friend."
4,"Bianco is a great place to go for a reasonably priced dinner with good ambiance and solid rendition of Mexican food.   Yup, there are holes-in-the-wall tacquerias with tastier food.  But Bianco is spot-on in terms of  overall concept with good service and modern furnishing. Puts this on a repeat list."
1,"Love the idea - vegan Mexican. Have tried to eat there twice. Both times checked their FB page for hours, both times they were closed. Called their phone number, no one answered. No sign, no explanation on FB. Pathetic."
5,"Introduced to Dlish today by a friend. Id already had breakfast (although the menu looks great, lots of delicious sounding, healthy options) but he suggested a Chai coffee. I dont usually like Chai Tea, but I thought Id give the Chai coffee a chance based on his recommendation. When I ordered, the server suggested a ""Sexy Dirty Chai"", which as lurid as it sounds means adding vanilla. The Sexy Dirty Chai Coffee over ice is hands down now my favorite coffee drink. The place is tiny, has a really cool, funky interior and also has a drive thru- a true local gem. The service is friendly and energetic and I plan to start my day here again soon :)"
2,"We just stopped here as Slices no longer exits at TMP :( For JUST cold meat sandwiches...they are over priced. Short variety and more than $3 for some salame, cheese in average white bread.....no thank you."
3,"I really wasnt impressed. Came here with some friends to grab some takeout, and nothing really made me smile. The al pastor was meh, at best. The carne asada wasnt particularly noteworthy, and though the vampiro was tasty, there wasnt anything hugely redeeming about it. Nothing to write home about. Sucks, because my friends in Arizona swear by this place. Im giving it three stars more out of courtesy to them, but my own personal experience here wasnt anything over two. The people who worked here were very friendly...  Ive heard that the ceviche is the bomb diggity... I wish I could come back here and give it a better review, because Im sure that next time would be better, but as it stands right now, Im just not a huge fan. Sorry guys!"
3,"Everything was nice. The ice cream was delicious, no overwhelming alcohol taste & an interesting variety of flavors. Service was fine, place was clean. Ill go back, but only because I have a killer sweet tooth and theyre in the neighborhood."
4,"Food? Awesome. Service? Sufficient. Layout? Not the best. We stopped into Chompies this past Friday morning on our way out of town for the long weekend. My husband and I have this obsession with breakfast bagels - in particular, breakfast bagels from one amazing joint that makes the absolute best breakfast bagel EVER in our colleges hometown. We are always searching for a place as good as Bodos...well, even 3/4 as good as Bodos would do...and we never find it. Bodos is about the most efficient bagel store on Earth (literally the line of 40-50 people is serviced in 10 minutes) and cheap, too! So, we decided to give Chompies a whirl. I dont love the location - like everything else in Arizona, it is tucked into a strip mall. However, there was enough parking and we found it just fine. When you walk in, youre a bit confused as to where to go. Then you realize if you want to eat a full service sit down meal, head to the left - we didnt want to do this, but the food that I was eyeing from afar looked good. To the right is their bakery, which has some pretty appetizing cakes, cookies and desserts. Then there is this counter where you deduce that you order ""to go"" meals. We were overwhelmed by the menu but managed to pull ourselves together in time to order. We both had that initial panic attack of ""oh crap, I have never been here and the menu is longer than a 5 year olds Christmas list and I dont even know where to start because suddenly I feel like I cant even read English."" Deep breath. Its not actually that overwhelming, just a tad unorganized. After ordering, we were instructed to walk all the way across the bakery to a random counter to pay. It was so random the way they had it set up, but we did as we were told and then we waited. My husbands sandwich took a while to make....again, I dont know how Bodos does it, but Chompies is probably 4 times slower. Or is it more appropriate to say that Bodos is 4 times as fast? Whatever. Either way, Bodos has the breakfast bagel process down perfectly. Waiting was fine, though...we werent in a rush. When my husbands warm sandwich was finally ready, we got our stuff and then headed outside (there is nowhere to eat inside if you dont want to have a full service meal, which is one complaint I would make about this place). Who wants to eat their bagel outside when its pushing 110 degrees? Not me. Even if I am under a strip mall canopy that provides some shade. Anyway, his sandwich was actually really tasty - warm and fresh and really yummy. My bagel was not toasted, which I had requested, which was slightly annoying. However, the bagel itself was very good. We will definitely be back for the food, and I totally recommend this place for grabbing some freshly baked bagels or desserts or whatever. They do have a deli counter as well (meats, cheese, etc). Our breakfast was less than $8 without drinks - fair enough. I just wish that the layout were a little better and that it was more efficient. I also wish I could have eaten inside. Next time we will likely just do the full service thing. In the end, it seems that nothing will ever compare to our beloved Bodos in Charlottesville, Virginia."
5,"Simply the best Ethiopian Ive ever had.  Grew up in VA with DC as my stompin grounds (home of a large Ethiopian population) and even had a good amount of Ethiopian home-cooked meals by friends and none was as good as this place.   I go to AZ once a year for work and each time I am sure to stop in.  I usually get the veggie or meat-lovers meals since they tend to be such a good bargain, but have also ordered separate items as well.   The vibe is casual and the service is excellent.  The staff have always been very friendly --- another reason I keep going back."
3,"I always feel a sense of guilt having to write a less than stellar review after meeting the owner of a restaurant.  Lucia was Beautiful and sweet, and a pleasure to meet, my lunch, however, was not fit to eat.  I ordered the THE HUMM-DINGER VEGAN WRAP: Roasted artichoke, zucchini, red bell pepper, onion, fresh spinach and hummus with a balsamic reduction drizzle, with a side of fruit and the sun dried tomato wrap.  Notice it says ""Roasted"", the cashier told me the Veggies were ""Grilled"". Unfortunately, to my dismay, they were neither.  Everything inside was heated up, by either stove or microwave, Id guess the latter, and the ""Sun Dried Tomato Wrap"" was thin, doughy and utterly flavorless, not to mention a shocking pink color, which Im sure was due to being naturally colored with beet juice, but did not help make things anymore appetizing. The fruit was a soggy pile of your typical pre-cut cantaloupe, honey dew mix.  It was not what I was expecting AT ALL, when I think of a grilled veggie wrap, I imagine tasting all those veggies bursting with flavor after caramelizing on the grill, they had no flavor though. I also did not expect the temperature to be Hot, chilled would have been better in my opinion if the veggies had actually bee grilled that is.  This lunch to me was less than average and as I sat there will my full plate in front of me I was asked how my meal was, I clearly stated my concerns as I have here and was simply told that it was a ""Best Seller"".  Lucia did send over a piece of chocolate cake, which was appreciated, but unfortunately missed the mark since Im Vegan and the desserts arent.  Honestly, in my opinion, aside from the market, most of the menu items are anything but healthy.  The 3 stars is for the market, my food would have been 1. And that folks is why I am the Lunch Snob!"
4,"Ive been a Chars patron since before we were legal to be in there (many years ago, previous owners). It has always been a lively place with a diverse crowd of aging black hep-cats, college students, bikers, tweakers, college students, heavy middle aged white women who love black men, the ocassional tranny and Hispanic couples on dates with a sprinkling of occasional stippers/hookers. In other words - everything you would want to make a blues bar entertaining and just seedy enough to be interesting.  They are one of the only places in Central Phoenix with live music almost every night of the week and the cover, if any, is typically only a couple of bucks. The place is small and dark and crowded, like a blues bar in an old converted house should be. Talent varies by night but anytime you go its passable. Personal favorites are lady J and Bam Bam and any combination thereof, which is what you usually get any way. Wander in on a random Monday night and 11:30 and you will find music, cruising, and drinks waiting. There is a small enclosed patio up front for smoking, about 16 spaces in their lot and street parking available on the residential street, but watch the signs and dont block driveways. You can also cross 7th Ave, but be careful dodging cars. The neighborhood looks scarier than it is so dont be alarmed by a transient or two wandering down the street but they dont bite unless you pay extra. Close to lite rail as well in case sneaker pimps want to try to cross over from Central, but hopefully they wont."
3,"Bacon madness! Huge french toast! Cute little piggies decorating the orange walls! Oink is a friendly, peppy place to go for breakfast. The food is pretty good, the place is happy, all-in-all I would say this is the perfect place to wake up in the morning! The only irksome quality was our server, who seemed very nervous, checked on us at weird times, and said ""youre welcome"" too often (I didnt know that was possible, but it was).  I enjoyed the jalapeno (!) bacon and the oink french toast. The cinnamon rolls were also tasty, but my group was disappointed by the eggs benedict. I would say the food could be better, but its just awesome to have a local breakfast place somewhere in my neighborhood now!"
2,"US Airways used to be right up there w/Continental.. now theyre down there I didnt even mind the fact that they started charging for their food..  But now theyre going overboard..  I didnt want to bring a heavy jacket w/me to Cabo, so I wore a light jacket and I figured the standard blanket they give you during the flight would suffice.  I noticed there werent any blankets on board and when I asked a flight attendant for one he said "".......yea.. for $7"" I almost started laughing cause I thought he was trying to crack a joke.   He wasnt.   Introducing US Airways ""nap pack"" comes w/crappy blanket, ear plugs, inflatable neck rest , for only $7!  Use the money you were previously going to use to purchase your online crappy meal for your standard necessities!   So I decline.. and they must crank the A/C up ridiculously to tempt you to purchase their stupid nappy pack.. cause the tip of my nose was cold and I just couldnt sleep at all during my flight w hile I was trying cover every surface of my body w/my stretched out light jacket. And you also suck cause you run out of your purchased meals...who doesnt pack enough for the flight?  You suck at even saving money for yourselves.."
4,"I am a shoe addict.  I also appreciate a good bargain.  Whenever I am bored and have a little time on my hands, I like to take a walk through DSW.  I think it is kind of like playing ""dress up"".  You can try on anything and everything.  Such fun!  This location is one of the better ones I have visited.  It is well-organized, and the stock turns over regularly.  It is one of those hit or miss places - I will either leave with nothing or with an obnoxious amount of new footwear.  You just never know.  It has a fairly large clearance section as well - if you have the patience to look, bargains can often be found.  Definitely sign up for their rewards program - you will receive coupons regularly - yay!  Happy hunting!"
5,I had Thai coffee and thai fresh rolls. It was good. The vegetables were fresh and delicious. Plans to visit again.
4,"Inexpensive, tasty, fast. The gentle peanut dressing on the pre-meal salad gets you started on a simple, no-frills meal with exactly one option from all of the classic dishes you expect at a Thai restaurant in America: massaman, red, green, yellow, or panang curry; pad thai or chowmein; meat or vegetable rice plates. Theres nothing extravagant in spices or food choices, but you can order the spiciness level to you liking."
3,"Wanted some mexican that wasnt taco bell. The hotel recommend this place. The restaurant smelled like the inside of a tomato sauce can. I was turned off almost immediately. I decided to sit on the patio and try it out anyway. I ordered the Chipotle BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad with a light cilantro lime dressing. It was okay. The chips and salsa were okay too, nothing to brag about. The salsa tasted like it came from a can. Im happy I ordered a salad. The redeeming factors were the Arizona Sunset Margarita and the good service. I think once restaurants turn into chains, they seem to lose their original character."
5,"4.5 stars! Ive eaten at Liberty Market a few times already, but this morning marked my first breakfast- and what a fantastic meal it was!- of pancakes (3 in a stack; $6.5) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=Xg8U6Fz2E8hu0xQ3Hf7CZg#Xg8U6Fz2E8hu0xQ3Hf7CZg w/ added topping of ""market-made granola"" ($1), a side of Grilled Flattened Meatballs ($3.5) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=MMwKpMltbKCWNNlraI-tGw#MMwKpMltbKCWNNlraI-tGw, and a double-shot of espresso ($2) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=M1WrCuX3oouHHrynL8KJQg#M1WrCuX3oouHHrynL8KJQg.  Service was in fine form-- I couldnt have the market-made maple syrup blend, nor any of the house-whipped cream, blueberry compote, raspberry and apricot jams, or any of the flavored syrups used at the coffee counter (my server patiently checked for those items we were unsure about), and when I asked for chocolate chips, I was, instead, offered a chocolate syrup made from scratch composed of chocolate, sugar, and coco oil... good stuff!  This syrup would be excellent on ice cream sundaes, too.  (FYI, I didnt really need anything extra to add to the pancakes and meatballs... the two paired well!) Ive mentioned this once before, but I think its such a great thing to yelp about again-- buy an espresso (or any of their specialty coffees), and you can have unlimited cups of regular coffee during your meal!  Not like I needed more caffeine after the double-shot, but I did have some of the house-blend coffee.  After 1.5 pancakes, the meatballs (watch out, theyre very greasy!), and caffeine, Ill be good to go for a few hours, despite only having four hours of sleep!  (Im hoping, anyway!) p.s.  Despite tipping more than 20% at the cashier upon ordering, I thought Bruce, the server who took care of me at my table, deserved a couple more bananas for not displaying annoyance at my staying here so long.  One more reason why I love Liberty Market so much!   Addendum:  After getting directions from Bruce as to the quickest way to 101 N, he asked me if I wanted a cup of coffee to go, gratis!  Have I told you how much I love Liberty Market?? Helpful hint:  Free wifi can be accessed by entering the code printed at the bottom of your receipt."
1,We ordered.  I had to return my chicken tenders.  Undr cooked and rubbery.  My wife ordered a hamburger and is now home throwing it up.  what a horrible experience.  We have been huge fans and now this?  I called and spoke with someone who barely has a grasp on our language and they said they would get right back to me.  Still waiting My wife is in bed looking so sick.  We will never return!!
4,My dog is very difficult and they do a very good job handling her.  It did take a few times before she got comfortable with them.  I am glad I found The Doggie Door.
4,Met my friend Jackie to grab a cup of coffee and ended up staying for hours!  It is a great place to relax with comfy seats and a great vibe.  We plan to go there one night after a movie to sit and relax while listening to the live music.  Very cool.  They have delicious sandwiches and their baked goods looked amazing!   The baristas are so nice and helpful and very friendly.  The place is modern and inviting. They offer so many organic healthy choices.  It is located in Norterra close to the Harkins Theater. Glad she suggested this place ~ we will definitely be back.
5,"My home airport and one of the nicest terminals in the USA! Great food, cool things to see and do, you just cant get bored here!"
4,"Theres different kinds of Mexican places around.   Type A:  Pseudo-Mexican fast food (Taco Bell, El Pollo Loco, Del Taco, etc.) Type B: REAL Mexican fast food (whateveri-bertos, Baja Fresh, Rubios etc.) Type C: Various traditional taquerias (Los Favoritos, Rivas Mexican Food, etc.) Type D: ""Mexican Dennys"" or chain-type sit down Mexican Restaurants--traditional-style or not (Chevys, El Torito, Macayos, etc.)  Type E: REAL formal or semi-formal Mexican restaurants (I dont know any in the Valley yet, but in the Bay Area there is the now closed La Michoacana in San Mateo, CA, etc.) Valle Luna is a Type D, and a pretty good one as well.  Delicious traditional-style Mexican food.  The interior looks like what you usually see in a Chevys or Macayos.  Its visually pleasing, and service is friendly and helpful.  They have all the beers, margaritas, and tequila that you usually find at places like this (you know what I mean).  Its the kind of Mexican place you take someone for their birthday--exactly. Do you check in to places on Yelp using your iPhone?   Come to Valle Luna!  Show them the check-in on your phone and you get $5 off of a meal costing $20 or more.  Perfect for lunch with your co-worker. Valle Luna means good Mexifood.  If youre in the mood for a Type D, bypass the ""Fresh Mex"" and come here."
4,"I have gone here several times and have tried the pizza, subs and the calzones.  I have not had anything there that I did not like and the only reason I dont give this five stars is because everytime I am in there it seems a large group with lots of young kids has just sat down (or come to run around me while I try to eat) at the same time as my date and I.  I admit, I wish restaurants had sections for families so that those who do not like watching kids run around or spitting food out of their mouths on to the table could eat in peace, but that is just me and that is why I have dogs and not children. Anyway, this place has awesome food, good service and if you can handle large groups of families then I highly recommend you take the drive out here to give it a try."
1,"Nice looking place with average food and horrible service.  Everything took forever and no one came by to see how we were doing.  We literally watched our server going around setting tables and taking napkins off of empty tables rather than making himself available to us.  He wandered around from table to table in a completely unoccupied area of the restaurant the majority of the time we were there.  The food was luke-warm and nothing special.  I was only here once so I hate to be so down on the place, but based on the other reviews my experience sounds pretty typical.  Dont waste your money."
4,"Copper Star is a great example of adaptive use in the heart of the Melrose curve. Who would have thought that a building initially designed to provide fuel to cars would so work so well serving fuel to humans? Their coffee is locally roasted and, while not my favorite, is well above average in Phoenix. Their drive-thru is a great feature for those mornings when Im running late. For the coffee adverse, Copper Star serves chai, tea, smoothies, Italian sodas, and some unique drinks including a black cherry limeade. Foodwise, there is a wide selection of baked goods,including some of the best bagels. They also have decent lunch offerings, such as sandwiches and a tasty hummus platter. But where they shine is their home baked cupcakes. (Ive seen Mayor Gordon here on several occasions getting his cupcake fix!)  Despite being in a converted gas station/garage, the atmosphere is quite a bit more cozy than most of the other coffee shops in central Phoenix. While the sandblasted block walls and exposed ceiling let that buildings industrial past peak through, this is offset by rotating art work and selection of comfortable (if a bit dingy) couches and easy chairs as well as small bistro tables and long work tables to choose from. The staff is friendly and helpful, and the owner, Bill, is a great neighborhood resource. He can tell you anything and everything going on along 7th Ave. All in all a good place to grab a coffee and cupcake,  meet a friend or get some old fashioned reading done. I cant recommend it for serious work requiring internet access, however, as the wifi access remains intermittent at best."
5,"What can I say ?  This is awesome.  I am a donut fan and would give Dunkin 4 stars, just like this place.  Great variety, great coffee, fresh donuts.  The extra 1 star comes for the fluffiness of their dough.  Its very fluffy and its done just right.   Dunkin is good but its donuts will taste a little hard and ""old"" when they have been sitting for a while.  For some reason, the Bosa donuts dun get too hard, even after U buy and drive for like 1/2 hour home.  I know its not located in the best part of town, but they are open 24 hrs and there is a drive thru.  They accept credit cards and discover :)"
5,One word: PISTACHIO... in all its glory... no need to say more.
4,"The rumors are true, this place was an awesome continental breakfast. Its not the usual Costco Danish +  some small cereal boxes.  They had 4 hot buffet trays with eggs, sausages, potatoes, several coffee flavors and a waffle maker with all the condiments and more! The service was quite good and the rooms were clean and not cheap looking.  My family booked it the night before and we got a surprisingly fair price.   Its right next to the Glendale Stadium stores, so be wary when the Cardinals are playing at home.  The location is ideal for Glendale and downtown trips.   Stop by for an superb breakfast on a budget to start a fun day in Phoenix."
5,"We happened upon this place on Sunday. We had our 2 1/2 year old with us and she was yelling about being hungry. We quickly ducked into Zinburger. All three of us had burgers. The kids burger was huge and it came with fries. We also ordered the sweet potato fries. The people around us had milkshakes and they looked delicious. I also noticed fried zucchini and figure next time Ill order those instead of fries.  We were in a rush and had something at 6 pm. We told the waiter we were in a hurry. He was great, friendly and accommodating. We were seated next to the hostess stand and my daughter kept trying to engage the folks standing there. Everyone was so nice.  My constructive feedback would be that I ordered my burger medium well and I received it medium rare. It still tasted yummy and I ate it. Had it been served that way to my hubby - he would not have been able to stomach the red juice flowing from the burger."
3,A very  good sandwhich shop!  My boy and I stopped in here after a movie at the AMC.  They have a neat concept with the bags on the wall where you mark your items. My only wish is that they had cold sandwhiches as well as the toasted variety.  I am not always (rarely in fact) in the mood for a toasted sandwhich. The italian sandwhich I got though was delicious. NOM NOM NOM
4,Another lovely mom and pop with fabulous authentic thai.  The prices are very reasonable and Ive never had a problem with the service.
2,I was not happy with the service department.  Service writer had a poor attitude towards helping me.  Repair work was done well and on budget but it is sad how a greeter can sour you on the whole place.
5,Dr. Lee does excellent work and he and the staff are very friendly and professional.  The best dental care I have ever received and I have lived all over the country and grew up at the dentist with my bad teeth.  They work very well with children also.
4,"Very casual.    Great white alfredo pizza.  We get it with mushrooms, onions and ricotta.  So yum!  Very pleasant staff.  Delivery - quick!  Salads are just okay.  Standard - w/ iceburge lettuce  Its really for the pizza that we go."
4,"I know my 2 girlfriends that absolutely LOVE this place will balk at my 4 stars instead of 5. But honestly, I think this place is slightly overrated. Dont get me wrong, I like this place, and I oblige them every time they want to go, but I think 4 stars is just right for the rating.  We went there this weekend, and the typical scenario went down. Parking was cramped (lucked out to get a ""valet"" spot which I parked into myself as it was right out front by the entrance - no Im not waiting for you Mr. Valet Dude to get into my car and pull it forward into the spot right in front of my face, thank you very much), and there was a short wait (maybe 10-15 minutes). We sat outside, which wasnt ideal since it was cold and drizzly, but we had patio heaters on both sides of our table so it was OK.  Sadly we didnt make their $5 wine special, which ends at 5pm, so we were paying full price for the glasses of wine - ranging from $8 to about $12-13. I dont know about you, but I really am not a fan of paying $10 for a glass of wine when I can pay that for an entire bottle. But alas, I had 2 different wines through the course of the night, both on recommendation from the servers, and both decent.  We ordered the infamous bruschetta, with the 4 choices being: smoked salmon (YUM!), warm artichoke (tasty), roasted red pepper (still good), and white bean with tomato (OK, but nothing to write home about).  For dinner, I had the half & half combo (where you get to choose 2 different items), and I chose the mixed green salad (REALLY delicious, with an awesome combination of greens, pears, grapes, gorgonzola cheese, pecans, & poppyseed dressing) and half of a turkey/pesto pannini. The pannini was QUITE boring. Didnt have much flavor at all. I think it was lacking on the pesto.  And honestly, this is what I come to expect at Postino. Some things are just unbelievable and you want to lick your plate clean, and other things are simply boring and tasteless (like the white bean/tomato bruschetta and the turkey/pesto pannini).  And hence my rating of 4 stars rather than 5. If the parking was easier, the wines were always $5 a glass, and the food was consistent, I would give it 5 stars. Fair enough?  :)"
3,"I have been to this location several times because again, right around the corner from my salon. I so want to be able to give it a higher rating but every time I go the service is really not that great. Last week I went for wing and Wii night, 30 cent wings cant be beat. I have had better wings, but hey this is a Mexican joint and our bill was not even $4! But our waitress looked like she could care less about being there, never asked if we wanted a refill on our chips and salsa and never stopped by the table to see if we like our food. Now being in the service industry and having spent many years as a server I get that you think since the bill is so low your tip is going to suck. That simply doesnt have to be the case, we left our server a $6 tip and we werent even there long. You get 4 tables like that an hour you are set, so perk up and smile, you never know how far that can go.  I went there last night for Taco Tuesdays, $1 to $2 tacos cant be beat and the tacos are so tasty I always order 3, the mahi, crunchy fish and steak. The mahi was flaky and sweet, the crunchy taco had a sweet taste to it with the sauce and red onion. Not greasy at all. The steak was tender and flavorful. Again though our service was sub par. We had already finished our chips and salsa before we even got our water, took way to long, same with the food and it wasnt even that busy. We were sitting inside and there were only 20 people in the bar area and there was only one other table eating. Now our server wrote our order on her had, she seemed tired and frazzled, and we had to bring our bill to her at the end to check out, we waited a while before doing that. It seemed like she might have been the only server in the place, but she did have the help of a gentleman by the name of Frenchy. I liked Frenchy, big dude but with dry wit and he seemed like the jack of all trades for the place. Doorman, food runner, busser, you name it he was doing it.  I will continue to come to Loco because the tacos are so damn good but I just hope they figure out the staff issues. I gave it 4 times and every time my complaint is the same, the service needs to step it up."
5,Best breakfast in west Chandler!  I love their crepe eggs and calorie/nutritional info printed on the menu.
2,"Phoenix is lacking in good Indian restaurants, and that is compounded if youre in the mood for South Indian food. Cafe Krishna is a perfect example. I would come here again on occasion only because I often crave South Indian and there are no superior alternatives.  I ordered the sambar-vada. The vada was not as hearty or flavorful as I would ordinarily expect. It was also served somewhat lukewarm. The chutneys were mediocre. The vada was a bit too soft for my liking. Dosa is harder to screw up, so I enjoyed that a bit more, but still nothing out of this world.  The service was poor, unprofessional and a bit chaotic. The environment and atmosphere were good. I was not impressed by the cleanliness of the bathrooms, which for me is always a bad sign for what must be the cleanliness level of the kitchen."
5,"This is the second time Ive eaten here and it was as good if not better than the first.  The first time I had the meat lasagna and the second time I had the cheesesteak. Lemme tell you this is one of the best Italian places Ive been to in Phx. Its very Back East feel to it and I love all of the authentic Italian foods they have there, especially the meat, cheese and pasta counters. Check em out you wont be disappointed!"
4,"M-Troniks repaired a 1970s Fender Bassman 10 for me.  They re-coned the speaker, letting the stock speakers remain.  They also replaced the tubes and adjusted them.  New longer cord as well.  They fixed this old thing up!   Crazy guitars for sale and other odds and ends."
5,I almost wish I hadnt discovered this place because its so good! Tons of flavors and every kind of topping you could want (even cake frosting)  So much better than MoJo and to top it off the staff couldnt have been nicer.
4,"i cannot give this place 5 stars because i went there today at 3:30 and IT WAS CLOSED.  what business closes at 3?  REALLY?  oh phoenix, youre killing me. BUT the food (creative, delicious sandwiches and desserts), speedy service, and reasonable prices really do deserve 5 stars.  The chicken/asparagus/havarti sandwich almost killed my taste buds with its deliciousness.  i went for carry-out at a peak time (about 12:30) and TOTAL, from joining the 6-person line to walking out the door, I probably spent about 15 minutes there.  very fast service=very happy jenny. i didnt get dessert, but i will be back on a day when im feeling either very fit or very depressed.  maybe tomorrow, due to my 3 PM CLOSE TIME funk.  crimeny.  :)"
4,"Its been awhile since this place was reviewed... and probably just as long since my last visit.  In the last few months (or possibly more), this restaurant changed names (it was previously The Counter) and cleared out the retail boutique area to make room for more seating. Future yelper Nancie S suggested we meet for lunch here today, and I was impressed with the changes.  By no means is Chloes Corner a high end restaurant... its more like a retro diner with a modern feel.  Its the kind of place you order at the counter and pay for it, and then they bring your food to your table when its ready.  Its also great for those who want to pick up something quick on the go... We both ordered the chopped salad and a side of toasted cranberry walnut bread.  It was really tasty!  You can tell they use high quality ingredients... the salad is a unique combination of field greens, turkey, bleu cheese, walnuts, and grapes with poppyseed dressing.  I would for sure order it again although the tuna melt looked pretty amazing too!  There are several other classic items on the menu such as grilled cheese, tomato soup, milkshakes, etc... Even more impressive than the lunch was the fact that I found a parking spot right away at Kierland and I left without going into one single store.  Im so proud of myself for that... any fellow shop-a-holics know how hard that can be! Although I did like this place when it was ""The Counter,"" it looks to me like the change that Fox Restaurant Concepts made to this restaurant was a good one!"
5,"Stingray Sushi is where we go for sushi . Sleek ,beautiful interior and very ,very clean ! This dining house has large 13 or so foot doors that when open ,seamlessly link the patio potion with the interior dining area ,a very good design flow,indeed. The patio itself is very comfortable as it has great seating . The service has always been wonderful ,the sushi very fresh with beautiful presentation .We like to get the sushi boat , edamame ,and beef yakitori.The fire dragon rolls( though on the small side) are also yummy. Drinks are very good here ..the sinful orchid (yum)a very pretty drink .And their HH is really good as well ."
2,"Weve eaten at Arriba a few times now.  I really dont care for their food, and service is slow more often than not.  The first time we went we were there it took a good two hours!  And thats not because were slow eaters.  We did stop in for happy hour last week though, and although their margaritas arent the greatest, theyre decent enough!  They ofter a 12 oz. house margarita for .99 or a 24 oz. grande for 4.99.  Why people would pay five times as much for a marg twice the size, I dont know.  We each had three .99 margs, ate the chips, salsa and bean dip and our bill came to 5.94.  $6 and I left with a full stomach and a buzz.  Nice!"
3,"Sometimes I really wish I could live in Scottsdale. I met up with two girlfriends there and we had a great time! This visit was a solid 3-4. We went in to take advantage of their happy hour (if you dont the prices seem wayyyy to steep for me). Anyway, if you take advantage of their happy hour you must sit either in the outside patio or the lounge. Now the outdoor patio was beautiful! Prettiest outdoor seating I have seen ever. But not when it is 104 out. (and there are no misters). Why did we sit outside do you ask? Because the bar area (which is tiny) filled up super fast (duh. its yummy!) The indoor ambiance is beautiful. (a little dark) The most awesome lights ever are in there. The service was good and the location is nice (right next to the free parking too!) I tried the featured white wine, and whatever it was (sorry I forgot) was good! My friend tried the sangria, but I was not a fan. Weird flavor compared to most sangrias that I cant describe.  Now onto the food. People who raved about the flatbread pizzas...I have no idea what you are talking about.  I had the margharita and it was just not good. Soggy and flavorless. The hummus was very yummy. Needed more pita with it. Now onto the star of the show: the bruschetta. The vine ripe tomato is yummy. The apple caponata is just as yummier, and the prosciutto and fig was also excellent! Ohhhh so yummy! This is the place to get bruscetta and wine after a long day."
5,"Of course, they are no La Madeliene, but if you are looking for some good croissants, this is the place to be. I love, love, love their croissants. But which bakerys croissants do I not love? hmm... But I do love theirs. I have had the almond croissant, the almond and chocolate croissant and finally today when we went there, I had the chocolate croissant. It was just freaking amazing. Thats all I can say. (They run out of the chocolate almond croissants pretty quickly so go early if you want some) I have also had lunch here before, some Mediterranean sandwich stuff. The portion is very small compared to the price. Their macaroons look crazy and funky. Have not tried them yet but plan on doing so next time. I almost gave them 4 stars because their hours they are open are very weird. But its okay, I will compromise Essence Bakery.  They only use butter imported from Normandy in their Croissants. Wow."
4,"Yumm!  Thai tea, spicy Thai beef salad, number 23a and a 32, all of it was delicious! I recommend this place. Just dont go in a hurry because you will be there a while"
4,"RnR strikes me as a casual, urban place to meet up for drinks and a bite to eat. Its not what comes to mind when I think old town Scottsdale, but places like this popping up are helping to change my mind about the area. Unfortunately after I was finished I was reminded that its still old town when I walked by a pan flute band on Main St. The old town parking corral is directly behind RnR, you can get to it from the alley next to RnR or off of 2nd Street. The space has a refreshing, industrial feel. I was impressed by the thought put into the seating options. Inside mostly features traditional high top tables for four, but I noticed they had a table near the bar that could seat at least 12. The downstairs patio features another bar, and both table and lounge chair seating. The upstairs patio has the best date seating, lots of tables for two. There was a lot of staff working during my visit. The host was friendly, and my waiter was attentive. My water was never empty and I got my sandwich in under 10 minutes. If anything they were a little too eager to please. I was both impressed and bemused when my waiter refilled my water glass, apparently noticed my ice had mostly melted, then returned with a scoop of ice to add to my cup. I just got a grilled cheese (which includes tomato and bacon) on my visit, I had dinner plans later but I was interested in feeling this place out. I really enjoyed it. The bread is cut pretty thick, which made me a little nervous. But it had a wonderful texture, and after a few bites I decided it worked for me and didnt overpower the delicious sharp cheddar and bacon like I expected. I look forward to returning to try other meals, and to sample what the bar has to offer. I understand RnR will have both late night hours and breakfast service. This is a great place to visit any time of day, but Im excited about having a new, good place I can frequent after (or during) a night out."
5,"Dont usually give 5 stars, but this is good sushi. At first, I was a little skeptic of all the macadamia nuts on their sushi, but it is a great compliment. The rolls are original and all very good. The Climax(s) and the Elliot are my favorite."
4,"As the mom of  2 kids (a 3 year old and a 8 month old) it seems to be very difficult to find a nice place to eat that is very comfortable and casual- and somewhere that people dont give you evil looks and comments  for bringing kids (Carrabas). We have been here a few times for lunch and the food has always been good. Not great, but pretty good and inexpensive. I will say though that their french fries are some of the best Ive had! I would much rather come here than IHOP"
2,"Cheap. Cheap. Cheap. Everything here is disposable, from the furniture to the linens to silverware. (Silverware rusted after one cycle in the dishwasher!).  So if you like to redecorate often and have a minimal budget this place is for you.  As far as their food, Ive only had a cinnamon roll here and it was stale. Bummer. My biggest annoyance here are the people who seem to be beached out on all the couches/beds/chairs. Dont you have homes?"
3,"The cajun seasoning on my salad was terrible, but everything else was just fine. But food aside, Id come here again for the atmosphere. Its not my scene, but I enjoyed how friendly the waitress was. I was surprised that she didnt know what an old fashioned was (my barometer of how good a bar is), but the bartender did and gave me a drink that was well balanced, but needed way more alcohol. Old fashioneds are not orange and look and taste like juice! It was fun watching the girl buck around on the mechanical bull. I have a feeling that the operator liked jiggling her around for a reason though...All in all an enjoyable dinner with friends."
4,I go to GB for the balcony and the hefeweisen.  One a warm sunny day there arent many places I would rather relax.  Watching the people on Mill Ave as well as the planes flying into Phx can kill a few hours if you are bored.  The food is ok.  The hummus appetizer is usually a safe choice as is the pizza.
2,"Ill agree that this is a great meet up place in the city. Nice neighborhood, adequate parking in the structure behind, and a greta atmosphere with great service. The menu is interesting and Id come back to try more but heres what our first visit was like. As a Starter we had the Spinach Quesadilla made with Lavosh and it was great. I mean really great and enough as a meal for two. For that alone Id go back. My better half had the Falafel Pita and thought it was OK.  I had the Gyros Pita and got luncheon meat. Im talking precisely sliced, straight from the fridge but thrown on the grill to warm-up luncheon meat. If you go online to see the menu, its one of the items you can click for a nutrition chart. Heres what it reads for the ""meat"" Gyro Beef [Beef, Lamb, Water, Bread Crumbs (Bleached Wheat Flour, Water, Dextrose,Salt and Yeast may contain soy bean oil, Calcium Propionate), Soy Protein Concentrate, Less thean 2% Salt, Garlic and Onion Powder, Monosodium Glutamate, ]; So, the takeaway here is stay away from the Gyro.  But, Hey!  Gyro IS a pita. I expected a reasonable execution. Heck, make a Gyro meatloaf and slice it up at least.  Yes, Im bitter."
4,"I have stopped in here for lunch and drinks a few times now. The teriyaki beef/chicken and bulgolgi have great flavor (I prefer the spicy versions). Their bowl meals come with plenty of meat and rice, while the bento meals also come with macaroni and slaw. These are affordable dishes and excellent for a lunch of easy take-out dinner. In addition, the meals are big enough that two people could split one. The other item that I really like here is the boba. The milk tea and Thai iced tea both have a nice tea flavor and are not overly sweet like some places. Hence, its also a nice place to pass by for a drink."
3,"Arrived around 5pm one Wednesday evening. The place is not in a nice area of Phoenix, and it looked deserted, and I was going to leave, when I saw a Mercedes and Lexus pull up.  So I thought Id give it a chance. The prices were somewhat reasonable, I got the Lo-Los for $11 (2 waffles, and 3 pieces of fried chicken). The food was tasty for what it was, but I only give it 3 *s because its just so unhealthy.. kool-aid, waffles, syrup, and fried chicken! This is the kinda a place I may go once a year, but I just feel so guilty!  Not sure what the syrup was, but it certainly wasnt real maple syrup (Id imagine it is some sugar based creation), and the waffles were dry. The chicken wasnt very moist, it was also a bit on the dry side."
4,"If youre looking for a good meal with solid service youll find it here.  The menu has something for everyone, too.  If you like to go out for lunch or brunch, this is a great place to go.  Friendly, fast staff helps make the experience that much better."
4,"Lams Seafood Market is a rare Asian gem in the Westside.. sort of like me ;-) haha just kidding.  I love this place! Great prices, fresh seafood :-) They also have a wide assortment of Filipino products which is a MUST for my kitchen.  The parking lot is a lil shady and could use some covering for the potholes."
5,"I have no idea why I havent dined or noshed during happy hour at this place more often, Ive always had great service, great wine, and great food. There is no adequate excuse , but anyway, my third adventure here made me update my review to 5 stars because 5th and Wine has earned it. The wines by the glass range from $8 - $11 unless you come in before 6pm then they are only $5! Those prices alone should make you want to come here for drinks with friends. The servers have always been cool with offering samples if you cant make up your own mind between two wines despite the recommendation from the server and your friend saying ""just pick one!"". Due to this fact, Ive always had a glass that I have enjoyed, which is usually a Zinfandel.  I have now had the pleasure of experiencing all of their different types of bruschetta. My top two favorites are the Prosciutto, Mascarpone, Figs, and Tomato Jam which has a great combination of salty and sweet, and the Apples, Brie, and Fig Jam one which is on the sweeter side, but not overwhelming because the bread and the tart granny smith apple slices help balance out the flavor. The Chopped Salad is very light and refreshing option to accompany the brushcetta appetizer. 5th and Wine is also a restaurant so other food options are available, I have sampled the Chicken and Pesto Pasta which has a delicious cream sauce and their Mac & Cheese which is super rich with the two types of melted cheese, but both items are delicious. The atmosphere is great whether you are sitting inside or outside. The lighting is soft, giving more of an intimate feel, yet this place still remains simple and casual, which I love. The outside patio is great, it is a courtyard that offers peeks into store windows while remaining private from the traffic of Old Town. The times I have been here it has never been super crowded and I am able to just walk in and be seated right away. 5th and Wine still feels like a hidden gem and you must try it out!"
4,"Fun trivia! Food is mediocre. Crowd was cool and there is plenty to do there (video games, darts etc..) When Im back in Tempe visiting friends I know well be back. Bonus for having the misters and a great seating area outside. We met some very nice locals who were up for a good chat."
2,"If Ive come to your Starbucks over 30x within 5 months and you still dont bother learning how to pronounce my name correctly then I dont know what to say. I always order the same drink: quad espresso with 3 pumps of white mocha and 80% of the time they dont get my order right! The baristas always ask if I want water or milk with it.. Seriously? I ordered a damn espresso for a reason. If I wanted water or milk then I wouldve ordered something else and NOT an espresso! And my drink is one of the simplest drinks to make too!! Just brew 4 shots, mix in white mocha syrup and add ice.. But they always somehow mess up by asking me stupid questions. If it werent  for this sb being the closest to school, I would definitely frequent the Thunderbird location!"
1,"AWFUL.  Not sure it classifies as food.  Burrito consists of a flour tortilla and meat.  No salsa, beans, cheese, sour cream, guacamole.  Nada.  Plus they wont let you add anything to it.  Everything is as is.  The cheese enchalada had cheese but it was not gooey and melted.  The food was barely luke warm.   Service is also mediocre.  The salsa was gross.  It was super water down.  The best part of the meal was my Pepsi."
5,"Over the top cheesesteaks. Best in Phoenix, perhaps the world. Amazing food and friendly service. Best ever."
4,"NO!  The only good dim sum in town, however, yesterday we went and there was a sign on the door that the landlord had shut them down and changed the locks for failure to pay rent."
5,I love this second location in the Royal coffee series as much as the one at the market! Since its summer - I thought I should mention that the iced coffee is so smooth and amazing that you dont even have to add anything to it!! Dont believe me?  Ask for a sample next time you are here and I guarantee you will be astounded! A quiet and chill atmosphere if you want to work/study/read as well as a great place for delicious grab n go coffee in the Biltmore area!
3,"Third time back.  This is my 9 year old daughters favorite restaurant for special celebrations.  Maybe because the portions are sized for her.   Just kidding.  Sort of. Always good food.  Sometimes terrific.  But never consistently, hit the ball out of the park good.   The bill creeps up on you.  We cant ever seem to walk out the door with less than $80-120 bill for 2-3.   Last night, had the filet.  At maybe 5 ournces, bigger and more substantial than the last time, when I think I paid $32 for 2 ounces.  Seriously. Last time the steak was perfect.  This time, they overcooked it, but I didnt have the heart to send it back.  So my wife ate it and enjoyed it, and I got her salmon. Salmon was just okay.  BUT, the bed of rissoto, one of my favorite dishes, was delightfully rich and creamy. Overall, its not a terrible value.  And its a cute little french restaurant.  COMPLETELY and totally not appropriate for small children, so dont even try.  Great date place. Whatever you do, you MUST try two things:   1) Onion Tart - its just a slice and a side salad as an appetizer, but OH what a slice. 2) Berry Tart - the deserts are what makes this place go.  Save room.   Remember this: IF YOU GO TO A RESTAURANT WITH TART IN ITS NAME, AND DONT ORDER A TART... well, what can I say.  Just dont do it. Will be back, as I always have, and will promise to only feel slightly mugged next time I pay the bill."
4,"Reviews of this place are all over the board, but I always eat there when I do my yearly Scottsdale gallery crawl. The food and ambience, a series of indoor and outdoor patio rooms, are quaint and very satisfying, with good size portions, and a very friendly staff. At least to me they are. I was last there in late November and had the days special, enchiladas in a poblano sauce which was quite good. The salsa is spiced just right."
4,"Treated my sister-in-law to a message here on Super Bowl Sunday.  They have great hours & were very accommodating even though we only made our appts about 24 hours in advance.  When we booked, the receptionist (who was really helpful and nice) mentioned the groupon promotion ($40 for $100 worth of services) as well as SpaFinder gift cards.  We thought we could combine them, and we arrived at our appt to find that they werent supposed to combine discounts.  But the receptionist made an exception and we were really appreciative! The massage was nice, could have used a little more pressure.  Cute atmosphere and friendly/helpful staff.  I would come back, especially with SpaFinder/discounts."
4,"I had always heard great things about Pita Jungle, but it wasnt until a recent visit there that I became a believer. Really great food for a reasonable place!"
3,"Very good food but a little overpriced for the amount of food you get so the price is the only reason I am giving it a 3 star instead of a 4 star.  Cost about $11.50 for a small sandwich side salad and an ice tea.  All the food seems to be of the organic nature so definitely taste is higher quality. I have been there 3 times and each time left still hungry; however, did feel that I had a healthier lunch than other options in the area. If you are in the mood for a high quality / healthy light lunch and okay with paying $10-12 per person definitely give Essence Bakery a shot."
4,Love the medium wings and green salad with thousand island dressing!  The bartender CJ is da bomb!
4,"My husband and I frequent this restaurant quite a bit. We use to be huge fans of the Ahi Tuna burger with sweet potato fries (the fries rock). Unfortunately, they removed the Ahi Tuna burger from the menu which was very disappointing. I do like the Tiki fish sandwich though. I do which that they would included a fish sandwich on their lunch menu on the weekend. Although, when I have gone for lunch on the weekend and have asked if they can make a fish sandwich they have always accommodated me.  I would give this place 5 star, but I think their one weakness is their brunch menu. I took a friend there for lunch because we loved their dinner and lunch menu so much, but it was very disappointing. We ordered Bloody Marys and had to send them back because the horseradish was overwhelming. In fact, all you could taste was horseradish, no tomato juice or anything. All three of us sent them back and they could remake them because they were part of a batch that they pre-mixed - UGH! Plus, I was the only one that liked my breakfast. My husband and friend were not impressed.  Also, I adore their Hawaiian fish ceviche - yum!!"
1,"ok so heres what they teach:  if you are a good person it is right and good for you to take from others and give it to yourself, because you deserve it and everyone else is a bad person.  Stealing is okay, lying is okay, as long as it is done by you, but for the others, they have no place in society, so pillage and destroy them, it is your right and you will be rewarded for that.  Wow."
5,Walking in was like seeing a rainbow for the first time. UH-mazing! Every type of candy ever created and more candies that youve never even heard of. Best part about it was that it was super affordable. It was like a mini-costco of just candy.  I ended up going twice on Saturday. Love it!
3,"After a business trip, I reeeeeally needed a massage. Facility was alright. I personally think it needs an upgrade.  Right off the bat, the area with the lockers (and really where you would get nakey!) is very public...thats the first area that everyone walks through. The outside lounge area was also VERY tiny.  I went out there and walked right back in because it was full with little privacy.  By that I mean I walked out there and BAM!  A large naked woman scared me back inside.  Really?  G. D. people!  Im trying to relax.  Naked out of shape people stress me out!  Just ONCE, I want to see a naked hot person walking around.  And if a woman goes nakey, do some basic maintenance first although that much hair does prevent seeing everything, so it may be a blessing...ugh, you know what?  Just stay clothed.  Please? But my masseuse totally made up for that.  60 minutes of amazing...I forgot all about business and naked people who should be naked in private! 3 stars because Joelle worked magic! She was great and super friendly.  Even though the facilities werent the best, I would consider returning for her massage."
3,"I hate having to give out three star reviews. For me, 1-star isnt the worst possible rating you can an establishment, a 3 is. Because 3 stars means it invoked no reaction to you, neither joy or disgust, no pleasure or pain.  Id rather eat at a really shitty place that Ill remember than a so-so eatery that Ill forget the moment I get back into my truck. If I want mediocre ""take it or leave it"" food Ill just cook for myself, kthxbye. As BFeFs (Best Frienemies Forever), Clarice W and I frequently have lunch together in the Peoria area. The decision on what to eat is usually made using the following criteria: Where havent we been that we can yelp about? Our last lunch involved us going to Hope Kee and getting all wrapped up in their cutesy snack section and coming in late to work. So we needed somewhere relatively closer with no Hello Kitty gummi lips to distract us from our voyage back. Clarice suggested Casa Filipina, a Filipino place by the Lennys Burger somewhere near but not necessarily 35th Avenue. We were welcomed in by the staff and taken immediately to a nice cozy table by the window. We were given our menus by the excited and talkative waiter I would come later to know as ""that fucking guy"".  At first I was a little troubled reading the menu. I was once in a relationship with a Filipino girl that was so tumultuous and unloving that when I seriously thought of breaking up with her that my first thought ""but  man, I love her mothers cooking..."".  But aside from the adobo and lumpia, I saw nothing else on the menu that I could recall from all those awkward awkward family dinners. I cant tell if this means theres more to the cuisine than Im aware of or that said exs mother was, as well as a good cook, a fucking liar.  Either way, Im glad I left her in the end anyway. I ordered the Dinguan, which translates as ""chocolate pork"". Dont be fooled by the name, all you saucy foodies out there thinking of that Iron Chef America where they made savory dishes with chocolate. Chocolate pork is actually pork cooked in pigs blood.  Ill repeat that. Its pigs blood. Its called ""chocolate pork"" because the blood takes on a brownish-black hue after its been cooked. After hearing this from that fucking guy, Clarice changed her original order (we even order the same thing! arent we just the cutest!) to the Bistek Tagalog, which she was familiar with and knew she would like. All the entries come with at CFB is a side of ride. Im not sure if its jasmine, white, or saffron, because I always opt for noodles when given the option.  And if you get that fucking guy, that rice doesnt even come with soy sauce. After serving us, he disappeared into the bakery, talking it up with some of the other customers. Clarice didnt get her soy sauce until after we had finished our entrees and were on our second helping of rice.  Thankfully my chocolate pork came with a lot of sauce and I was able to dribble it on my rice.  Thats right, muchachos. We trannies prefer blood on our rice. You think about that the next time you try to tell us what bathrooms we can use, amigo. I couldnt taste the pork. All I tasted was the blood. They couldve just dumped a quart of blood on my rice and called it a day. The texture was nice though. Clarice wasnt as fortunate with her dish. While Ive tried to stay away from beef (its enough of a commitment to keep my vegetarian brother off my back but not interfere with my eating habits), I had some of the Bistek, and it was passable. It reminded me of beef jerky, with its dry spicy roughness. Good, but not sure if thats how its meant to taste. Moral of the story: Clarices entree did NOT make its own gravy, which made eating her rice a little inconvenient.  And seriously, JUST rice (really good rice, but seriously, how hard is it to make good rice)? Even my neighborhood so-poor-it-steals-its-recipes-from-other-restaurants Chinese place gives you an eggroll or wonton with your meal.  As the place is so fucking proud of its desserts, we ordered some. Clarice got the Creme Brulee and I got the mango tart. That fucking guy was in the middle of bringing Clarice her spoon when he caught the attention of another customer, so we sat for a good few minutes waiting to dig in. In the meantime, I managed to come up with a name for the color of the filling in my tart : burnt earwax.  My tart was about as tasty and edible as that term would imply. Clarices creme brulee was good, albeit a little cold by the time that fucking guy came with her spoon. On our way out I learned that the bill had to be over 10 dollars before they would accept debit. After I imagined beating every one of the staff near to death with a rolling pin, I got an eclair to go. What I got was a bunch of whipped cream between two pieces of rock-hard pastry that youd get at Frys. Essentially, a diabetes sandwich. Casa Filipina isnt good. But its not bad. Thats the proble"
5,"I am a huge Suns fan but my review is about the fundraising options that the Suns have to offer as well as their back-office staff. First and foremost, talk about a professional, classy organization. Whether you have fundraising experience or are a total novice, the staff treats you like you are the only group they are working with. My contact is Kyle Pottinger and he is always a gentleman. No matter what questions I have, he always answers them promptly and never makes me feel like Im bothering him.  The fundraising process is easy and the tickets practically sell themselves because who doesnt want the chance to purchase discounted tickets?  The process is easy and the rewards can be lucrative depending on the target audience you are working with. The Suns will treat you professionally and courteously. You wont be disappointed."
4,"If you can avoid the vintage smell youre golden.  I walked in - smelled grandmas place with a hint of Goodwill and decided to get myself acclimated and walked about the store. They have quite the selection of vintage furniture, jewelry, and clothes. I fell in love with a few jackets but was all about trying some phosphates and getting my munch on.  Playing it safe I first ordered the cherry lime phosphate BUT holy carbonation they have a long list of flavors that all sounded if not yummy definitely interesting.  The food is so good - my chicken salad sandwich was fantastic and came with the best potato salad Ive ever had (dont tell my mom).  I was going to order the champagne phosphate but my pinup girl waitress steered me into getting the pineapple. It was so sweet and not very pineappley but still good.  For the lady who made a post about no french fries I just want to say, really???  Its nice to have other options and they keep it simple, unique and delicious. I cant wait to share this place with my friends and family."
5,"This place is what Desert Ridge wishes it was! Its great for groceries (Wal-Mart), bargain hunting (TJ Maxx), fast food or dining in (tons of places!), catching a movie (Harkins), stocking up the wine shelf (BevMo), new panties (Vickys Secret) and a zillion other things. I love that this is close to my house! The only thing that would make it better is a Costco or Sams Club."
5,"Id leave my Scottsdale bubble for a few reasons (and yes there are additional exceptions) 1. Nobuo at Teeter House. 2. Fez. 3. My friends in various parts of the valley and  4. Mekong Supermarket. I consider myself to be a huge fan of Asian cuisine. Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Korean, Indian. You name it, Ill eat it. I have my healthy moments, but I am a seasoned eater and I am not afraid of exploring the world through my palate. Mekong is the perfect place for me to massage my senses. The aroma and sensations from the exotic product. The stunning visual of a catfish being bopped on the head, and then cut up and packaged. The cheesy elevator music on the loudspeaker. The delicious taste of a spring roll from the hot food bar.  This place has it all. I usually come here for my Asian condiments and live seafood. Want a live crab? Boom. Done. Want spicy mustard or sriracha in a large bottle for cheap? Its yours. To me, there is nothing like taking the 10 mile drive in traffic to Mekong because I know I am going to get everything I want.  Make the trek. You wont regret it."
5,"This is a dangerous place for me. I could seriously do my bank account some damage as I love love love this store! The candles are the best anywhere. They burn very clean and the fragrance lasts until they burn out. I just bought the kumquat scented candles and they smell delish. Theres so many cool home furnishings here as well, unique non-mainstream stuff thats fairly reasonable in $$. Ive actually got my eye on this really cool apothecary cabinet... purchasing it may be in my very near future!"
3,"i know theyre doing their jobs and i can understand that. but we couldnt shake our saleslady. we finally had to say that if she didnt leave us alone, we were going to leave. we absolutely couldnt discuss anything because she was CONSTANTLY THERE! we even said well come find you if we need any help. literally any piece we glanced at, touched, or came near, she was on top of us ""oh isnt this a great piece. we can set up financing and lock in the sales price, and if you buy 5k worth today with cash, well throw in...etc"". every single item.  they have nice stuff, no question about that. but i know this game. and its not fun. it makes shopping miserable. and besides, its too expensive for us. we got 3 of the same, exact pieces (same model, same sku) at pruitts for less than half we would have paid at Ashleys."
4,"Okay before I get into the drinks, Ill start with the food.  My fave is the peppered turkey avocado sandwich, with these delicious fries.   Or, (Amber: note the paragraph change) you could get the chili verde appetizer, or the grilled shrimp and guac tostada bites, or the tejas trio with guac, queso, and salsa and chips.   Bottom line is the food is solid, all the way up to the fruit cobbler for dessert.  Settle for nothing less.  For drinks, Z caps you at 3 margaritas so make it count with the chambord rita before you switch to beers.  Its good, youll be flavored, life is perfect."
5,Have alread posted a review but had to add that a friend at work ordered vegan chocolate cupcakes for my birthday and they were sooooooo delicious!! All my nonvegan coworkers LOVED them.
5,Heard about this restaurant from a friend and I was amaze by the food and their friendly service. I tried the chicken adobo and it was amazing! The chicken came apart with no effort and it had a great honey glazed taste. The portions were a good amount for their low prices. I couldnt  get enough of their amazing dessert!
4,Great place to go have a beer and watch the game on one of there numerous televisions.
5,"With our regular Indian place converted to buffet and my lunch companions refusing to go (dont tell them, but I would go anyway), it was time to find a new Indian spot for the work lunch rotation.  We were on a mission and I was trying to figure out whether Jewel would be added to the list of acceptable lunch haunts.  After managing a circuitous route to the top floor of a parking garage, we navigated a maze like structure of corridors to find the restaurant.  Travel time was starting to negate Jewel from the list.  The lunch menu was small, and we all ordered the thali meat combination.    After a modest wait time the food arrived in an array of metal containers and was delicious.  I hope we go back, but majority rules."
5,"LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!! Best Mexican food we have had in Arizona yet. We are partial as we just bought in Fountain Hills and its close, but its also small and although lively, never crowded or noisy. The service is friendly and fast and the Mexican style music is great but not too loud. You can easily talk and relax. Loved the guacomole dip and shrimp cocktail and the fried ice cream is fab and big enough for four people!!!"
5,"Ah what a beauty and wonder Camelback mountain is. However I do warn beginners to use the easier trail on the East side near Invergorden which runs north south and turns into 64th st. It is a bit of a walk from the parking through the neighborhood but the hike is less treacherous and much easier and takes you up a gradual slope to the top. Be very careful its easy to loose the trail on that side too.  Of course all the Phoenicians like to go to Echo Canyon at Mcdonald and 44th street bend. Parking can be bad at peak times on weekends--I definetely recommend late afternoon hiking, less exhaustion from heat, less crowds and a glorious sunset at the top.  Happy Hiking my Dear Phoenicians."
4,"Ive spent more time than I need to remember in hotel bars and restaurants, and they all kind of fade into a blurry, nebulous, mass.  District, however, stands out. From their pork sliders and bacon wrapped dates on happy hour, to their cold and juuust right gin martinis, I dont think they hit a flat patch the whole week I was there, and I stopped by at least once a day. The bartender I had, Matt, was funny, smart, sweet, and made me feel like I had a friend in Phoenix. The experience was more than I could have asked for from a hotel restaurant, and if I stay in the area again I will definitely go back."
5,This QT is one of my favorite locations! It is always very clean and the staff is upbeat!
5,One of my favorite places to come. Their salsa and guacamole is to die for. I like that they bring each person their own individual bowl of salsa.  I ways get their huevos rancheros with beans and rice + homemade flour tortilla. Delicious!!! I eat the entire plate every time.
4,Great prices and fresh food ...
4,"For those of you planning to visit us, Babaloos is no more.  For those of you who know us I just wanted to take a minute to leave a heartfelt thank you. When someone opens a new restaurant it is an exciting moment, a nervous moment, a scary moment all rolled into one.  If the worst thing that happens is a rack of wine glasses falling from the roof in a hail of glass then the opening can be considered a success-many have endured far more nightmarish openings in this industry.   As the weeks, months, and years go by a funny thing happens to the special restaurants, the good restaurants: they begin to feel like family and people come back.  This was where I came in, almost a year ago today, as a simple restaurant server with over 10 years of previous restaurant management experience.  I was not the best server, but I noticed that both customers and employees alike were always grateful, and made me feel at home.  This was the beauty of Babaloos-it felt like family.   To Robert, Myra, George, Adam, Emily, Jon, Rob, Erika, and anyone I may have forgotten I offer my deepest thanks for allowing me to be part of your lives.  To all of the wonderful people who came to see us over and over again, I would far prefer to work a table seated with people I know, and you all never failed to help me out with that.  Babaloos did not close because of the folks that supported us, it closed because sometimes in the bleakest economy a business fails, even despite the greatest efforts of those trying to keep it going.  It was a fun ride.  Thanks Rob!"
4,"Two times a year, you can meander down Mill Ave and the adjoining streets to look at an array of art for sale. Everything from jewelry and pop art posters to handmade kitchen utensils, photography and abstract paintings.  If you go both in Spring and Winter, youre likely to see a few of the same artists. For the most part, Tempe Arts Festival does a great job of providing variety. Plus, its fun to wander and look at things you may not have seen before - let alone expected to see at an arts festival.  This isnt the most exciting of art festivals. Theres really no live music, unless you count the occasional melodies of flutes you hear when you walk by the vendor selling his handmade wooden flutes.  Ive been three times and enjoyed myself every time. I wasnt wowed. I never saw anything I couldnt live without. But, like I said, this is a fun event to mark on your calender for both Spring and Winter - even if it happens to rain during the festival.  I give last Winters and this Springs festivals both a 4-star review, for the weather and company were great. It was my first year going, and I was happy to see that Tempe offered the Valley something that appealed to people who really do try and appreciate art. After all, its a ""consumer"" type of event, geared toward bringing the community and artists together. I can appreciate that.  I give this Winters festival a 3-star review. The rain didnt phase me. I can deal with a few sprinkles. What bothered me was the mixing of ASU and UofA fans, both groups beginning to gather down on Mill Ave for the football showdown. Dont get me wrong, I love a good sporting event and understand team rivalry. I just thought it was unfortunate that the upcoming game and the fans excitement took over the relaxed, casual feel that the arts festival usually has - you know, when you can walk down the street and look at art without running into an impromptu cheer section.  You see, fans were screaming in the streets - hollering insults to the other team - and waving their schools colors high. (Once again, I understand the fun of that. I just didnt expect it to be all over the streets in the early afternoon. Maybe Im naive, though.) The fans were a definite distraction from the art festival. Knowing what would happen when alcohol was mixed into the equation, my friend and I decided to bolt.  Lucky we did. Seems like Tempe cant handle a few rain droplets, for when we were walking back to the car, a street lamp post nearly fell on our heads. Talk about a commotion.  Id much rather attention be fixed on the art festival rather than any football game or falling lamp posts, no matter how dramatic both of those things can be. I spose this echoes the old saying, ""Theres a time and place for everything."" Word to the wise: Parking can be hard to find, or require you to shell out $10 for a spot. If you can, park somewhere closeby thats free of charge and hoof it on foot."
2,"The doctors are great, especially Dr Mouaikel but the set up to communicate is not patient oriented at all .  When the office is closed for lunch 12-2PM you cannot even leave a message .  You need to call back again and listen to the lenghtly preamble about directions , office hours, emergency numbers etc.  You still have to press the correct number and leave a phone number for a return call.  The return call is late that day or even the next day. The recording suggests yiu use the website yet you have to be signed up for the website and I cannot find out on the website how you get signed up.   I would rather go to the DMV rather than have to call the AIA office for other than an appointment.."
4,"Sadly, this Souper Salad has closed.     :-("
5,Amanda was very helpful when we looking at the ferrits.....   A great pet store.
4,"Impressed  , stopped 2 x before and the wait was to long . Made reservations for 5 this time.;).. Friends had recommened and raved about Becketts and had this on the short list for awhile. It was everything as advertised, ambiance very casual , GOOD Food, excellent service (  Adria was very good and made good recommendations ) and fair prices . Recommend the Osso  Bucco pork but not a bad meal by the group . Sunday is AZ winery special which is a nice touch , must try the Pimms cup cocktail excellent! Cant wait to go back!,!,"
3,"The parking situation is ridiculous, seriously. If you can, walk/bike/bus. Its not worth the energy/effort otherwise. Another downside? If you dont make 6 figures, dont plan on buying anything here. Seriously. Nothing lends itself to everyday people. Except for m                   aybe Borders (outside of food options). My most recent venture there was on a Fri afternoon and it was PACKED and we literally could not eat anywhere without a decent wait and we were starving... so we were stuck. The bonus is the MoJo, Borders & Paradise there. But nothing else lends itself to my medicore income."
1,"Id have to disagree with the person who said this restaurant is dog friendly.  I was told off by the owner because I had a little dog outside table and that was right after I finished paying for an overpriced breakfast dish and coffee.  I went here before that on several occasions and many times my order was forgotten, after paying....and the staff is real unprofessional blasting music at nightclub volume at early breakfast and lunch times.  Im a neighbor, but will never go here again!!!!"
2,This is a lake.   It has water in it.  Its not very clean water.   The lake police will yell at you if you let your dog swim in the water. That sucks.   I think its semi-retarded to review a lake.
4,"While my partner and I dont normally like chain restaurants Ling & Louies is an exception. Theyre a small chain of only two restaurants they are franchising.  We both started with Miso soup which was okay. Then we moved on to Potstickers, on of our favorites. they were very good, but not outstanding. For our entrees I ordered Firecracker Chicken with Broccoli and my partner ordered Meatball Sliders. The Chicken was VERY spicy, but also very good. I didnt have room to try the Meatball Sliders but here they were also very good. All-in-all it was a pretty good meal and the service was perfect."
5,"In my opinion, one of the best steakhouses in town.  My husband and I go here for all our special occasions and have never had one bad meal.  The service is the best just like their steaks.  I recommend the Caesar salad, fillet, creamed spinach, cream corn, garlic and lobster mashed potatoes.  We will continue our tradition and keep coming back here."
5,Sundae for Sunday. Pink spot helps me go through the summer heat.
3,"Its unfair to review this mall on what it was - since it no longer is (and what it is isnt as good as what it was). Its also unfair to review this on what it will be - since it isnt that yet.  Today, its a mall I rarely visit. Apart from a few stores I would visit out of convenience or necessity, theres not much to offer compared to what it used to have. The fantastic movie theater, Jutenhoops, Alpine Ski Keller, Bear Cover, and even Ed Debevics are all long gone... oops, there I go bringing up the past. Seriously though, these were painful to lose - one by one. So today, theres a Linens n Things which is hardly unique, and a Trader Joes which is nice to have in the area, and also a Sisters Attic and Closet upscale thrift stores which add a bit of much-needed flavor. The Chilis, the Bookstar, and Black Angus are still around. So is the jewelry store that has never really offered a compelling reason to enter. Theyve wedged an LA Fitness here and theyve also added a Blimpie and an Arbys... all very healthy choices.  Besides all of the generic shops and eateries and standard offerings, theres still a few unique experiences - though nothing like it used to... shit, there I go again. Anyway, so theres a few places that arent screaming ""standard mall"" such as Pita Grill, a pipe and tobacco shoppe (you have to spell it that way in this case), a place to get eyewear, and some other small and uninteresting businesses.  In that sense, I suppose this is has become a decent and convenient neighborhood strip mall. This is a shame really since its lacking most of the key elements that made it really special. Its still a beautiful outdoor mall and the architecture alone makes it a unique alternative to the cookie-cutter malls that strategically litter the landscape of America.  Im worried about what theyll do to the architecture when they renovate this place someday, but I think the fact that this mall isnt terribly interesting anymore in general means it wont be so terribly missed when they lose that last remaining bit of ""special."""
5,"I found this little hot spot on Yelp and used my phone to navigate me there; I wouldnt have found it otherwise.  This small establishment is hidden in a neighborhood right off of Historic Downtown Chandler.  Its a quaint little diner with modest décor.  I felt very comfortable there and the service was fast and friendly.  As I looked over the menu the first thing I saw was the Morning Monte and havarti cheese as one of the ingredients.  Cheddar isnt better; its all about havarti folks!  I neednt look further; I knew thats what I was having.  Hawaiian bread French toast, bacon, turkey, egg and the havarti - absolutely delicious!  Cant wait to come back and bring everyone I know."
5,I love this place. They are so accommodating and the food is delicious. They made a special meal for my daughter and were happy to do it. Our server was helpful and friendly.  I had the roasted beet salad and the ingredients were very fresh and tasty. I cant wait to go back.
1,"Im sad to report that we dined here for lunch and it was inedible:(  Chef Aaron please come by and monitor your staff.  We had the eggplant sandwich and is was a disaster.  It was so overly oily and the bun and fries overwhelmed the plate.  The shrimp and grits were so average with the shrimp being of low quality.  The beer menu looked fabulous.  So I guess if this is just a watering hole things will be fine...but if you choose to dine be prepared to leave hungry and unsatisfied.  We hope this turns around.  The decor is cool and the staff is really fun and helpful...and we are hopeful for a great place to visit in the ""hood""."
4,"I love this place, saves me and my family some serious cash. I do agree with allot of the other reviewers on the meat and produce - my wife gets those from the store across the street.  I also love the fact that they have a Sushi shop inside the store. Makes a great quick snack. The lady the works there will make almost anything you want. And, you can call in your ""order"" ahead if needed. She (or her son) have never let me down in quality and freshness of the Sushi."
5,"Chino Bandido is a staple for my sister and I. Im not going to lie, when describing this place I feel the need to mention that while its not much to look at on the outside--inside it delivers some of my favorite guilty pleasures. I encourage anyone who is trying this place for the first time to take a few minutes and allow the staff to guide you thru what they have to offer. With their complimentary taste test , you can try a few of their most popular dishes and learn how to order off of their moderately challenging menu (but once you get it, its super easy). I ALWAYS go for the combination of double jade red chicken, refried beans, and plain fried rice. The snickerdoodle at the end is perfectly baked. Every time. Love this place."
3,"Chain restaurant thats just about okay for afternoon dining with friends. If I wasnt having beer at lunch Id probably suggest eating someplace else. Food is good but in my experience their beer makes the meal. Ive eaten here about half a dozen times during the past few years when in town for business weekends. It is centrally located on the corner of Mill and Fifth Street in downtown Tempe, amongst quite a few other local restaurants. During my most recent visit I ordered a steak at lunch along with one of the seasonal brewed beers. Steak was okay but I wouldnt order it again. Beer was exceptional, so I wasnt unhappy overall. I love burgers and I think Ill stick to that as my primary choice when eating here in the future. I cant think of any times when service was particularly unsatisfactory, nor were there times when service really stood out as exceptional. I have almost always eaten here on a Saturday afternoon, and its typically been fairly busy during the lunch hour. Never had a problem getting a table, which is important since Im usually heading back for an afternoon conference session. I love the big glass beer mugs (not sure what size they are) but I cant always down the whole thing during a short lunch break (Im a lightweight). Overall, good place to eat if youre hungry and in the downtown area, but I wouldnt go out of my way to get here."
5,A great value for a far superior hair cut than are likely to get from a national chain.  We have been going to Tara for 3 years and she has created a warm and friendly environment that kids love.  There are plenty of TVs for kids to watch a show if they are not big fans of haircuts.
4,standard Target.
5,"I was there just last night, and today received a ROTD for my original review. Too weird. Updates - They mix a great margarita! No fluorescent green pre mixed Margarita mix - they make it themselves with fresh lime juice. Yum. The wine list is small but good. My current fave is the Argentinian Malbec.  Its only $6 a glass, and they pour generously. Very tasty wine. The seating is not comfy if you like to slouch. If you sit up straight, its fine. But seriously.... good posture is over rated. It gets a little cold in there once in a while during the winter. Wear long sleeves. :) After 3 glasses of the Malbec last night, I didnt care. This place has really been growing on me... nice to have such a great neighborhood watering hole!"
3,I am not going to complain about the quality of my manicure! They did a fabulous job...On the other hand their customer service was a little off. Very unorganized and they could just not get it together. It took them forever to assist us since we didnt have an appointment and are not regulars.
3,"I may have to disagree with the majority of reviews of this restaurant.  We came here after my parents played a round of golf. With their round they got two free steak dinner, which they raved about... not sure if it was more on the fact that they were tasty or that they were free, which today can be just as exciting.  I ordered the Coconut Shrimp with Sweet Potato Fries, and although this is a large plate of fried concoctions, it was delicious! I could not ask for a more crispy, summer-y meal.  There were some problems with the service, we had a dirty glass and a bad glass of wine. But they were very helpful in recognizing their fault and fixing the problem.  There was karaoke playing the night we were there, which was interesting, but not the creme of the crop participants if you catch my drift.  So if you are a  golfer and looking for a great place to go after your round, stop by."
5,"This is the best ice cream Ive ever had, bar none!  I had the salted caramel, and it was wonderful!  I felt like I was 7 years old and enjoying my first ever ice cream cone.  I also love the decor of the shop, the braille on the back wall is so cool (although I do wonder exactly what it says!)  I also bought a pint of their ice cream at Whole Foods, I love Sweet Republic and everything it stands for!  Totally recommended!"
5,"Great service, I didnt get steak from here (yes, I know...a steakhouse), just got the Zesty Thai Salmon. The salmon was awesome with the chili mayo, baked potato, and asparagus. Cant wait to go back to try their other dishes. Thank you Kathy (owner) for taking the time to send me the name of the dish! Had to update this review and rating because of it :D"
5,"I did not expect such a great find in a such a nondescript location. I went there looking for a very odd beer. Not only did they have it, they had tons of it. The guy behind the counter was helpful as soon as I walked in, and showed me exactly what I needed. They know what they sell very well, and can give excellent recommendations on whatever you might be looking for. It was great to talk shop with someone who obviously knew his stuff."
5,"Great selection, TONS of flavor, always hot and fresh, nice staff, great prices. In my top 3 quick restaurants."
4,"It was a Sunday morning & Mimis was PACKED! We walked in, gave the hostess our name & told the wait wouldnt be too long considering it was just the two of us. The décor was French quarter New Orleans-themed, with Parisian style knick knacks & art work abound. A bit on the kitchy side, but quite nifty IMO! What I found to be not only impressive but wise was that they had free coffee, mini muffins & sample size nut loafs for the waiting patrons, which mostly consisted of seniors & families.  Following the hostess to our table, I couldnt help but notice, the humongous portion size of ALL of their dishes.  The menu had so many mouth watering choices, but considering I was feeling ill, I ordered a bowl of granola & a (YU-MMY) buttermilk spice muffin. Boring I know, but lemme make it up to you by talking about moms dish, the 3 egg avocado & crab omelet which was made w/ jack cheese, tomatoes, scallions, bacon & asiago cream sauce, accompanied by red potatoes, choice of one of their mega-sized (hot & fresh) muffins & fresh squeezed O.J.  The service was on the slow side, perhaps understaffed or just overwhelmed, but our waiter made it up to us by giving me choice of beverage & extra muffins, no charge.  For those of you who want healthier options, dont you fret, they offer a Fresh & Fit menu as well.  All in all, I really enjoyed my dining experience @ this Mimis location & will definitely return if Im ever back in Phoenix."
5,"Screw Disneyland- Sephora is the happiest place on earth!  They have everything a girly girl or a girly guy could possibly dream of and then some! They have all the best brands in cosmetics, skin care and perfume and theyre always adding new items to their extensive product selection.  To me, getting a gift card to Sephora is like having Christmas morning over and over again.  Everywhere you look there are sparkly blushes, lip plumping glosses, lash-extending mascaras and anti-aging face creams- what more could anyone ask for? I can understand why men might hate going into Sephora- but they do have some products for guys too- although not many.  As far as I know, Scottsdale Fashion Square is home to the only Sephora in Scottsdale, but even as great as it is, it still cant beat the one right on the strip in Vegas.  Theyre open really late and you can shop with a drink in your hand- what could be better than that?"
5,"I rarely go to Indian restaurants. But this is a place I love to visit often. The food seems as if it was done with great interest. When u go there, order anything with rice. They cook it to perfection. I like their handi dishes a lot. If there is one thing I can suggest, it is that they should stop adding food coloring to some of their dishes. No need to guild this Lilly!"
4,"Lunch was delicious, as usual. I had the bruschetta trio for the first time and I couldnt find anything wrong with it, much as I tried to. Not even the onions bothered me. And if you know me, you know how much I hate onions. But their bruschetta was so full of all my favorite flavors I couldnt even complain about the onions. Now thats saying something."
1,"The absolute worse service Ive encountered. My boyfriend, son and I sat at a tepan table, we were ignored for a good 15-20 minutes until my boyfriend had to ask the manager to please have someone get us something to drink. Once we had our drinks, it took another 20 minutes to order our food. By that time, another family sat at our table. My son & boyfriend ordered a meal from the tepan menu, I had sushi. Everyone on that table got their meal and I still didnt get my sushi. I asked the server to please bring it and she brought someone elses order, I had to wait another 20 minutes for my sushi. The family on our table were so upset for us as well.  The food is excellent, the service is so poor I am disappointed. I advise anyone who comes here to sit at the sushi bar and deal with the Chefs, they are great. I talked to the owner and she was just as bad as the servers.  I then gave it another try. I met my girlfriends there. We had dinner, spent over $200. We then moved over to the bar area and were completely forgotten about. We asked the manager/owner to please have someone come take care of us and we were told that they were concerned because we were drinking and had kids with us. One of my girlfriends had her kids but she was not drinking. I was offended that she tried to cover up the poor service with her so-called concern.  Again, food is great service is lousy. I am so disappointed and will not go back. I will look elsewhere for my Caliente Rolls. I hear Blu at the Wigwam is really good and servers are hospitable."
1,"I wouldve gone 2 stars if I were more forgiving. I could reason that it was the end of the day, that a big crowd of wayward children had just come through, or that a hurricane had blown out the back of the restaurant. But then, I tasted it. It looks as if Yogurtini is pretty well-loved around these parts, and Im sorry to report otherwise. Its was like a bomb had gone off. The tables were filthy, the machine handles were all gunked up, there was assorted debris on the floor. The two teenagers working were too busy gossiping about who knows what to do their jobs. When we walked in there were a few customers sampling flavors among the ruins, with no employees in sight. We grabbed some sample cups from the register and dodged napkins and froyo puddles (and other customers) to try some different flavors. The levers are the type that if you pull just a bit too far you make a mess all over your hand, especially when trying to squirt a tiny bit in a sample cup. This mess is then added to the greater mess of everyone else attempting this same operation, and no-one attempting to clean it up. The stuff was real overpowering, to where instead of tasting like what it was supposed to taste like, it was bordering on medicine or like a bad imitation of what it was supposed to be. Like, cheesecake doesnt taste like that, good cheesecake anyway... And neither does cake batter, or banana. Where did the yogurt part go? And how do you screw up cookies and cream, exactly? The two that were the best (and most edible) were the Irish mint and the red velvet, and thats what we mostly ended up with. The decor didnt add to our experience. Everything is a mint green, but it doesnt come off as retro or even minty, but more like dated and hospital-like. Some people really like it but I found it unappetizing. A surly teenager magically appeared as we approached the register, only to disappear again soon after we paid. We sat down at a dirty table and dealt with our choices while the two teens again made an appearance, half-mopping-half-attempting-to-clean while chattering back and forth about their dating woes. We finished our yogurt but both strongly considered abandoning the whole affair. I very well could have walked into Yogurtini at the worst possible time on the worst possible day, with all the factors stacked against them, but I wont be returning to find out if this was the case."
4,"Its a chain, but eating with my fingers, whats not to like. Im a wimp in the spicy department so, I dont often eat buffalo hot wings because everyone Im with orders the ""hot"" ones.  I like the sauce options at Wild Wings and the and the wings are meaty. I had the Parmesan Garlic and the Asian Zing. Its also cool that small portions are available so I was able to order 2 versions. I was able to tolerate the Asian Zing, so maybe Ill try the mild or even medium classic versions next time. My hubby ordered the Jerk Chicken Sandwich and he really liked it. The onion rings were pretty darn good, too.  The only thing negative on this visit was the sucky Berry Lemonade made with Minute Maid Lemonade, I thought for the price it would have been fresh squeezed, but alas I did not read the small type."
4,The first thing that sticks out in my mind was the service.  Our waitress was all smiles and incredibly adorable! Edamame was perfectly steamed Sushi was tasty Salmon Teriyaki was delicious sake and kirin washed it all down prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is calming.
5,"My husband and I chose Binkleys for our 5th anniversary dinner. We dont usually spend that much on a meal, but for a special occasion we decided to splurge, and we are soooo glad we did. We decided to do the 4 course tasting meal, and with the many amuse bouches throughout the meal we left so full, I couldnt even finish my wonderful seared foie gras. The atmosphere was cosy and inviting, the wait staff friendly and helpful. The three hours we spent enjoying our meal was well spent. We would both like to revisit and enjoy another taste adventure with this lovely resturant."
2,"The manager at this location is a pretentious jerk, he is condescending and immature.  I will never return to this place or recommend it.  The food is delicious, the atmosphere is sophisticated but the crowd is lame and the management is even worse. Spend your evening and your money elsewhere."
5,"I came in for a gift for my boyfriends pleasure.  The lady working there answered my questions thoroughly and professionally.  Any shyness or awkwardness I might have felt disappeared.  I was prepared to spend more for a different product but was steered to a better choice by this lady.  Turns out, my boyfriend was very happy with his gift.  This was around Halloween so there were a lot more items than usual like costumes, pasties... fun things.  I can wholeheartedly recommend this Fascinations!"
5,"Food is good to the tummy. To me this is better than in and out burger. Place is spotless,  friendly service, and wide selection."
1,"One star would be giving it a holiday gift! For me Copper Star Coffee Shop has been a place where consistency and pride is taken in their food and presentation. Unfortunately, Circle H BBQ is nothing like the prior statement. My first visit to Circle H BBQ centered on ordering a half slap of ribs. They were extremely over-cooked.  There was more charcoal on the top, back and ends that was just not editable.  Once you scraped away the charcoal, on the tops, ends and the center ribs, there was one that was eatable.  The company offered me a second chance to try their food, by giving me a complementary full slap.  Nothing had improved. They say they smoke the ribs, but there was no odor to that effect. In face the ribs I ordered the second time spend over 20 minutes on the grill after the order was placed. Btw...the waitress at the front counter couldnt even tell be the type of rub on the ribs and the type of cut they were. When I asked if they were smoked (cooked) daily, she said some are if you get here early - others were from the refrigerator from last night. The so called ""dry-rub"" seasoning was tasteless. The BBQ sauce is major strange! The bottom line is the ribs were not worth the cost they were charging. ($14/Half for 6 bones and $26/Whole 12-13 bones both with sides) I have high hopes for the brisket, but it might be a while untill I try that endeavor. Overall if they dont change the way they burn"" the ribs, run, run or drive real fast to another place.  The charcoal is not good for you and there is lots of it! Honey Bears, My Mothers or even driving to Famous Daves is well worth the trip. Sorry to burst your bubble, I too, had high hops for a centrally located rib place.   Im still waiting."
5,Love it and love the GF menu.  Its amazing how many dishes they have
3,"Ok first off, with the demise of Soma and the fact that Green is in Tempe.....this place is a welcome sight, and I know Ill be back. The food is excellent. However I feel that Dr Weil has has has the wool pulled over his eyes by Mr. Fox. Come one ""Anazazi Beans"" and a drink called the ""Medicine Man""? Really- as an American Indian rights advocate youd think wed be past this. Actually, youd think educated white men with lots of money would be past this --but ya know. Just because Anazazi really refers to Ancestral Pueblo people who lived mainly in NM and N. AZ and means ""ancient enemy"" in Navajo so that term isnt used by nearly ANYONE anymore...means that you probaby shouldnt call your dish by that name. Other than that- I give em props for trying. I recently had another experience there where EVERYTHING was going wrong that night, and the staff recovered....kinda. My advice, shape up if ya wanna last."
5,"Green is by far one of my favorite restaurants to eat at.  My husband loves it too and he is a carnivore!  Our favorite things to get are the ""boneless buffalo wings"" and something that another customer shared with me while waiting in line that is not on the menu ""the Wendys pickle sandwich"" It is amazing!  Another special they have from time to time is ""the big WAC"" and I must say it is better than the real thing!!!!!"
3,"Haus Murphys was my first German food experience ever. The cuisine was OK but it isnt something Id shove people down to get to.  I went with a friend who lived in Germany for a bit and he said that Murphys wasnt quite up to par.  We ordered the sausage sampler as an appetizer. The sausages were tasty, but they were a bit cold. For something that is labeled a ""sampler"", I felt disappointed with only two types of sausages served in it. I dont know for sure what types they were, but they didnt taste unique to me, as it seems like you can purchase them in the meat section of any supermarket.  The sausages were served with three types of condiments. A sweet style mustard, a Dijon style mustard, and ketchup blended with curry, which Im told is a recent favorite of the German kids brought over from Turkish immigrants.  For our entrees, we all had some type of schnitzel. That same friend told me to try the Wiener schnitzel as it is the representative item when you think of German cuisine. So all our schnitzels came out and mine was the blandest. My friends schnitzels had different gravies, toppings, and stuff and my poor little Wiener schnitzel was just bland and all alone. You have to get that Wiener schnitzel wet with gravy !  No biggie, Im a foodie so Ill eat it. A schnitzel is basically German country fried pork. Not super exciting. I copied my friend who lived in Germany and substituted potatoes on the side for spatzle, as I wanted this experience to be as authentic as possible. I dont know if its just Haus Murphys, but the spatzle was kind of bland, even with the gravy.  I do however like the word spatzle. If I ever visited Germany, I would only say spatzle, to everyone. I also liked the other thing that was served with the entree. It was kind of like a mashed potato mixed with some creme sauce, onions and some kind of green vegetable or herb (probably spinach).  The beer here was good authentic German beer. I didnt get drunk, but I still dont remember what kind I had, youll have to experiment.  Service was excellent. I read some reviews that said Murphys was slow but everything came out quickly and evenly for us. The waitress was very friendly and they spoke lovely German (not that I speak ANY German, but it sounded sexy). She was very helpful in describing everything, from the food to the beer. I ordered a BAP (big ass pretzel) to go. Philly is known for some pretty good pretzels and this BAP was good. It was expensive, but it came out warm, soft & chewy. The only thing is they went a little heavy on the salt.  To steal and modify a quote from a Seinfeld episode: ""That big ass pretzel made me thirsty""!   Note* They dont actually have it on the menu as a BAP. Would I return to Murphys? Ehhh, yeah to try some of the other things, but I definitely cant see it as a place that I would be a regular at."
5,This is one of the best Asian meals you may ever eat. They are amazingly inexpensive for lunch too. The house fried rice and the wonton soup are perfection. The Lincoln location is prettier but the food is the same.
3,"Is Jimmy single?  Cause if he is, Id like to introduce myself. Nice local Italian spot.   Decent prices. Friendly service.   Antipasta salad was great, lots of goodies for the money.  Meatballs and Italian sausage were okay bu the spicy sauce was great. I will be back to try the pizza, get another salad and ask if Jimmy is around."
5,"I am OBSESSED with Ra.  Thank God that it is a chain restaurant otherwise I dont know how I would get my fix when in different states.  I dont care what everyone says about the best sushi, blah blah blah.  This place is THE best! First of all it has the BEST happy hour!  I was introduced to the restaurants best items during happy hour when it was less expensive to be adventurous.  My absolute favorites are the Sweet Onion Salmon, Salmon Carpaccio and Shishito Peppers.  The Sweet Onion Salmons sauce is to die for, the Salmon Carpaccio is soft and creamy with a nice kick of wasabi and the Shishito Peppers have the most amazing garlic-type sauce!  I usually order the peppers with a side of white rice and drizzle the sauce on it for a more filling meal.   Other favorites are the RAckin shrimp, Uchi No Salad and Vegas Roll--basically any of the happy hour items are great! Oh and I cant forget about the desserts, if you have any room left you have to try the cinnamon tempura ice cream, but share it because it is very filling."
4,"Thai, Vietnamese a nice patio, good happy hour and a swanky inside they have it all. Despite being a nicer place as Asian food goes the prices are quite reasonable and it is really a great value.  The happy hour menu has Asian tappas (apps) for $5 and many $5 cocktails and glasses of wine. WE had the salmon satay which was just grilled cubes of salmon on a stick with sauce and some salad, good but nothing special. The veggie wontons were great in a brown sauce and filled with veggies and again a small salad garnish. My cocktail was great but it was a bit strong. For our mains we had the Salmon with green curry, It came in a HUGE Bowl it was rich and full of great veggies and fresh not overcooked fish. $12.95 We also had the dragon noodles, which was veggies tofu and glass noodles. It was light and fresh. ~10 Over all great quality value and patio I will be back."
5,"Mojos was my favorite till I tried Menchies..much better flavors like Chocolate Covered Banana and even Pumpkin (awesome) for their seasonal!  Lots of flavor, very rich, clean & priced at about what they charge at mojos..maybe a little more but Im not sure!"
3,"Ok... So I am a sucker for a great breakfast joint that isnt some huge national chain.  Maybe its the fact that orange county seriously lacks many good breakfast joint option.  Secondly, the fact that they have dog friendly patio service elevates the place in my book. Our trips to Scottsdale arent complete until we make a stop here for breakfast.  The portions are huge!  The surprising part is that the food is good, which is not usually the case with places with places that do large portions (usually hoping that size covers up the taste). With their Mexican options such as the breakfast burrito or huevos ranchero... They knock the cover off the ball.  The green chil pork in the huevos rancheros is fantastic and keeps me coming back for it."
4,"Ive seen this place come up on Yelp a lot, especially since its near where I work, and finally had a chance to take Jon S. out for a sort of going away dinner the other night. I thought to make reservations, which was a good idea because it was very packed on a Friday night. We started with the taste of thai, which is their version of a pupu platter. My favorites were the thai toast and chicken satay. It was a little weird that the fried items were hot, but the pot stickers and siamese kisses were a little warm, but still good. I had the crispy basil chicken (level 3 hot) and Jon had the shrimp stirfry (level 1 hot). When our dishes were brought out, we both loved the flavors, but agreed we needed some more heat, and our server gladly brought out some chili paste for us which did the job.  Its a very cute restaurant and Ill definitely be back to try some other things on the menu."
4,"Back again.  Still thinking about the flatbread pizza w/ tandoori chicken. I told my friend not to order it as an appetizer b/c I felt it would be too much food intake.  One of the best things Ive eaten in a while.  I cant wait to order that as my MAIN dish next time. Soooooo good. You gotta try it! The chutney and all the flavor combinations were perfect.  It didnt sound so special on the menu, but it is!"
2,Hostess staff were a few unorganized morons-- it appeared as if it was literally their first night on the job. Maybe too many of them? The service was fast but I wouldnt say friendly. She made a few mistakes with our order-- gave my daughter a cheese pizza when we ordered pepperoni..  She put a glass right in front of my 22 mo old who grabbed it right away of course-- few other rookie mistakes like that. Calamari- gross. Lobster/crab tacos with white bland rice-- dont order it. My husband was happy with ribeye and atmosphere is cool and clean.
5,I had a facial with Jennifer and it was fantastic!  She used all proper techniques and overall it was a very relaxing and wonderful experience.  Would definitely recommend this spa for anyone living or vacationing in the area.
4,"When you specialize in something, then you should know it and do it well. This is the Zinburger approach to burgers. Our server, besides being very attentive and friendly, was also extremely knowledgeable about the preparation and ingredients. It showed me that Zinburger really knows their burgers and takes the time to educate their staff. It also served to heighten my expectations...which werent let down. The quality of my burger was very apparent. The bun was fresh, the meat was high grade, and the other ingredients were also well thought out. I love when restaurants are meticulous with their creations. This is a superb burger, expertly prepared from the creation of the patty (not too compressed) to the cooking of it (a perfectly pink in the middle ""medium"" is what I ordered and received). Simply great. The milkshakes are over-the-top rich and delicious--like eating whole pint of Haagen Dazs. We all shared one, and it was still overkill. Great tasting though. The fries were a little ""meh"" to me. Not sure why. They were hot & fresh, but a little bland. I tried the Truffle Fries as well, and they were also a little boring. Maybe they should try a different kind of oil or potato...or both. They were decent fries, just not as ""top notch"" good as the burgers. Lastly, for a ""burger joint,"" the service was excellent...to the point of fine dining type pampering. Very nice. Overall, Im a fan. Im looking forward to returning."
5,"No question -- my FAVORITE burger in the valley! I first got turned on to Lobbys at a Yelp Office Hours -- http://www.yelp.com/biz/september-office-hours-at-lobbys-tempe#hrid:kQOElzgklMRbAyWS8LhVFw - - and by my check-ins, you can see ive frequented there since.  Ive tried a lot of other ""great"" burgers -- 5 Guys, Smashburger, etc - but IMHO, none of them stack up to the food and the experience at Lobbys.  The burgers at Lobbys are so good that I crave them --I want to drive across town or plan out my day so that Im in the area to get one! I just feel that theres more quality ingredients with a Lobbys burger -- the bun, the taste, the way the cheese melts over the whole patty, the special sauce, and the burger itself.  And just as Lynn W says the service is truly superior here and "" He (Lobby) really cares about his business and it shows"".  Ive recommended many friends to check out Lobbys and have brought a few friends here -- everyone has loved it! Especially my Chicago friends that live in the valley.  Lobbys burgers is that raised bar that I measure all other burger joints to."
4,"Mosaic is a gorgeous restaurant in North Scottsdale, near Pinnacle Peak. I imagine that they have magnificent views of the desert and mountains when its still light out. The dining room is pretty small, so Id recommend reservations. If you cant get reservations, Id caution against dining in the lounge. Although they serve the full menu there, the lounge is actually in its own room and usually pretty empty, so it would detract from the whole experience. The service here is pretty close to perfect - these are professionals, the kind of staff thats trained to stop and step aside as you walk past them, even if theyre not in your way at all. The gourmet cuisine here is great - not as inventive as Binkleys, but just as well executed. The menu changes often, so I cant really recommend any particular dishes, other than the amazing Thai shrimp and coconut soup, the one dish thats always on the menu. I would not recommend ordering their foie gras, if its on the menu. It was the only dish that really missed the mark. Ive only had foie gras one other time before, at Picasso in Vegas, so I dont have that much of a basis of comparison, but the foie gras at Mosaic was way inferior to Picassos phenomenal foie gras (my understanding is that the best foie gras should be firm, smooth, a little buttery - theres here was watery and blubbery). However, that was the only ""miss"" of the night, out of our many courses. For a special occasion or a splurge night out, you wont be disappointed by Mosaics beautiful restaurant and surroundings, excellent staff, and wonderful food."
5,"This cafe provided me with my first Ethiopian cuisine experience. It was delicious and I am eager to go back. The most impressive thing to me was their selection of vegetarian dishes. They had as many options as those with meat which I really appreciate (doesnt happen very often.) The service was great. You can tell this is a family run restaurant that cares about their patrons. The food is very reasonably priced which make it easy to try a variety of dishes.  We started with the shorba which is a lentil based soup. This was probably my favorite part of the meal, it was absolutely delicious---satisfying and hearty. We also had the vegetable combination which had 5 different dishes served on the injera, a crepe-like bread you eat the main dishes with. This is a fun way to eat (with your hands) and opened up a new world of foods for us! Cant wait to go back and devour a bowl of shorba."
4,"I cant stand 50s retro but this place is the cuteness. Well...I havent technically been inside. Now, I knew this was a hipster hangout, but I wasnt expecting the cute girl in the apron or the boy with tattoos to actually be working on the other side of that window. They didnt seem to mind that I was slightly drenched in sweat having walked there under the sun of a blazing March afternoon. They were quite nice and gave my sister and I a bowl of water for our doggies. Tattoo boy said he would even make us more fries if we wanted. The fries ($2) were not the best  and neither was my grilled cheese ($4) with tomato (yum!) and pickles (?). However, the food had a nice home-made quality to it and was all ready in about a minute. Peeps are right about the high-quality ingredients and the food is inexpensive. Holler. P.S. Dont forget the Ca$hM0nayyy or to borrow from a sibling!"
4,"You my new found friend are uber popular! And, I can see why. Your restaurant is ridiculously friendly to families, girls day out and boys at the bar. I rolled in for a late day brunch with a girlfriend and was immediately seated and got to ordering right away. The menu is pretty straight forward and not real complicated.  I was in the mood for booze, really when am I not in the mood for booze, and Francis, you saint you, you delivered this fantastic gin cooler. It was excellent and I made me think I should have a pool party and serve them to all my friends, or just sit at your bar and order another! With my booze, I needed some food and I went with the eggs benedict. Hollandaise sauce is the true test of a good eggs benny. Your hollandaise is really good. Fabulous in fact. The eggs were nicely poached and I have no idea what you do with the english muffins but there was something spectular about them....All around tasty.  All and all, I can definitely see myself coming back the only draw back is the parking....more parking please!"
5,"This was such a good experience I was up all night with a extremely severe painful tooth ache I dont have health insurance so I didnt think I could afford a dentist Friends and Family told me to look up a dental school and thats how I found A.T. Still I called and they said they accept five Emergency patients a day at 1:pm It was 11am but I didnt care I drove straight there and I was the first patient seen at 1p.m. it cost $15 to be seen, $15 for the X-Rays, and turns out my wisdom tooth was infected and had a cavity so they sent me up to oral surgery, it cost me $85 to get the tooth extracted i was nervous and they talked me through it and calmed my fears It didnt hurt at all, I was numbed up and the student did a good job they gave me a three prescriptions to take with me and I have to return next week for follow - up the follow up appointment is FREE! totally recommend this place to any and everyone!"
3,I personally love the other crackers so much more. I think its the better customer service Im never really impressed with the services here. Its either okay or a little below expectation something always happens when I come here. Something is forgotten or the wait is ridiculous just for the check to be picked up to be paid for or something. I can never tell you because it always changes.  Food wise...good. this last visit the French toast was NOT as amazing as it usually is. So kind of bummed about that. And my skillet I must have ordered the wrong thing because I usually just get the skillet with carnitas eggs and potatoes this time their was chorizo in it so it made my potatoes soggy:(  those things are another reason for dropped stars and also because I dont care for Chorizo and all its oils. For food and service to be off is unusual. But it happened so i always remember if you want the best you have to go to the best and this place is not it. Go to the one in mesa behind Home depot and beside Holiday Inn!
4,"Our dinner club ended up at Maizies this month after the other pick was closed.... we lucked out! We were unknowingly there on $3 burger Monday, so pretty much everyone ordered the burger. They had told us the wait would be short, 15-20 minutes. It ended up being about 45 min, which was a little frustrating. But our waiter was awsome and fast and we received our food very quickly. I think us ravenous girls had a turnaround of about 30 minutes once seated.  First I have to give homage to their fries... Both the regular and sweet potato are excellent. Well seasoned, with potato skins, and a nice balance of crispy and soft. Their chipotle dipping sauce is reminiscent of the yummy sauce at Delux. I got a basic burger with cheddar cheese - it was cooked perfectly to order and tasted great. Total bill: $5.00 ($3 burger + $1 cheese +$1 fries= amazing deal!) My friends salad was huge and delicious looking with all kinds of good stuff on it. I want to go back and try a salad, and maybe pizza and sangria night (Tues & Wed) or, ooh, one of their stuffed burgers. I think Ill be back a few times..."
4,"Totts is this amazing little neighborhood Asian restaurant that has quickly become a favorite of mine! The simple yet effective decor is vibrant without being tacky.  The service is very friendly and helpful.  They are always smiling and it actually seems sincere! This is one of those places where you order your food from a cashier and they give you a number and you choose your seat from one of the 16 or so tables.  There is a nice little patio as well.  There are a couple of tasks you must do before they bring out your order.  1. Fill your cup with your beverege of choice (Soft drinks and Tea only- no alcohol, hence only 4 stars).  Do get a beverege as the food can be very hot if you like that way-AND I DO!  And because I am a fool thinking it will never be hot enough, I grab a jar of the hot mustard and one of the Hot Chili paste to bring to my table.  You can, of course, choose chopsticks or a fork.  I usually start with the good intentions and select the chopsticks.  I pretend I know exactly what I am doing.  But these never work as I cannot get enough food into my mouth quick enough so I end up with at least 1 fork. I am impressed how quickly they bring your order to your table.  I barely have time to do all of the above and get back to my table and they are bringing out a gorgeous plate of steaming Hot Korean with black bean sauce and tofu, or the yellow curry ""panang"" also with tofu.  You can aslo get chicken, beef or fish.  The meats are hand trimmed and do not have that grisle part that is such a turn off at other places.  The vegetable are as bright and fresh as the smiles on the employees faces. I must also confess my longing for PF Changs or Pei wei has certainly  diminished after discovering Totts. Totts even has excellent Won Ton soup. Now if they could only get a beer and wine license."
5,"Therere times when you eat something and you want more. Then there are times when you eat something and you instantly know you will never have anything quite like it. For me, I experienced both of those at Pizzeria Bianco. My buddy and I drove almost 500 miles from Santa Barbara for a Giants-Diamondbacks game and thought wed try this place I had heard about. We arrived fairly late so there was about a one hour wait but man, was it worth it. We ordered a Biancoverde and a Wiseguy. I was a bit skeptical at first because they each didnt have tomato sauce like I was used to, but I realized I dont care much for tomato sauce in the first place and Im always up for trying new things. BEST DECISION OF THE DAY. The Biancoverde was my favorite. It was so simple (3 cheeses, arugula, and olive oil) yet so amazing. It has left me wanting more to this day. The staff was nice and friendly, not to mention a few cuties. I will definitely drive 500 miles for it again. In fact, Ill be making my way to Phoenix in a few weeks, JUST for the pizza!"
3,"As far as basic burgers go this is an OK option. The flavor is ok and basic toppings give everyone enough choice. Better than McDonalds yeah and similar to In-n-Out but nothing really special. Price is not cheap for a burger so I would expect a little more, but not more fries because they give you a bucket full and more."
3,"I hate walking in here because it always stinks.  They really need to ventilate this place.  My daughter loves it, always had a great time, whether she is skating or attending Club 54.  Great place for birthday parties, she loved her party.  She also got a butt-load of tokens with the party package."
5,Bomb ..................................................................................................................... Heated toilet seats
4,"Went there for Dinner on a Friday night and I have to say Im impressed by the quality of the food and the reasonable prices.  Theres a great deal of variety and some creative New Mexican dishes.  Id go so far as to say this is the best New Mexican restaurant in the East Valley!  Its not super spicy like Los Dos but theres a lot more flavor and youll still feel the burn. Pros:  The Food and Service Cons:  Ambiance & decor could use a little jazzing up, location is not ideal"
4,"This review is for the Chandler location. The food here is pretty good. We came here twice during my last visit to AZ. We tried the nachos, the 7 layer dip, the guac and chips. The nachos were really good (make sure to add steak or chicken, both are great), and they give you a lotta guac too. The 7 layer dip was kinda dull, like they scooped out the filling of a microwaved bean and cheese burrito. Either way, all their food is pretty cheap, and during happy hour, drinks are a great deal. Also, I like the way the place is set up; most of it is outdoors/patio, so it makes for a different experience. Theres also a lot of games and things to do. We saw a group of guys playing beer pong on one of the tables, and by the womens restroom theres a lobster catching game. Wed spent like 12 bucks on that game and didnt win ourselves a lobster but we got close one time, and it was pretty damn fun."
5,"This place is absolutely amazing.  If you are looking for a quick sweet treat this is the place to go.  It a little hole-in-the-wall looking place, but once you take a bite into one of their homemade ice cream sandwiches, your mind will change.  I usually go for the mint ice cream with chocolate chip cookie, but when its fall, I cant pass up the pumpkin ice cream with snicker doodle cookie. Ive never found anything like it since."
5,"i cant review restaurants in phx and leave out LGO. breakfast, coffee ambiance, service, pizza - 5 stars. happy hour 3 stars. Not very many places beat this place out for saturday or sunday morning coffee and or breakfast after a nice wrkout, run, hike or... anything else at home in bed with your better half. must see for my visitors"
2,"So I am an occasional shopper here at this market.. for a few reasons: we love their in-house made corn tortillas; they have a good selection of mexican treats (Bimbo breads and coconut bars) and if Im buying conventional produce, their prices cant be beat.  Also, their pan Bolillo is really good and cheap and their cakes (3 Leches) are pretty damn good. OK, so here is where the minus comes in.. the BIG minus. My husband and I used to go occasionally for breakfast (Id usually order simple, straightforward things like carne asada tacos.. dont get much simpler than meat in a corn tortilla).. well, the last time we did this, I found my meat... ready?... wait for it... to be the color blue and purple.  I had brown meat, but I had pieces of it that were blue and purple... no effin joke.  I thought it was a trick of the eye, but I closely examined it and ... shonuff, that shit was blue and purple.  I immediately threw away my dish and never have I since ordered meat from their kitchen side. That being said, Ive also become more cautious in buying meats here... not to sound like a snob, but you bet Im not buying my next cut of beef here!  Im cool with their breads and their cakes and tortillas and such, but if it comes to meat, Im out the door. I much prefer Pros Ranch Market - the REAL Ranch Market."
4,"This was my first trip to Culvers and it came highly recommended. At my friends suggestion, I tried the butter burger deluxe, fried cheese curd and the.....I forgot what it was called, but the frozen custard - basically the equivalent of a DQ Blizzard. The burger patties were paper thin (thus the reason I ordered the double), the lettuce was crisp, tomatoes fresh, bun soft and buttery. I thoroughly enjoyed my burger. Very flavorful! I had never had fried cheese curd and had no idea what to expect. The closest thing I can think to compare these to would be mozzarella sticks. They are about the size of a grape, and full of salty cheesy goodness. The custard was delicious! I had the vanilla with butterscotch and oreos (I ordered butterscotch and brownie pieces, but there was a mixup, but I had no complaints). I really loved everything I had. The menu is big and I cant wait to go next time so I can try something new.  The thing I didnt like was the bible verses all over the walls. Seriously?? Its not that I am anti-religion or anything. I am Catholic, went to Brophy and go to church twice a year. I dont need it thrown in my face while trying to eat with my friends. take a tip from In and Out. Put them on the under side of your cups. Work on your subtlety Culvers."
4,"Fantabulous! Thats the best way I can describe the food here. I really wanted to get a photo of my dish, because it was a work of art, despite just being pasta et al piled onto a plate. Unfortunately, between my hunger and the amazing aroma wafting off the plate, the camera never made it out. This dish, by the way, was the strozzapreti. I could go on about how wonderful it was, but Ill spare the reader. Oh, there were also the Zucca chips. I nearly bit the waiters hand off when he tried to remove the scraps. In truth, I would love to give this place 5 stars. The food, without a doubt, warrants that rating. However, the place was pretentious to the point that it was palpable. The acoustics of the restaurant made for a very loud experience. Oh and the server was actually a bit too attentive. She was great, very nice, on top of everything... but just a little too much. Overall Id like to go again and try out some more of what they have to offer! (And of course, have more zucca chips...)"
4,"First read about this in the recent 2009 Best of Phoenix and wow, what a great choice! The place is cozy and friendly (laidback atmosphere) with food that is a wonderful culinary experience. I enjoyed the roasted garlic in olive oil with the toasted baguette slices from the start menu, though the nosh plate might need some work (more types of cured meats, and maybe some of those tiny dill pickles).  From the starter plates we had the crostini duo and the roasted grapes and brie on the multi-grain bread slices was popular with all - the one with the cucumber slices on them, a distant and less exciting second. The other starter - dates stuffed with homemade Chorizo and grueyer cheese, yum! The come on a bed of greens with some sort of vinegar dressing, which was a nice compliment. For Sharing Section of the menu - the citrus brined fried chicken and cheddar cheese waffles, loved by all! I recommend ordering it early since we asked for it about 7 pm and it was the last one left. Even the braised greens were good. I was not so impressed with the halibut filet plate  - nicely seasoned but frankly, a bit dry. Other thoughts - they really like cucumber here - they put it in the water (makes it quite refreshing), garnished my gin and tonic with it (homemade tonic, nice but not really wowed by it), and had it on the previously mentioned crostini duo plate - just seemed like a lot of cucumer. As for the service, it was good throughout the meal. The waiter kept things well paced and was a good source of information when asked, without being overly obtrusive. If you havent gone, worth checking out and if you have gone worth going back again. :-)"
2,I love the cornbread and butter but the rest can do without. The plates are so huge and super sloppy. The lettuce wraps are no good!  I did like our waitress but the bar tender with blonde hair was supper bitchy to the other staff it was annoying.
5,"my son loves the splash pad! His dad or uncles stay with him at the playground while I can run in the store or two that I need to! There are quite a few empty retail spots, hopefully they can get some new stores in there as well,"
2,"I am only reviewing it with 2 stars because my waiter was too busy and I dont think that was his fault.  We showed up and was able to sit right down which is great because when we left there was tons of people waiting.  We had a coupon for joining their mailing list that gave us a free meal with the purchase of another...which is awesome because who eats alone?  They also recently remodeled the interior and it looks pretty good.  My wife ordered the usual broccoli quiche and it was only a little warm.  I usually order the bacon and eggs which is awesome but today I ordered the Florentine Benedict and it was very good.  The food is always great here....when its warm and the service is usually awesome except today, but I wont blame Kevin since he was obviously over-sat.  I hope they get their stuff together because I WILL go back and I know that I WILL be able to write a better review afterward since I have been here 100 times and this was the only poor experience Ive ever had."
4,"freaking huge portions. the sandwiches are super yummy. the french toast, covered in bananas, and that crumbly sugary delicouisness is to die for...and you might unless you jog 10 miles afterwards. but the real treat is the desert counter...oh my god, even to just look at it is an honor. good bang for the buck."
5,"Came here on a Friday night after a bike ride. As an Irish bar, there is a lot of whiskey on the wall, but they can make whatever you need. The food was a hell of a lot better than I thought it was going to be.  On the encouragement of the bouncer, I ordered the wings which were meaty but Ive had better. What I should have gotten was the shepards pie. 2 of my friends got it, and it was VERY good. Im going to go back, just get it on my own.  Lastly, this place dishes out cheap, strong drinks. Good place to get sauced before hitting a club."
5,"went down to Scottsdale for Spring Training (Go Giants!) and we decided we wanted to have a nice, sit down meal instead of bar food or ballpark food every day/night.  Eddies House fit the bill perfectly. Food - excellent.  Tuna Tartar ""nachos"" were great.  I had the scallops and they were perfectly cooked.  Also had a size of Fiddlers Ferns which Ive only tried once before.  they were excellent.  Berry Cobbler for dessert also excellent.   Service - excellent.  very nice waiter who was very attentive. Location - close to downtown but not on the immediate Scottsdale Road path.   Atmosphere - also excellent Prices - being from San Francisco, the prices were unbelievably reasonable."
4,Julio Gs lunch menu offers some very delightful dishes.  I recommend the beef flautas special with rice and beans. The wait staff was very nice and efficient.  Good group restaurant spot!
4,"So after doing an internship in Downtown Phoenix, I was introduced to Carolinas. I was a little apprehensive at first, but I had heard many rants and raves about this hole and had to try for myself. After my first bite of Carolinas burrito, I was in love. It was awesome, and I continued to sample many of the items on Carolinas menu for the remainder of my internship, never once disappointed. I even brought home some of their famed tortillas - just those warmed with a little butter - simply melts in your mouth goodness. Awesome and cheap too!"
5,"I visited this place in January while I was in Phoenix and I miss the food! My vegan friend suggested this place to me and my other friend (we were skeptical that vegan food could taste good)...she proved us wrong! The food here was delicious, Id eat here regularly if I lived in Phoenix! When we arrived, we were worried about the hours since we got there pretty close to closing time, but they were cool! We shared the samosas and buffalo wings for appetizers. I ordered the Thai Peanut bowl with mock chicken and noodles for my entree. I felt like everything was flavored well and while I enjoy meat normally, this opened my mind to trying other vegetarian places in the future. I liked the ambiance here, great place to grab a bite with friends and chill. It was the perfect place to stop by after a busy weekend! Ill be back next time Im in the area."
4,"went for an early dinner with my honey on saturday.  we normally dont order apps but we we didnt have lunch so we needed something to get us through. we went with the hummus and pita bread and it was so fresh and yummy! server said that its homemade in house. For my entree I ordered the salmon with mixed veggies and the hubster ordered the crispy chicken and subbed the creamed corn with mashed potatoes, he loved his side of asparagus... smokey flavor.  our server did provide us a lit sample of the creamed corn because he raved how delicious it is. yes the creamed corn was very rich and in my opinion not worth the calories unless youve been good all day.  we both ordered red cabs and we skipped dessert since we were nice and full. enjoyed our meals and the friendly service."
5,"This place pushes out some delicious food, Red chile burro with rice and beans is better than any Ive had, and their Nachos are soooo freaking cheesey and good youll want to order both for one sitting. Unfortunately only outside seating but cool art work on the building to enjoy while eating and dont be discouraged by there greedy practice of charging for extra hot sauce. But of all things to remember make sure you bring cash the place cant afford a card processing machine which is a good thing other wise Id be there too often and a fat face looks weird on me"
5,"I honestly wish I could give this place 0 stars just to keep people out of here- thats how much of a gem my bf and I think this place is. The not only have a more spacious theater, a bar, food beyond the typical nachos and sour patch kids (crappy, but its there and basically just a bonus in my opinion) but they have 3 flavors of popcorn...3! Holy bajesus- we go for the Carmel popcorn alone. I dont even think we have had the regular or the cheese ever, maybe once. We go out of our way to go there just for that. This place is never that busy which I dont understand. Oh, and another plus, its not the Tweens hangout on Friday nights. I will admit, we buy the living social or grouping every time we go there ($15 for 2 tix and 1 popcorn), but they already have our business. You idiots who review a place after going to a highly publicized premier like the Hunger Games that you bought with a Groupon are just that...IDIOTS. No one wants to listen to your nitpicking, go to a useless site like Yahoo Local that no one reads so you dont have to make society dumber for listening to your complaining."
5,"I love Sapporo.  They have reasonable prices, a big menu, great music always playing, entertainment (people watching), etc... Their sushi is very good.  They have fun drinks.   If you make a reservation for dinner you usually dont have to wait. P.S.  They have amazing deals for happy hour, but get there early cause it gets packed!!"
5,Wonderful Vietnamese sandwich shoppe. Their baguettes are great hot out of the oven with butter or in one of their many sandwich choices. They have a modest selection of baked goods along with some of the best egg rolls around. Bring cash or your ATM card as no credit cards are accepted but they have an ATM on premises.
5,I love this location! The food is always great and the service is good. Wi-fi is a plus especially since I am going to school. I come here almost everyday. I recommend this location to everyone.
2,"I guess you really cant put lipstick on a pig. I will say this, its nice inside all new building and equipment, but its very much a westside gym. Many Raider hats and 0.0 eye candy. I would rather go to Moon Valley all the same new stuff but much better loking people. I will say this, its good to see people in a gym that need to be there, and it also seems very gay friendly."
4,"Im a bit of a sandwich addict. This place has the BEST tuna in town, hands down! Cheaper than Jimmy Johns, a bit more than Subway - but the fresh, locally sourced ingredients make up for it. It gets a little packed at lunch hour, so I recommend calling or faxing your order in first.  Try the #4 or #10! The potato salad is also amazing. I have not had a chance to make it in for breakfast, but I want to. A few times, I ended up going down the street to the second location because they ran out of bread (they are that good). The other location is a lot less busy and you might get hit on by one of the dudes there, but this one has Renee behind the register and she rocks (and also owns)."
5,"While I love that it is Native American owned and operated, the best thing about this restaurant is the food - as it should be.  I dont go out to eat to be entertained or charmed - just fed better than I could be at home and that is exactly what this place does.   The food is amazing. The fry bread isnt greasy and I dont know how they do that.  The meals are flavorful, filling, and reasonably priced.  The only thing I would do is add some tomatoes to the tacos but that is a minor quibble.   If you want to go out for a delicious meal in a casual place and not pay a lot for it, GO NOW to the Fry Bread House."
3,"We stopped by and rode the train, which was a good history tour. We discovered the history of gold mining in the area and some of the local lore regarding the Superstition Mountains and the Lost Dutchman Gold Mine.  I would like to come back and spend more time exploring the restored ghost town.  The train ride was a bit expensive for what it was although I enjoyed the Hurry-Up Henry the conductor."
1,"My wife and I were looking for a particular type of rose for our garden. We called this location and asked if they had it in stock and what the price was. They said they did and quoted us a price of $24.99 for a gallon sized plant. Good to go. We drive there and find the rose bush but it is listed as $44.99. So we go to the front and say that  we had called and driven 30 minutes to get this rose and we were told ""Oops...sometimes the  prices on my list up front right"". No sh!t Sherlock. So...will you honor the price quoted? NO.  So we drove down the street to A And P Nursery on Baseline west of Lindsay and got the same size plant that they were selling for $44.99 for $16.99.  Dont waste your time with these rip-off artists."
1,"Its a supermarket.  I just go in buy what I need and get out.  Its convenient that theres a wells fargo in there, but theres one across the street as well.   To the negative experience..... My sister was speaking to my niece, but not in english.  Some caucasian lady walks by and rudely says, ""Cant you speak english?""  WTF?!?  Is this taking SB 1070 in your own hands?  Its like youre trying to make every race hate you even more.  I will run into this arrogance wherever I go. Im not done yet.  Keep on reading.... My niece had a dollar in her hand and was pointing at the lottery scratcher machine.  We know you have to be of a certain age to play it.  One of the employees there rushes over and in a loud voice tells me niece she cant play it.  Calm down.  Kids are just innocent and dont need this extra verbal abuse in their lives.  Dont you have something better to do like restock the shelves?  Swear... Racial profiling."
5,Best pasta I have ever had. Dont go there if youre looking for a two-pound chicken parm or endless breadticks.
3,If only they have more fresh produce Id stop by a lot more often!
3,"Its kinda comfy setting....For the Non-(official), Yelp event, they had penne pasta...but Sonomas specialty is rotisserie chicken......Nice but I sure would have liked to taste what the place raves about---Chicken!  Oh well, the pasta was ok for what it was.  What I truly enjoyed about Sonoma was the layout.  You can easily entertain a fairly large crowd and not be on top of each other.  I need to come back and try their chicken then re-write this review. The parking upstairs for the event was nice also, but later on at night, it seems a bit spooky to be walking up in the parking area alone and in the middle of city center where there are some pretty curious characters about~~~I would prefer coming with more than one person if parking at night in the upper garage (personal preference). The Yelp folks!---Way too cool!  I am so glad to have discovered Yelp!  Best thing Ive done in ages.---Cheers Yelpers!"
4,"i used to come here with my roommate to grab an iced chai and do the crossword puzzle on our lazy, halcyon undergraduate afternoons, or come in for a warm breakfast and a cup of coffee, hungover after an amazing houseshow the night before back in the neighborhood.  this is that kind of place. great, relaxing place to do homework or study.  depending on the day and the time, youll find professors, honors college kids, hipster bike folk - the whole gamut of the non-party-bro asu population. food is good, but a little overpriced, i think.  drinks, like any independent coffeeshop, depend on the barista, but ive never had a really bad drink experience here.  i especially like the dirty chai."
5,"Im pretty sure that Palees Crown is the best Thai place I have ever been to. The service is always great, and the Owner comes out to talk to us whenever we are there. The food is so amazing, I have never tried something that I disliked at all. I especially love the Pad Thai and the Currys. I am always full and completely satisfied by the time I leave. I also recommend trying the Thai Iced Tea to drink if you are like me and enjoy weird authentic drinks, and for dessert be sure to get the coconut ice cream. Dont make excuses about trying to spend less money or that you are being careful about what youre eating, just try it. The prices are good and if youre not sure what to try, stick with a curry but remember that Asian spices are very distinct, and very spicy."
4,"We tried Mr Chaos Asian Bistro last night. Its a small place and they do a lot of take-out orders. The quirky interior works fine for me. My wife thought the single gourami looked kind of sad in the small, flat tank on the wall. They have a bar and a decent selection of wine for a small restaurant. I tried one of the specials, the Hunan Smoked Pork. It was basically kind of like bacon stir-fried with fresh vegetables with a spicy Hunan black bean sauce. I love bacon and I really liked this dish. My wife had prawns w/vegetables, we liked the freshness of the vegetables and generous amount of prawns but overall the dish was slightly bland. She liked it but thought that it would have been better with the lobster sauce. We were mixed on the iced tea, my wife felt it was too strong but I thought it was fine.  Overall, Mr Chaos is a fine choice in Ahwatukee for Americanized Chinese food. It is a bit pricier than our usual stop, Panda Garden, but a nice alternative."
1,"Great food can be found anywhere. Great service is one in a million these days. This place gets an A+ in the most awful service I have ever received and if you have/had a Groupon for this place like I did, dont even bother going. Youll be treated worse than a bothersome fly on a hot and humid day. Its simple. Businesses put  their name out by working with daily coupon sites like Groupon, LivingSocial, etc., to garner new and potential repeat customers. Instead, after going there with my handy coupon, I cant help but drive by this place on the way home and think nothing but the horrible experience I received.  I went with my boyfriend and bought the Groupon because I was impressed due to online reviews and decided to splurge on a good ole prime rib. We sit down, am impressed with the old school decor, and then the server from Azkaban appears. We tell her that wed like to order off the special evening menu where its a little cheaper and tell her joyfully that we found this place through Groupon and that its our first time. Wrong thing to do. I dont know if its because past Groupon-ers dont tip well or something, but I could swear her smile immediately turned 180 degrees in an instant.  It took our food (the chicken and prime rib) almost 33 minutes to come out. All we did was nom ... and nom ... and nom on the watery coleslaw and gritty liver (which isnt to blame since I was never a liver fan). Not once did our server come by our table. We watched her run into the kitchen and either not come back out for a while or attend to other tables. It was another server that came out and gave us our food so we let our frustration go since it wasnt her fault and theres no use in calling her out for nothing. We asked if she knew where our server was, and she said she would look for her. 10 minutes later, nothing, yet it was the new server who kept coming back, asking if everything was alright like a normal server should.  Then it was time for the check and we just wanted to get out of there since we were basically ignored. 17 minutes pass, no check came even though our  table had been cleared. Our server was still MIA so we asked a random server to give us our check. He said he would tell our server to bring it back and we told him straight up that we didnt even want to see her face so another random server brought it back. We had a table of 4 sitting next to us who even leaned over and asked us why we were being so calm when our non-existent server was treating us like crap. We didnt even want to bother waiting another 20 minutes just to talk to a manager since apparently the only way the servers here communicate is by playing Telephone so we just left after paying. The table beside us told us that they were going to complain for us since we wanted to leave, but whether they did or not I didnt even care at that point.  To be honest, I cant even remember what the food tasted like, which isnt quite fair in a review. I went here a couple of months ago, but I have never had an experience where service overrode the taste of food. Im pretty sure prisoners in a cafeteria get more attention than I did. Maybe it wasnt even the Groupon. Who knows. All I know is that we ran out of there like Usain Bolt and tell anyone who asks about our worst dining experience that this is the place to experience it."
5,"I actually visited here about 5 months ago, but I liked it so much I figured I should give it a few good words!  I was at the mall looking for something healthier than a pizza or burger and decided upon this place. It is part of their little slogan after all! I was not disappointed. I chose the beef kabob with a side of fries and pita bread with a cup of hummus. Everything was positively fresh and absolutely delicious. And the portions were big, too. I didnt think I would be filled up after the meal, but I was stuffed! The staff was very friendly and cooked everything in a timely manner. I was surprised they werent getting nearly as much business as the other joints around the food court. They dont know what theyre missing!"
5,"If I could only eat at one place for the rest of my life, it would have to be at FnB. This is ultimate comfort food for me - with the bulk of the menu highlighting local in-season organic vegetables from McClendon and other local farms. Charleen prepares dishes that pay the ultimate homage to the vegetable and the farmer with perfect seasoning, contrast, balance and temperatures.  Beyond vegetables, the housemade burrata was light as a cloud and shrimp grilled to perfection on the mesquite. Dishes at FnB are simple but often the simplest dishes are the hardest to get right as there is nothing to hide behind - ingredients have to be fresh and of the highest quality and execution must be perfect. Charleen and her crew strike it out of the park almost every time. Service is professional, attentive and friendly. Pavle and his team make you feel right at home, which is the other reason why I would happily eat here everyday."
5,"Great time, great location, ability to park in garage behind it. Beautiful decor, candles, white furnishings, trimmed in wood. Excellent vodka choices that will have you dancing on that raised table all nite which gives you a cool panoramic view of the place. See if you can spot the dj booth! Hes cool, friendly door staff. The bartenders kind of ignore you and theres a brunette girl bartender-stay away from her. Downer attitude, and she will charge you for 2 drinks even though they have a 2 for 1 special. But its a cool club and its 99% certain youll have great time."
4,"Step back into the 1990s and enjoy a workout! Nice clean facility. Equipment sort of jammed in at odd angles (in the large weight/cardio room) but its good stuff. Not sure the purpose of two weight rooms. I think the club is more tennis based yet they have do have group exercise classes, racquetball courts and a pool.  I think the spinning room may have been a childrens nursery at one time based on the wall graphics, the black light effect is unique. If this were my club Id place the emphasis on spinning classes and convert the smaller weight room into a spinning studio.  Dropped a star because the womens locker room doesnt have a sauna.  Very friendly employees! I am so glad to be greeted with a smile when walking in the door. Everyone on the staff is friendly. Quaint club. . . in a good way."
5,"...NOW WERE TALKIN! Killer Mexican Food! The chips n salsa kicks ass! You get a red, blue & regular tortilla chips with reg, spicy salsa & bean dip! Hellava start! A kick-butt margarita! Had Chicken Fajitas!...THE BEST! Cannot wait to return! Great ambiance."
4,"So I came here in search for Phoenixs best Macaroni and Cheese. Yep, thats right, me and the inner kid in me are in search of the best Macaroni and Cheese.  So, ordering was simple! So, how was it? Pretty good! It was more cheddary than, say, Becketts Table (which got me started on this dance). The atmosphere was pretty cool there. However our wonderfully bubbly waitress probably came over way too much. Also, nobody coming over to refill our drinks (iced tea) could figure out that we had tea and not water. Oh well. On a separate note, Ive gone by this place around 2AM it looks like a madhouse. Could be a rather interesting time around 2AM!"
3,"I live in downtown Phoenix; Boyfriend lives in Tempe. After two years of getting our date on at places like Postinos, St. Francis, the Rokerij, Dicks Hideaway, and Padres, we decided we needed a Tempe date place. Friday night we decided to check out La Bocca. In short. its okay. Nice environment, good service, pretty good pizza, and great ice cream flight for dessert. But this is tempered with over priced wine (almost $20 for two glasses of HOUSE wine?), small pieces of bruschetta (tasty - scratch that - REALLY tasty, but the slices are teeny tiny), and its on Mill, so most of the other patrons are frat guys trying to impress sorority sisters, and if youre lucky, youll get to see a couple of Greeks making out. Yum? There was a table of older people tucked into a corner who didnt seem to mind the age gap, but in my late-20s, I was not very much amused. The good service, cool atmosphere, tasty bruschetta choices, and creative, thin crust pizza get this place three stars. The over priced wine and bruschetta (seriously, we usually get bruschetta at Postinos for the same price for 4 people, and then I am too full to order dinner, but at La Bocca I was ready for round two after my half of the plate), and the fact that its on Mill keeps it from 5 stars. We both really wanted to like this place, but I think next time we want to get dressed up and go out on the East side, well try somewhere else. In the meantime, well stick to downtown."
4,"This place is busy, had live music in the bar, and the servers were trying to squeeze by.  The seafood is flown in DAILY and I think our bill helped fund a grouper or twos first class seat.  I ordered the grouper with crab on top (as an extra- you can ask for it this way).  Ordered the lobster mashed again, and green beans (if it aint broke- dont order something else.).  Had a great night!"
4,"Weve eaten at Taneko twice now, and while we like it, its awful expensive for what you get, and I prefer a more authentic Japanese environment. Taneko starts off wanting to be a Japanese-style pub restaurant, but ends up throwing way too much Scottsdale into it creating a rather pretentious yet still yummy restaurant. The food is excellent - I enjoy the pork meal that has the stupidly spicy mustard sauce.  My kid likes the fried rice, though it is a little too much on the ginger side.  Theres a gimmicky hot-rock appetizer where you cook pieces of steak on a super hot rock.  Its way too expensive for what little meat you get, but its an awful lot of fun. The service is excellent as well, though maybe a little too servile for my tastes.  The wait staff go WAY out of their way to make you comfortable and quickly take care of any needs.  I just dont care for all of the introductions - Im not going to remember the names of the 4 or 5 people bringing me stuff.  Still, I think thats the Scottsdale influence.  Not bad, but not really my thing. Overall, Ive enjoyed both of the meals that I ate at Taneko, but with better places to eat real Japanese food like Yasu, Sea Saw, Hiros and even Sakana, Im probably not going back real soon."
5,"I have taken acting classes from Verve Studios on and off for four years, and have recently returned for another work out! Amanda is a true professional,  a working Actor herself,and gets the actor to be real, not ""act"".  Do not miss this opportunity to learn and grow, AND have fun. Lawannah Curry Phoenix Az"
5,"They finally just opened a Ritas location in Surprise!! I think it just opened yesterday or today, but its just as good as the one on Union Hills and 83rd Avenue.  I told my co-workers about it and we basically have been driving by during our lunch break just waiting for it to open over the past few months. Its hard to explain the texture of the ice. Its thicker than the ice in a frozen margarita, yet its not crunchy or unrefined like an Icee drink. Sonic has similar ice, but I feel like its just not as good as Ritas. I guess thats why its Italian ice. Its in its own category! There are 3 main types: Gelatis (custard-ice-custard), Blendinis (custard-ice-custard with mix ins like Oreos, M&Ms, etc), and Mistos (ice-custard drink). You can also get just regular custard alone or flavored ice alone. One of their most famous ice flavors is Swedish Fish. Theres also a sugar substitute version of their ice and todays sugar free ice flavor was Pineapple. I tried a Red Velvet Cake Gelati today with vanilla custard and it was nothing less than amazing! The menu is a little confusing since there are so many choices. There are mainly only 2 types of custards though, vanilla and chocolate, that can be mixed with the 12 flavors of ice that consistently change.  Before, I was solely a fan of ice cream and yogurt. Now, I am grateful that my sister-in-law dragged me here, because there is nothing quite like it yet! Now I will always compare Italian ices to this place."
4,"We had a very difficult time finding trail 201 which was noted as one of the more strenuous hikes. We took trail 100 and came across some extreme mountain bikers, several other hikers and a couple who gave us confusing directions on how to reach one of the highest sections of the mountain. We got lost and ended trail busting which is highly discouraged but give us rules and we will break  em. During our run back down the trail I took a pretty hard fall face planting into the dirt, stabbing my right hand into a rock and banging up my knee. No broken bones or teeth, thankfully. We had just passed a couple of hikers when I took the fall so they saw everything. I laid there for about 10 seconds, jumped back up, noticed the blood, my torn tee and just continued on with the hike. We came across a park ranger who was standing outside his truck and asked if he had any medical supplies. Unfortunately, his first aid kit was about 20 years old and didnt contain anything that would help any of my wounds. We found a CVS on our way home and picked up some medical supplies and my wounds were washed and bandaged in the parking lot.  Probably my most memorable hike thus far."
3,"The venue, which is close to campus, usually gets all the big shows from Hot Hot Heat to Incubus to Mickey Avalon to Brand New. The great thing about the venue is that you can stand almost anywhere and still be able to see the band. Theres a big bar inside with friendly bartenders, although the well drinks can be a little pricey. Theres usually a hot dog vendor outside and most of the bands performing can be found walking around before and/or after their sets, making it easy to mingle. The downside about the Marquee is that parking sucks. Theres not a ton of parking in the clubs lot and the nearby lots usually fill up fast so be prepared to trek down Mill to get to and from your car if you dont arrive early."
3,"its an Imax theater, so unless you havent been to one then it you know it is an oversized screen with wider shots and better sound. The location itself looks dated and in need of some repair, perhaps just some paint. The viewing experience was great and I will go back if there is another flick being shown that I must see in IMAX, but the fact remains the Mall, the Theater and much of the area looks dated."
1,"Bad quality ingredients. I ordered a red curry beef and the beef was awful, hard, I tried to chew it for a minute and decided to give up."
4,"Finally Biltmore gets a sushi place after the departure of Ayako! Well if you have been to Stingray in Old Town Scottsdale, this is same menu, etc. But I happened to like the atmosphere at this location better! Came here for a happy hour, had a drink called the Tokyo Tease(delish!) and since I love sashimi sushi (which isn`t on the happy hour menu, no big deal), ordered my sashimi combo, which didn`t disappoint!! Included tuna, salmon and yellowtail. Did enjoy the bevy of assorted rolls that went by. I like the outside/inside seating bar- great on beautiful weather days! I will be back for more!!"
1,"If only I where rating this place based on their sushi I would give it 5 stars.  But, Im not  rating it based on the food.  It is purely based on the customer service in this establishment.  Be warned; if you have a large party this is NOT the place to go.  Ive been in the restaurant industry for over 20 years and I have NEVER heard of a restaurant not splitting checks for large parties.  So for an over 500.00 bill they will take 15+ different forms of payment but wont split up the check by individuals or couples.  How does this make any sense.  To make matters worse; they bring out the sushi and I quote ""family style"".  Since when did sushi get served family style?  Here is the problem.  Sushi is expensive, not everyone at the table ate it and when served ""family style"" someone else may get what you ordered and you wont have a clue it even made it to the table.  We spent over 40 minutes trying to figure out this bill, SERIOUSLY!  When I asked the manager her generic and obviously well rehearsed response was ""this is our company policy, we do not split checks for large parties"".  This is absurd.  So not only did we have a heck of a time figuring out the bill, Im pretty sure no one really knew who had what and if they had added random things to the bill.  How could you know with that many people ordering????  I never received part of what I ordered yet it made it on that bill.  So here we have to pay it regardless of what we may or may not have received?  I understand that adding gratuity to a party this size is also common practice which I dont normally have a problem with but how about some EXCELLENT customer service in return.  If policy is no separate checks, at least tell everyone as they order or as a group that this will occur.  They said someone was told when the reservation was made.  The reservation was made for 25 people!  It wouldve taken 2 seconds to again relay this important piece of information.  Worst experience ever!"
3,"I came here with a friend for a Groupon dinner.  We got an appetizer assortment , an entree each, and a house margarita.  The app plate came with mini chimichangs (yay), chicken taquitos (yay), cheese quesadilla (nay), and wings (ok).  I had a decent chicken fajita, and my friend loved her steak fajitas.  The drinks were a little too strong in my opinion.  Overall, I would need another try at this place without the Groupon deal, and see if they can execute more flavorful food."
5,"Good choice of ingredients, a bit out of a student budget, but it was WORTHY all the way. I was drooling with the flavors! Good environment and good service and good music (bistro style). Im not much of a pizza eater, but this has a good place in my list! Forget about your papa dough or cheap Sunday pizzas...this is a real one!"
4,Love this place. Quaint.  Nice owners.  The meatloaf is fantastic.  Reminds me a little of home in Mn.  .. . old house.
4,"Tried this place for the first time and had the chicken pho and and mongolian beef with red rice. All was delicious...but I especially loved their red rice, it was spicy and soooo good. Everything is very reasonably priced and you can even get it delivered from a service called You Buy and We Fly!!"
5,ouchh...my fuckin head is pounding this morning.  thanks a lot guys!
4,Good Date Night Spot!!!  Went here the other night for dinner and it was really good. I had the steak and my wife had the casa dilla of the day.  Both were cooked to perfection.  Sometimes nicer places have really small portions and seem to pay more attention to how pretty the dish is instead of how good it is but this place was spot on with both presentation and taste. We did not have a reservation so we sat at the bar which has full menu service.  The bar wraps around and near the mens restroom there is some additional bar seats that nobody sits at.  I thought this area might have been a little more private than some of the two person tables.  I also thought it was cool to be able to see into the kitchen but that might only be appealing to me.  The bartender was very knowledgeable and checked on us several times during our meal.  This place has a good vibe for couples doing the date night thing but there was also a table of 6 near us who were also having a good time.  Cowboy Ciao is a win win.  The desert donuts are ridiculously good as well.
5,"Love Love LOVE Bakers Nursery!!  Been going there since I was a child thanks to my grandparents (my grandad and uncle used to do roofing work for the owners decades ago).  Seriously...this place is FANTASTIC and the people who work there are AWESOME!   Want to know what plants/trees you have in your yard?  Bring in a leaf or bark sample and theyll tell you.  Found out we have Chinaberry trees(messy!), Lantana (evil and will not die!), 2 Trumpet vines (attracts hummingbirds!) and a Texas Sage bush (beautiful purple flowering bush) in our yard.  Want to know what type of tree would do well in your yard?  Just ask!   Need something transplanted?  Buy the pots and theyll replant your plants for you.   Buy a sad looking clearance plant from another local store, theyll tell you how to nurse it back to health.   I could easily wander around Bakers for hours, except during the heat of the day in the summertime!  :)"
1,This place is disgusting!!  The bun was dry and stale.  The veggie burger was yucky... I dont think I have ever had one I didnt like before.  The kids meals are miniscule.  The topping bar is so simple and plain.  The dips are not very good... cheese dip is YUCK!  Drink choices stink.  Cookies taste raw and boring.  Almost forgot to add that the two young kids didnt even care for the french fries because they are seasoned.  I thought they were a total waste of calories.  I cant believe the prices either... so not cheap or even worth what you pay for.
5,"I now have a sixth Sens for delicious Asian tapas- a genre I never knew existed. I always assumed the best tapas disappeared when Aaron May sauteed Sol Y Sombras last batch of butter-marinated brussels sprouts! Well, I was proven wrong when I hit up the ultra-cool Sens Asian Tapas & Sake on a Thursday night.  Guests are greeted by electric blue lights, neon pink lotus blossom light fixtures and fresh beats courtesy of a hipster DJ, which transport the hungry to an intoxicating, fluorescent experiens filled with sauces, sakes, and spicy flavors they probably dont even know about yet.  I tried three top-notch items: Wasabi Tofu- Hot, in every Sens of the word. Wasabi and 300-degree tempura crusties have the ability to burn you to your soul if you arent careful. Dont skip it, just poke it with a chopstick or blow on it first.  White Peach Juice and Vodka- Just like Japanese candy exchange students brought home in high school, its one of those miraculous flavors most Americans will never have the opportunity to try. Light and sweet, but not overly so, its a perfect blend you can sip all.night.long. (I did!) The best, by far, is the Hot & Sour Soup. Its nothing like the kind you get for .99 at Chinese restaurants as an appetizer. A Bilbo Baggins-ey cauldron arrives with a wooden ladle- among the various veggies and disc-shaped noodles is your choice of meat- I chose clams. Ive always heard you can truly tell how talented a chef is by how tasty his soup is, and would have to agree. Theres nothing to hide behind, and youre confronted by pure flavor. It was complex, different and mouthwatering. The whole Sens-ation was so genius, I even got past the embarrassment of Chef Johnny Chu snorting in my face for taking pics of my meal on my iPhone."
2,"I used to be a huge fan of this place, but it was just ok this time around.. A bunch of us went and I ordered their steak for two.. 22oz. Thought it might be good.  It was dry and had no flavor.  She had asked at the beginning ""Do you guys want A-1?""  I said ""No thanks.""  A good steak shouldnt need any sauce.  I should have asked for a ton of it.. just ugg.. We also got their artichoke, which was actually not too bad.  I love the one they do at Cheesecake  Factory. if you combine both, you have the ultimate smoked artichoke.   Everyone was ok with their meal and one of my friends loved his.  He got the chicken fried steak.  Cant really mess that up I guess.  it was pretty good.  Id go back, but Im not the fan i used to be of this place."
1,"I have have been going to Bosa off and on since they opened. Have a bad experience and stop for a while. Then I tell myself "" Its right down the street why not "" then disappointment again.  1. Went in on a Fri at 630AM for their special curler donuts, that they ONLY do on Fri. Sure enough nothing was prepared. Was informed it would take another 30 min to finish the donuts. Noticeable very, very, very irritated I ordered 2 other donuts instead. Was planning on a dozen, but had to settle for what they had. Well staff made sure to charge me a credit card fee due to my purchase being under $ 5.00. When you dont have what you advertise, you might want to waive the .50 fee. Or you will really piss off that customer. Common sense. 2. Customer service is horrible. See #1. 3. When I get home I have never received the correct dozen donuts I ordered. I dont understand it ???? Im perplexed ??? I dont think its anything personal. I just never get the correct dozen. They close the box, I pay and go home. Surprise. The donuts are OK nothing great and not bad they are donuts. They are convenient and close, but I must remember to pass on Bosa Donuts."
4,"The husband and I had driven by Hulas multiple times, saying it looked interesting but we were always on our way to another destination. We finally stopped in on their 3rd Anniversary and boy, are we glad we did. The wait for a table was probably 45 minutes, but the place was packed and in all consideration, it wasnt as long as other places weve been. Plus, we wanted to sit outside, since a band was going to be playing. (Who were awesome, btw.) Drinks were $3 all night, special anniversary prices, and we tried the Dr. Funk and the Painkiller. The Dr. Funk was delicious! The Painkiller is similar, but had cinnamon or another spice in it that I didnt care for.  I ordered the coconut shrimp egg rolls to get us started and they were fantastic! For dinner, I had the coconut encrusted butterfish and the husband had a pork plate. (Mine was delicious but the pork was just okay.) Our friends had steak tacos and a salad. The steak tacos looked so good, we had to come back a second time. The second time here, I had the steak tacos and the husband had the steak dinner. Mmmm, the steak tacos were totally worth it. (We also ordered the coconut shrimp rolls again - definitely a favorite.) For dessert, we got the brownie with macadamia nut ice cream. The brownie wasnt anything special but the ice cream was good. When we checked in on Yelp, we received $5 off our bill. This was a nice surprise! Totally check this place out - well definitely be back!"
5,"So, my friend and I went first to Yasu because we heard it was great. We were traveling on business and therefore using company plastic. So, we show up and the kid working the door says in a very ""Spicolli-like"" voice, ""uh.... our credit card machine is broken tonight""..... So we replied that we were on expense accounts and would there be any way they could manually run our credit cards... The guy replies, ""dude, youre outta luck"".... Funny, considering that I am a guy who eats out a lot and am not afraid to spend a lot of money in a place when the food and service is good... I wont be going back in there... So we made our way to Hiro..... We were pissed and hungry after driving around and dealing with idiots all over town. Hiro was just what the doctor ordered. We sat down and were greeted and served drinks right away. We put our sushi order entirely in the hands of our chef who did not disappoint. He brought out order after order of fresh delicious sushi and sashimi... We had beer, sake and a great night.... When it was said and done, we spent about $250 for the two of us which was a lot but well worth it..... Im sure you could go and have a great meal for much less, but we were going big and NOT PAYING!!!!!  Morale of the story is that Yasus children working that night ran us out and straight to their competition where we will be spending money in the future... Go check out Hiro!"
1,"I understand Im not dude and so Im not there to state at your ""twin peaks"" however, that being said I am there to buy a beer and when it takes the bartender 20 minutes just to get a beer Im over it. So I was never gonna come back but was forced with a group of friends who wanted to eat and was just as upset as the first time. Fries were soggy and our server disappeared. We all decided were not going back. Just because your a good looking server doesnt give you an excuse for sucking."
5,"I moved to AZ about five months ago and have had two tragically bad haircuts from two other ""salons.""  I wear my hair in a short pixie cut and its very hard to find someone with the skills to do it right so I dont  end up with a mans cut. I found Epic Salon here on Yelp and decided to give it a try. I could not be more pleased.  My appointment yesterday was with Chey and shes wonderful.  I am very exacting when it comes to how I like my hair cut and am fluent in industry terms so I can articulate what I want. Chey listened very well and understood what I wanted. She totally delivered.  I am so very relieved to have found her.  And at $26 (cut only, no blow out) its a real deal."
3,"Meh. As my fellow Yelper said to me a few days after we ate here: ""No Brio review, Im shocked!""  I didnt jump on writing this review because I was pretty underwhelmed by the experience. The ambience sucks, the service wasnt very good and the food was totally average.  My cursor is blinking at me and I still dont know what else to say about my time spent here.  Ambience- looks like an Italian cheesecake factory. Why are the collumns so huge?! Service- the bartender kept interrupting us to take our order when we STILL werent ready. Jeez, does it look like Ive moved my menu in the 53 seconds its been since the last time you checked? And then disappeared when we were finally ready.  Food-  -carpaccio, not bad but does it seriously need to be that huge? The two of us didnt even come close to finishing it.  -Mediterranean pasta, pretty much the only one without a cream sauce on the whole menu. They split it for us which was nice and it tasted all right with mushrooms and chicken and stuff.  -tiramisu came out frozen. They were super apologetic and didnt charge us for the replacement, but it was still awkward. They obviously just heated up a piece which made it melty and just not that great. So yeah, thats that."
4,"They have plenty of equipment so there should never be a wait for anything. They offer great classes, although they tend to get too full sometimes. It would be nice if there was a restroom up front so you dont have to walk through the entire shower/locker room if all you need to do is pee!"
4,Ive been for lunch half a dozen times and usually sit at the bar.  Their beers are great.  Im a home brewer and am pretty discerning in my beer tastes.  Their HopKnot IPA has a huge nose of hops if you are a hop lover--which I am.  However the 8th Street Pale is probably my favorite.  It is a great balanced English style pale ale--without the bitter edge of an American pale ale like SN.  On a hot day their Kolsch is super refreshing and reminds me of being in Germany.  Ive had mostly burgers and fries there and they are good.  The atmosphere is casual and the staff is friendly and attentive.  If you are a craft beer lover it is a nice laid back destination to enjoy a brew...or two.  They also pour growlers and sell cans of Kolsch and Kiltlifter in 12 packs.
2,TORTILLA SOUP = not the biz. thats all I tasted so thats all Im rating this place on lol
1,"Worst store in the chain - I agree with one poster that its not crowded but it also is out of items more than any other store.  It also is so understaffed its impossible to get help if you need it and if you ask someone that works here that you finally locate, my experience is that they wont know what your asking for anyway.  I recently was in the store asking about a certain item by Susan Lenart Kazmer, the person looked right at me and said oh we dont carry that artist you might try hobby lobby they get a little credit for trying to help but Susans line is a Michaels only item.  I gave the woman the line name and said no we dont carry that Im sure.  I pointed at the huge display in front of me of Susan items and her answer, Oh that must be brand new.  I said nope it came out three years ago now can you see if you have this specific item she said oh we cant do that and she walked off talking to her friend the only other employee in the store that i had seen.   Ok bad but any store can have a bad employee right.  so I go up to pay, a pleasant young girl asks me if I have a Michaels card?  I say sure do and hand it to her.  Oh thats not a Michaels card ours are red.  I explain that its a gold card for people who spend more money and that as a professional artist Im there quite a bit.  She says Ive never heard of that before.  Well its a Michaels card just read the front it says Michaels right there.  she stands looking at me so I said try scanning it I promise it will work.  She scans it and then says oh it says you have a $5  off coupon loaded on this card.  My response;  good you get a five dollar coupon for every 100 you spend.  Now she looks scared and says the dreaded words Im not sure,  let me call the manager.  So 20 minutes go by and who shows up the lady that argued about the Susan Lenart items.  They finally agree to try it and Im finally out the door just 40 minutes later.  And thats not even the bad part!   I went into this store to have something framed that was three weeks ago they tell me every day it will be the next day all to no avail they use every excuse imaginable custom frames take time, or custom mat colors are hard to get.   Each time I explain its a off the shelf frame there only cutting a black mat.  they say oh that should be fast will have it tomorrow.   I wouldnt shop here again if it was all free this store is a joke just keep driving and go to the large store at Power and McKellips its a much larger store with competent staff and about twice the selection.   Its well worth the drive and the cost of gas I live less than two miles from the gateway store and can still drive make my purchases and drive home much faster than trying to shop at the local gateway store.  They have even  framed two other items while Im still waiting for the Gateway store to cut a simple mat."
3,"Moira isnt the best sushi Ive ever had, but for Phoenix and my neighborhood and the pricepoint (as long as we dont order alcoholic beverages) is doable when we get a sushi craving.  The happy hour is a great benefit if you can get away from work before it ends.   Their spicy rolls are definitely spicy, and have some great kick to them. It hits the spot without breaking the bank and well take it."
4,"After paying $10 for a footlong Tuna and a drink at Subway (read the review), I was obligated to find new lunchtime stomping grounds. And Ive found one.  How someone is going to take points for ""ambiance"" in a Chicago style gyro eatery is worth my lolz. But, youre not going to a Chicgo style gyro eatery for ""ambiance"". Youre going for good grub, and a bottomless drink cup. This place rocks for what it is.  The decor is cool. I spent the vast majority of my meal staring at the posterboard sized photos of downtown Chicaga. I was lost and mezmerized at the fine details of the photos. I would bite, and stare. Bite, and stare.  And there was much to bite on. This pita came STUFFED with succulent, tasty meat. Im not a tomato fan, so I left those for those who are. My gyro was oozing sauce. I would take a bite, and while enjoying the deliciousness that permeated my over-stuffed mouth, contemplated what to do about the sauce on my fingers. KNOWING that if I dared to open my mouth, Id be looking at the food I had just started to chew, but understanding that if I did nothing with the sauce it would drip off of my fingers into the basket. Quite the dilemma, I tell you. Bite, and stare.... Ooooh! Look! Fries! Mmmmmmm....  I was there at 11:30 on a Thursday, and it was less than crowded. Parking was no issue.  All of this for less than $7. Yep. Ill take my $3, and give it to the bum on the street. Better than spent at Subway."
2,"No credit, weird layout,  not much fresh food"
1,"I have received two pedicures and a manicure from this location.  I usually prefer a more spa like experience but the cost is low and I was attempting to save a few dollars.  Cutting cost may not be a good thing to do when it comes to body care.  I wont be returning because I am concerned about health violations. Pros: Quick service Cheaper than the spa, salon Cons: Improper cleaning of foot baths.  I thought they were good until I saw them seat a women at a used station.  They only took the sprayer and rinsed the dirty bowl.  (I did let her know) The foot massage was more like a foot beating.  About an hour later my ankles felt like I had rolled them.  It took almost two weeks for them to feel normal again. The sent in the shop is of fake nails.  If everyone has on a mask, I would like one to."
3,"Im no regular here, but on occasion I get a craving for an Iced Mocha that tastes like chocolate milk. Tullys has that down. Thats the only thing Ive ever ordered here (I go elsewhere for my usual espresso needs), so I cant speak on the rest of their drinks. But, I dont imagine the rest of their drinks being bad; their Iced Mochas are very enjoyable. The service can be spotty. There are a couple ladies that work there that are sweet and take good care of the customers. But Ive also encountered a couple of employees that arent friendly and/or are super slow. Whatever; Tullys isnt my usual haunt. But its good for what it is: fast-food-coffee."
3,"I only did layovers in this airport to and from Colorado from California, but I liked it. There were a ton of places to eat which was fantastic. Their flights left on time, which was kinda annoying when we got in 10 minutes late and ended up getting stuck there for almost 3 hours. Free internet access helped with that though. Its an airport I dont mind being stuck in for a bit."
4,"I went here with my husband last Sunday afternoon.  We had a 2 for 1 coupon out of the Entertainment guide.  We are from San Diego and have been trying to find Mexican food places similar to the food out in San Diego.  We pulled up to the location and were debating if we should go in or not.  The area wasnt the best, and it was in a tiny strip mall.  Kind of looked like a taco shop.  We decide to go in, because we were starving.  Inside it looked completely different.  It was a little dark and dated.  But the atmosphere was very causal and the hosts were super nice.  We sat down and right away got some nice warm chips, salsa and beans served to us.  I was feeling like a margarita and was going to get the house one, when the waitress said they had 99 cent margaritas available.  We ordered our food and didnt have to wait very long to get it.  Super good food and really cheap 99 cent margaritas. The margaritas were served in pretty nice size glasses but a bit strong.  FYI, I think youre getting really cheap alcohol in there, seemed pretty stiff. I started buzzing after my second glass.   My husband even loved the Chile reino that he tried from my plate.  He usually doesnt like it at all.  The carne asada was seasoned very well, it was a great change from some of the bland Mexican food Ive had out here in phoenix. My husband had the beef chimichanga and it was seasoned really well also.  For the price you cant beat it.  From the outside the restaurant seems a little ghetto looking, but once you get inside its pretty nice in there.  I would defiantly try it again."
2,"Oh god.. I use to love this place its the closest store to me, and I have my safeway card so Im good to go.. place is a mess.  First the parking lot.. too small for the amount of things going on at this complex, I am shocked that there isnt a daily accident in the parking lot. People are impatient, driving down the middle of the rows instead of one sides.. I just got back from there and I was making my exit and three cars tried to go for my parking spot created a jumble mess, so much so I had to pull back in the spot so they could move.. ugh.  Inside the story, they seem to always always be stocking and never seem to be stocked.. When I go I can never fully complete my shopping list, there is always something not stocked so I have to come back or just go with out it.. But today took the cake.. Its just after one in the afternoon, every single row there was at least one person stock, blocking half of the row.. its 1pm! Usually by 1, stores are stocked up, maybe one or two things to go..  There was also a cockroach.. and not to sound snobby but the type of people that tend to go to this on, I feel I need to carry mace or have a buddy..  So I may go back for quick in and out shopping, but for big shopping trips Ill drive out of my to somewhere else.. even with the gas prices.."
4,"If only they had a place like Tryst Cafe back in California! The first and only problem I had with the place was the fact that I wanted nearly everything on the menu. They have amazing specials, and while the Monte Cristo breakfast sandwich and glazed-walnut French toast looked amazing, I was hungry and opted for the Hawaiian breakfast. The food came pretty quickly and was warm. We didnt order any drinks because the fresh-squeezed ones are so expensive its actually cheaper to buy one of their smoothies. The hawaain special- composed of 2 fried eggs, shredded Kalua Pork, cabbage and rice- was tasty, but a little bland. They gave my brother and I (we ordered the same thing) some soy sauce, but I would have preferred a nice dollop of ketchup instead of the sodium infested kikkoman. Other than that, the dish was delicious. They fried the eggs perfectly, the runny yolk making the rice and pork taste even better! I usually only like my eggs over-hard, so it was a pleasant surprise. My mom opted for the healthy option, getting the yogurt parfait. In my opinion, this was the disappointment of the table. My mom claimed that she loved it and that it tasted like Beijings yogurt. My mom must have some really refined tastebuds because all I tastes was some store bought low-fat vanilla. The granola was good and the berries fresh and few. What can you expect for $5? In my opinion, a little better than that. My dad, opting for the unhealthy option got the huevos rancheros. He ate it so quickly I didnt get a taste, so I can only assume it was tasty. Overall? Great choices, great venue, and good food."
4,"A Mexican friend  of ours recommended Arribas. We usually order take out, the 2 times I ate at the restaurant, service was poor and food was not as good.  Luckily, every time we order for take out the food has been very good. The chips and salsa are always fresh. My husband likes the chicken chimi platter and we had try the carne adobada pizza, plate and sampler platter. I like the way they seasoned the food, not too salty and you can taste the spices. Leftovers taste better (though maybe mushy) the next day. So, service and food at the restaurant will be a 2, but since I always have a great take out experience, Ill give them 4 stars"
5,"Wow, that is some great BBQ.  Probably the best I have had in Arizona.  The pork was great as were the BBQ beans.  I will be there again and again!"
2,"I had high hopes for the Habit since I live only a couple miles away, but it was mostly disappointing for me.  Im vegetarian, so I have no idea how their meat burgers taste, and they may be the best in the world for all I know, but the veggie burger was a tasteless lump for the most part.  I do give them kudos for having a veggie burger, but either put more effort into it, or take it off the menu and go full-on meat! The service was nice, and I like the design of the place, but there are too many good veggie burgers to be had in the Valley to waste my time eating this one.  Parking lot is super-cramped, so if you need your meatburger fix, then dont come right at 12 or 6, unless you want to park in someones yard."
5,"I have been saving my 100th review for my favorite restaurant of all time.  We found Thai Basil over a year ago now and have been loyal customers, going at least once a week and sometimes more than that, since last July. Everyone who works here is super friendly, and they know us now and know what we like to order by heart. We just walk in now and they see us and say ""Spicy noodle, tofu, hot, right?"" Its pretty great having a place that knows my regular order. I have tried most of the menu items. The garlic eggplant is also pretty great. The thai basil is also amazing. I have generally liked everything I have had here except the curry. I never have had a good curry experience. Both of the times I ordered it I ended up with long black hairs in it (which they quickly replaced with a new order) but I just wasnt a fan. Maybe its because of the coconut milk and it makes it too sweet.  The spring rolls are also the best here out of every spring roll I have had anywhere.  Before I went vegan again last year we also got the fried banana ice cream pretty often. That is pretty amazing. If you eat dairy, you have to try it at least once.  Thai Basil is one of our regular spots to eat out, and we hope its here to stay for many more years to come. I dont know what I would do without my spicy noodles!!!"
4,"I came here with a friend who has been here many times and recommended it.  I wasnt disappointed.  First, we came during the lunch rush and it was busy.  However, we were still seated immediately and served by a friendly waitress quickly.  The food then came out in about 5 minutes!  I had the rib tip plate, and it was very good.  My friend had the pulled pork sandwich which was also good.  Its out off the beaten path but worth the trip.  When you pull into a place out in a strange location, and its packed?  Good sign."
3,Great service. Good food. Had baked scallops. Reasonable prices
3,"If I were to have written this review 2 years ago, it would have been 5 stars, but the portions keep on shrinking at an alarming rate. Today I had the meat plate and no more than 2 tablespoons of pulled pork, and brisket were on the plate. Also, whats with the staff? They are like robot drones! Absolutely no personality! The foods flavor, and quality, however, are very good, the place is always sqeaky clean.. and of course the decor is very amusing. Being a hungry hungry hippo, I would prefer a slight price increase, to maintain portion size."
5,Absolutely sensational food.  We had the evening buffett. I will be driving 40min one way to eat here again.  Wow I just really enjoyed my meal.
5,"Like others, I found this studio through a Living Social coupon.  It is a great studio.  Kim is so friendly and fun.  I would highly recommend the yoga classes.  They are both challenging and relaxing!  It is a small studio, but that gives it a really nice, intimate feel.  I definitely recommend it!"
5,"This place is just so so rad. It was about time that AZ has a high end sneaker boutique. The selection of sneakers as well as clothes is above all. No kidding. I bought a pair of limited edition Jordans as a gift here. All of the sneakers here a so unique and fun, and it really puts the fun in sneaker shopping again.  Sure, you can go to finish line and get a pair of sneakers there. And you will see various other people wearing the same ones. If you really want to find funky stuff to express yourself with, this is the place. AND to make it even better...they sell for retail! So markups? Not an issue. Do yourself a favor and check this place out..."
3,"Been here 2 times.  Had I reviewed after my first visit, I wouldve given the place 4 stars.  The server was nice and attentive and the food and drinks were delicious.  Had I reviewed after my second visit, I wouldve given the place 2 stars.  The server was quiet and not as attentive and the food was cold and bland.  Since Im just now getting around to reviewing, I guess Ill give it 3 stars.  Really a bummer when you enjoy a place once only to go back and have a no-so-great experience."
1,"I keep wanting to like this place.  I want to support a local business, and yet.... Last year I took my two boys there after a theater performance (Greasepaint!   Excellent!), and after we placed our orders for lunch, I took out our SET game (its a card game that does not use a traditional deck - great fun).  WIthin moments, the server was back at our table.  ""You cant do that.""  ""What?  Play cards?  Its not gambling."" (Maybe I was wrong, but living here, you start to assume that an objection to something must be religion based).  ""The owners dont allow it.""  ""They dont allow it?  Its a matching game.""  ""No.  Youll have to put it away."" Now.  I would understand not wanting us to sit and play cards if wed finished eating and were just holding a table (assuming it was busy).   However, this was during the gap between ordering and eating.  I KNOW I shouldve just left then.  Instead, I made my kids happy and we stayed for lunch (and ice cream!).   A couple months ago I (foolishly) decided to try again.  Didnt bother with the cards this time.  The lousy thing this time was the mold on my sons bread.  They DID remove the sandwich from the bill, but eish.     Id kind of like the ""Restaurant Impossible"" guy to come in here and give it an overhaul.  I dont mind the nostalgia stuff, but the place does need a solid going over."
4,"The best caesar salad i have ever had. The scallops were tasty, but not as crispy as I like them.  My husband loved his steak. The chocolate lava cake is amazing.  Instead of a little oozing chocolate, there was a lot of oozing chocolate.  And their house chantilly cream is to die for.  I could eat it alone, by the spoonful."
4,"OMG, oh so good. Gives me gas and makes me tired after lunch, but its well worth it."
5,"So.......I love Defalcos. My bf and I are addicted to the Il Purista, which is JUST PERFECTION, with and without the prosciutto. Ive had someone describe their service to me as ""New York style"" and I agree with that assessment, so if you cant hang with it, then go be a baby somewhere else. The food is fresh, delicious, and incredible. Their lattes are bomb, and the cannolis pretty great too. I dont have a single bad thing to say about these folks or their amazing food."
3,"Went here on Wednesday to take advantage of the $30 certificate. It was quite busy, which probably shouldnt of been a shock, location and all, so had to wait awhile but that is the risk of not getting reservations right? =P.  Anyways, spent time in the bar which was nice, the bartenders were willing to answer questions, though not always the most chatty, but I think that was due more to how busy it was then not being friendly. The happy hour prices looked pretty good, $2 hot sake, $3 beer, $4-5 cocktails. Sushi was also on the cheap, Nigiri was from about 1.25-2 dollars I believe, and the other rolls ran from 3-5 dollars at the worst. They also have some non-sushi appetizers on there.  Once we got a table, we were paired with another group, which was actually a nice experience as I do like the communal type seating stuff. Granted if you have a small group and not a fan of eating with strangers, might not like it much.  Since it is a place I always consider more about a show then the food, going to start with that first. The show was eh, they do some of the knife play stuff, and a few things here and there, but honestly it wasnt all that exciting compared to the other place Ive been (Sakura). The chef was friendly though, and the server was personable so that is a plus. Otherwise was a bit disappointed with the show portion of the meal.  As for the food, I had the Filet Mignon and lobster tail. The filet was supposed to be medium, but came out more medium well in my opinion. It was lightly seasoned, leaving mostly a beef flavor then anything else. Now it had a good beef flavor, so by no means complaining just like a bit more seasoning personally. The lobster tail was good, buttery from the butter, but more importantly nice and sweet. How it is to other lobster tails? cant really tell you as I dont eat it that much (college students dont exactly have that sort of cash you know? =P). But again thought it was good, wasnt fishy and nice and sweet.  At the end it came with a choice of ice cream, I tried the green tea ice cream which about the same as any other green tea ice cream Ive had. Basically its sweet, with a hint of green tea taste, and that is about it.  They have to sing to you of course, and they take a picture which they give you with a code you can access for up to 60 days (I believe) to download it, which is a nice touch.  For the money, I really wouldnt go unless I had the certificate, however I would go back for the happy hour, probably my favorite thing of the whole night."
1,"Bleh. Most of us have ventured to the rock at some point in time. It has always been quite awful, but I had some hope after new ownership took over and renovated the place. It is always sad to see a place that has potential, be complete crap. Upon walking in we were greeted by a small room used as a bar area, with random bar tables along the side. And whales. And scary looking people. And a DJ...well...kinda...he was playing music from a computer..you know...like you would so at home. We ordered two beers and sat down. Why not give it a chance, right? Just when we thought that things couldnt get worse, we heard a sound. Like a squealing sound. Yes, you guess right, horrible karaoke ON A FRIDAY NIGHT!?!?! Why God, why????? We chugged our beers and left."
4,= = = = = =  CLOSED  = = = = = = China Star here has now closed.     :-(
5,Amazing. Romantic!
1,"Honestly the drinks are overpriced and have a hint of rubbing alcohol Honestly my lunch was just okay Honestly they have a drink called the stigmata Honestly I am dreading having to give them 2 stars given the hype But, I am supposed to be honest. This place has been the buzz since before I returned stateside. My coworkers had also been hearing the same buzz. We just had to go as the finale to our week of lunch. Yeah, I probably wouldve been better off at the Billet Bar across the street. I mean it is biker week. The people watching wouldve been stellar. The only people watching I had at RnR was the gorgeous server outside our window on the patio. But even his piece of art body wont bring me back. The first hint shouldve really been the overpriced drinks we started with. I figured for that price they should be damn good so I ordered some lime concoction. A coworker got the stigmata. Holy strong... and not in a good way. I mean, I appreciate my drink as much as the next but not when I cant even enjoy it.  One of my other coworkers on the other hand, was enjoying his blue moon. That was until he held it up to take another sip and the entire bottom of his glass fell off.. yes.. fell in one piece.. onto our table. What happened to the contents do you ask? That went all over him, the table, inside someones wallet, and onto an iPhone and my face. The waiter wasnt even really apologetic about it aside from giving us some extra cloth napkins which werent soaking anything up at all. No wet rag, no comp, no apology, nothing but another glass of blue moon we were hoping wasnt bought at a prank store and a sticky table, faces, and sunglasses. The chicken lollipops were not what I expected, but really werent bad. I did enjoy those. I also enjoyed the presentation of my fries. Cute silver bucket. Tons of fries. Couldnt finish. I ended up getting a chicken sandwich that had brie and some other goodness on it. Totally forgot to order it without tomato, but I picked it off easily.  I know what youre thinking, they serve breakfast here til 2pm, why the hell did the breakfast queen not order breakfast. Honestly, none of it wooed me enough that it looked delicious. They had a make your own omelet that was on my short list of things to order, but Im glad I didnt after seeing a coworkers tiny ass omelet and bread with no other side for $10. Also, I highly doubt their Amish french toast is all that Amish. Just sayin. I know a bit or two about Amish goodness. So, back to my lunch.. it was just eh, which was sad. The description sounded so delicious I really was expecting to be wowed.. finally.. after all the mishaps Id had up until this point. I do admit I loved the bread. It was delicious. I also appreciated that despite them not having honey mustard, aioli, or anything else to dip my fries in aside from ketchup and barbeque sauce (which was given with the sweet potato fries.. ew) they tried to make me honey mustard. Unfortunately it was just honey mixed in with bottle mustard ketchup. I ended up using the ranch dressing from the lollipops.  What I paid for this was ridiculous. The way they reacted to the beer mishap was ridiculous. The food was meh. Not even I was tempted to try breakfast there. It was like the beautiful model that has no brains.... and I want some brain thought going into my dining experience. Dont try to woo me with simple sex appeal. One of my coworkers commented that maybe in 6 months when the pans are seasoned well after being used the place will be worth it to try again. I told him maybe. Had to edit that someone from our table got terribly ill too... oy vey!"
5,"Had the best BEST time here tonight! My mama and best girlfriends treated to me a fun day for my birthday and I insisted on wrapping up the afternoon with happy hour on me. Ive never been but we wanted to go somewhere nice and stopped in.  The restaurant is beautiful- we sat in a high back comfy booth in the bar which is really nice. The bar has shelves of backlit colorful liquor bottles above it (ala the Ocean Club bar). We has 2 rounds, including the Vitamin C martini, White Chocolate Martini, Flirtini and Black Cherry cocktail- they were all really great! We also got the colossal shrimp appetizer (which technically werent all that colossal, they were just normal), the sliders (the bacon and maytag bleu cheese was amazing!) and the AZ Eggrolls (a bit on the greasy side but very tasty and perfect for happy hour). The tab was only $65 (it was happy hour and the prices averaged about $6/ drink and app). The service was also extremely good.  Its been a long time since I felt like raving about a restaurant- it was great!"
2,"I was working in Phoenix and was told that I had to try Delux, as they had the best burger and sweet potato fries I would ever have.  The fries were pretty good, but I dont think they were anything above average.  The burger, though, I thought left a lot to be desired.  It was juicy, but I would actually call it more grease-laden than truly juicy.  I like a moist burger, but I dont want grease dripping off the bun.  That was my major problem.  That may be what some people like, but I didnt."
3,"In 1999 the AZ Republic Voted Abacus Inn Best Chinese in the Valley. That is sad because Chinese can be so much better.  But I do have to say that Abacus Inn does something nice that I dont see too often in other Chinese Restaurants. They give you hot tea and water and fresh fried noodles with sauces when you are seated.  I had the Yui Shan Chicken, it was a fail because of the inedible Shiitake Mushroom stems in my dish.  Trying to eat the mushroom stem was like trying to chew a car tire but, I do have to admit the sauce was more developed than any sauced dishes I tried from the surrounding Chinese Restaurants including Bamboo Cafe, Ginger China Bistro, and Shangri La. I LIKED the use of cucumber in the dish was light and tasty and successful. Unfortunately the white meat chicken was dry. Maybe a THIRD STRING cook was on the day I was here and maybe this dish is normally prepared better? The sautéed spicy beef was more successful. The beef was very well prepared and unlike the Yui Shan dish this Spicy Beef REALLY WAS VERY SPICY. I am used to a more developed and balanced Szechuan sauce so I wasnt a fan of this dish from here. But I do note this sauce was better than what youd get from surrounding Chinese Restaurants. The last time I was here I had the sizzling rice dish and that one impressed me because they cook the rice quickly in a very hot oil and puff the rice. Its a toss up between Abacus Inn and Shangri la . Abacus does some more impressive stuff but Shangri la does cook moist chicken."
5,"Lots of cool, cute and educational things here for my two kiddies. I stop in here for each birthday/Christmas to balance out the ""junk"" toys. I love the art project portfolio that is divided by school year and the school memory books. :)"
3,"I adore all of Joes restaurants. That being said, I think this one is my least favorite..(which means its still better than most of the restaurants Ive had the pleasure of dining at in the greater Phoenix area.)  I got the chicken sandwich and it was okay. I think I could have found something on the menu that I would have enjoyed more, but for some reason I wanted to try it. I think Ill have to try the pizza next time, because it looked amazing. The service and atmosphere were great, as per all the Joes establishments.  I wasnt completely fond of standing in line for awhile to get a table and order my food. Sometimes I just want to sit down at a table and have the server come to me after a long day. That being said, I would love to try this place again...especially for breakfast!"
5,"Let me begin by telling you about my horribly debilitating fear of going to the dentist.  Its epic.  Weeks before an appointment I start having nightmares.  Thinking about sitting in the dental chair makes me break out in a cold sweat.  I require nitris oxide for a simple cleaning. The sound of the drill is enough to make me want to claw my face off.  Basically, every visit has been the worst experience ever for the past 30 years.... Enter Dr. Marcia Blazer.  I read about her online when searching for a local dentist here in Scottsdale.  I literally googled ""dentists for anxious patients"", and her name popped up.  Her website appeared too good to be true.  They offered nitris (plus), offered non invasive options for dental procedures (double plus), and offered a staff used to accomodating those with a healthy dose of dental fear. I went in for my first visit (a cleaning and exam), and I was amazed at how comfortable they made me feel.  They were warm and friendly, and put me at ease immediately.  During the cleaning, my least favorite part is always when they use the scrapy,pointy torture device to stab off all the plaque at the gumline.  How happy was I when they used an air abrasion tool instead...felt like a cool stream of water on your teeth, and BAM, theyre clean!  They were so calming, that when I was informed that I had 2 cavities, I didnt even have a panic attack at the thought of coming in. Fast forward two weeks to my filling appointment.  I had requested nitris (hey, I was feeling better but still SUPER anxious), which they had all set up in the room for me when I walked in.  Now heres my favorite part.  As I sat in the chair, the assistant brought over two big boxes full of dvds and asked me what movie I would like to watch during the procedure...What?? So I picked a lighthearted comedy (50 First Dates).  I was then given noise eliminating headphones to use (goodbye horrible drilling sound), nitris (hello happy gas), and a few hand signals to recognize if I was supposed to open or close my mouth.  And we were off!  She didnt try to maintain conversation (soooo annoying when dentists do that), and before I knew it she was done and I was disappointed because my movie wasnt quite over!  I was even told that had my dentist not needed the room I was in for another patient, that I would have been welcome to stay and just finish the movie! I have had several interactions with this office since then (regarding billing and follow up), and every time it is a pleasure to deal with them.  I highly recommend this office to anyone!"
4,"This is our theater of choice in N Scottsdale.  An older theater with no stadium seating, it is still kept in good shape and is clean.   Great prices at $5 a ticket before 6:00, it is the best bargain around since they still show all the new releases!  Our main reason for going here it is never crowded and personally I only like sitting next to someone I came with :0). Thats never a problem here!!"
3,"I had lunch at Villalpandos with a group of co-workers and this place is A-OK. The food wasnt spectacular, but everyone was satisfied with it and the prices are reasonable. The restaraunt was not very busy which makes it an easy place to go to with a large group. The service was friendly and had no problem with making substitutions to the menu items. I do like that they offer chile relleno thats not breaded and fried!"
5,"My husband and I eat out a lot and we had the best dining experience ever the other night! We sat at the bar with the bartender AJ and he was such a delight! We had happy hour which was probably the best deal in town! 5 dollar glasses of wine and half priced appetizers!?! My favorite was the steamed mussels. We loved it so much we also had dinner. The classic pasta deal was the best. Getting to take one home gives you at least two more meals, the next day. Its hard in this economy to get more bang for your buck but Maggianos they are doing it right! We will defiantly be back for more!"
4,Awesome little hole in the wall in Tempe.  There isnt much room to sit and it isnt fancy but if you want good food this is the place to go.  A pasty is basically a calzone(only better) with a variety of different types of fillers.  I had the bangers and mash.  The wife had the Italian.  Everything was great served promptly and with a smile.  Its not Scottsdale fancy and thats what I like about it.  Best part is you can get a hearty meal with a soda for under $10.  If you want beer expect to pay a bit more.
5,Great fruit and vegetables. Bulk items like nuts and cranberries are a good value. Check out the meat and deli. Cage free chicken and grass fed beef. Salmon and Tuna are fresh. They do have some good values here. The cashiers are good and give the nickel bag discount.
5,"Just a quick update.... Took my parents here for lunch today, and now I have 2 more converts! If anyone is still sleeping on this place, shame on you; youre really missing out. Why? DELICIOUS food made from QUALITY ingredients and FRESHLY prepared hot to order. Good stuff all around!"
4,"FAN-FREAKIN -TASTIC! Yes, its a Great steakhouse... but they also have a Great wine selection... and Great bread to start... and Great desserts.... and Great service. Rich and Richie took exceptional care of us.  They were attentive and fun to talk to... too. I had the Prime Rib and it was huge and perfectly prepared. I ended up taking the rest home and having it for lunch the next day and it was just as good the following day.  :) The Bread to start came with 2 different flavored butters.  You could easily fill up on bread before dinner.... so go easy on this as they will keep bringing out refills if you let them. The Dessert.... we got the Chocolate Lava Cake... and the cake part was good... but the sides that came with the cake... they were Amazing.  The Chantilly Cream they serve on the side of the cake is freshly made and its a Little Pillow of Heaven.  Rich brought us more when we ate all the cream and still had cake left.  And then they have a little homemade pistachio cookie with vanilla ice cream on the side too... these were great too... So, net, net... I wouldnt order the Chocolate Lava Cake for the cake part.... Id order it for the things that come WITH the cake.  :) Good for special occassions and if you are looking to have a lovely evening out."
4,"On a Friday night restaurant was busy, but the service was top drawer. Food was very good and we will be back. Prices reasonable."
4,"I think there food is amazing!  However, it is a bit pricey which limits my trips there.  I love the white decor but hate how expensive the drinks are!  I ordered a Key Lime Martini and it was 15.00 for one and served in a tiny little glass!  Come on! Additionally, last time I was there we went to the bar afterwards and most people were wearing flip flops which drives me nuts!  Take a shower, get dressed, put some effort in!  Save the flops for the pub!  Hopefully, it was just an off night because I really think it is a cool spot!"
4,"Im not normally a big fan of Italian food, but after marching six miles against 1070 in the Memorial Day weekend heat, I decided it was time to slang my Groupon on the table and carb it up.  And, fortunately, this was my favorite Groupon find yet. Aiellos is in a beautiful building.  I dont think a building has ever detracted from my eating experience, but in cases like Aiellos, the wonderful shaded, verdant patio set the mood in all the right ways. The inside is low-key family restaurant with a dash of romance.  Nice lighting, not too loud, cool bar. The food was awesome.  Delicious, probably house-made pasta with simple flavors that let the sauces and vegetables sing.  An exhaustive - but not daunting - wine list - though itd be nice to see more options served by-the-glass. As icing on the cake, at the end of the meal, you get to play a game that might let you get your meal for free.  I wont ruin the surprise, but it adds a lot of character. If I had an Italian grandmother, this is the sort of food Id expect shed make.  Highly recommended for a date night, classic dinner-and-a-movie style, for unpretentious delicious fare."
3,"ok....first let me say that I grew up in PHX. And we used to go for special occasions to ""Bobby MaGees"" which is where BobbyQs is now located (says something about the quality of my restaurant experiences as a young fella)...And as cheesy as Bobby McGaees was...i kind of miss the pirate serving me my dinner (and the salad bar in the bathtub). But i do like what they have done to the place. Cool interior. Casual but with a nice upscale feel. The patio seemed really nice (didnt sit out here). We tried a variety of things. A burger, a pulled pork sandwich, brisket, baby backs etc... I think the standout were the ribs. VERY good...very tender (but not overcooked), good sauce.  I enjoyed every one.Everything else was just ok. Like on par with Chilis (which isnt saying much).  The sides were pretty tasty. Corn (roasted and then taken off the cob for you) , mashed potatoes, cornbread...all pretty good.  Dinner for 4 (2 kids, no booze)...50$. But a 5 star place? Maybe in the context of other restaurants in the Dunlap and I-17 areas (next to crazy Mitchs Furniture barn.) But not in the broader context of PHX. I would definitely go back for ribs...but not a place that will go into the normal rotation. Side note: Hilarious crowd on a Saturday night. Lots of ""west side"" clubbers...or maybe too old to be clubbers but want to go clubbing (there is a lounge attached)."
4,"dropped by for lunch with 90yr old and 2 yr old plus hubby. all in all very good. hubby had sausage samich w/fries he really enjoyed it. baby had spaghetti and meatball she ate real good which means it was real good. mom had catfish w/spaghetti and marinara, she ate more than half and the rest went home with her. i had chicken marsala w/marinara on ziti. i subbed the wedding soup for the salad. the service was very quick and attentive. the lamb appetizer was just right with the bread. everything was tasty and very nice presentation. will be back soon, very convenient, very reasonable prices plus a full bar for happy hour. pizza looked very promising, too. take out may also be in my future relationship with lil deemos."
4,"This place is sweet. They are not big on china, glassware or silverware. They use recycled products plates, plastic-ware and drinks in the container they come in (ie a coke in a coke can). The ambiance is awesome. Sweet and funny signs everywhere, reading material, classic rock playing. They only have the radio on but there always seem to be great songs on! They have a large patio out back that is difficult to see from the front but is really nice on a sunny morning.  I havent gotten past the breakfast bowls yet. $6 for 6 toppings, potatoes, buttered toast, and jam. Go ahead and eat carnivore, omnivore or herbivore style (not sure if there are vegan options). Seriously, this $6 breakfast bowl would be $12 at other places served on fine china and with silverware! I dont care about accoutrements like that. Especially when the food is so tasty. The location, midway point of the Melrose District, is stellar. You can spend hours walking up and down looking at retro shops and cool little places. Two Hippies sets a perfect tone for hanging out on 7th Ave!"
5,"I went for brow threading.  Yelena was extremely gentle and took her time making sure they were perfect!  I just found my new ""brow lady"" and shes just across the street from my office! LOVE IT!!!  Give her a try!"
5,"Just because i feel like doing something different. :P im just going to paste some song lyrics that i feel sum up Pei Wei on McDowell... Truth is here the truth is here Truth is here the truth is here Truth is here the truth is here I said the truth is here the truth is here I want more Give me more We want more God damn it Im back to demand we get more We want more I want more and more and more I want more We need more I want more God damn it Im back to demand we get more Give me more I want more and more and more [Verse 1:] I stand here naked as the day I was born Face to the dawn and my faith in the song Blood soaking the pages I painted em on And none of yall will take my place when Im gone Im the pure raw uncut, who the fuck want what Here to show you sucker ass mutts whats the fucks what Brother Ali vow solemnly not to die while the music is still inside of me Its got to be allowed to breathe Got to let it out enough at least to let the monster flee I want more than what your offering me Songs that make me feel like Im already free Im a rebel in my own right Yall dont want to write or think or speak a rhyme standing next to me When the game need it Im exactly what it need Put the soul in the speech, let it go, let it be [Chorus: x2] I want more We need more I want, god damn it Im back to demand we get more Give me more I want more and more and more I said the truth is here the truth is here Truth is here the truth is here Truth is here the truth is here Truth is here the truth is [Verse 2:] Not nearly a single solitary soul Still put the kind of passion to the mic that I hold One day itll have to be pried from my cold dead hand Until then the big man is gold Got one lone reason to go on breathing Climb into the zone of the evening, keep reaching Just to pull more out the core of the deamon The people need to see them pure human being Blood, sweat, love, hate, life, death, joy, pain Little child running wild striped to the raw veins Rugged junkyard dog off the chain, barefoot balls out marching in the rain Sacred war dance suspended in the moment We throw the fuck down like our lives depended on it Jaws of the streets with our heart on our sleeve Throwing shots at the law which is all I believe [Chorus x2] [Verse 3:] Our songs are supposed to be the voice of our soul Not bought and sold, not all controlled Bring a little fire when the world get cold Let me shed a few tears and to me you went gold People need more freedom Children need to hear more truth when yall teach em Damn I want to hear a plan from the dude preaching Got new seeds with true needs and whos leading I truly believe every word Ive ever uttered on a drum break Right or wrong, life go on but it wasnt nothing fake I demand you start listening to the crowd If not - we gon burn this bitch to the ground [Chorus x2] I said the truth is here the truth is here Truth is here the truth is here Truth is here the truth is here Truth is here the truth is the atmosphere is pretty hot here too..exposed brick always makes me Yelp!"
4,"Ive never been to a small size airport like this before so its hard to compare it to another airport. I really enjoy the small size of it, makes it unique. There are basically three buildings, you have the front check-in building, the back building behind the courtyard with gates 1-4 and then a middle building to the side with gates 5 and 6 which also has the baggage claim on the other side of the wall.  I personally prefer Sky Harbor because I can ride the light rail straight there, but this airport does have a bus with half hour frequency. Take route 184, Power Road southbound and it drops off right across from the front door. Everyone seems more friendly here too, probably without having the masses wearing them down everyday, the employees here still have a personality lol.  Great low priced fares from Allegiant, good service, resonable food and drink option and it looks like they are expanding for Spirit Airlines to join this fall (2012). Overall a very good experience, I would suggest this airport as an alternative to anyone living out here near Mesa or if you dont mind the hour drive from the West Valley. I will most likely use this airport again."
5,"We tried this last night for our date night.  We were impressed.  The waitress was amazing in explaining the menu and making suggestions. This is a great place to relax and talk.  The food was great.  I had the Tartiflette...WOW it was so good.  My husband had the La Potence, which is their speciality.  He thought it was great...We will be back..."
4,"Pho is great every time, service is fast and friendly, potstickers are the best I have ever had and they are only $3.50.  Plus %10 discount for Intel employees."
5,"Cibo! Cibo! Cibo!  I love you and your cute old farm house, your amazing pizza, affordable wine, awesome crepe desserts, and fabulous staff! I want to live in the apartment above the restaurant!!  Go to Cibo for awesome food, charming atmosphere, and a great time for a girls night or on a date.  Cibo has quickly become my favorite place in Phoenix!  *Theyre closed on Sundays...found this out the hard way."
5,"This is a cool dive away from all the Old Town BS. The jukebox is one of the best I have heard in some time. They were playing songs I never heard of so I know Im going to be in trouble in the future by using Shazam to identify songs and then buying them from my phone! Anyway, just be sure you eat before you get there as this is all about hanging in a dive and having drinks. They have lots of beer and the bartenders are cool. If I lived closer I would hang out here much more......"
4,"We were staying at the Marriott Canyon Villas and went to Roys for Happy Hour.  Between 4:00 - 6:00 Roys has a great Happy Hour.  $5.00 drinks, including their Hawaiian martinis and $5.00 appetizers.  We had lobster pot stickers, tuna sushi, and California rolls.  All were delicious.  Ive never eaten a meal at the restaurant but if you want a nice little buzz and a pretty full stomach in a lovely environment on a paupers budget, this IS the place.  Dont miss it if you are nearby."
5,The whole market is awesome.I like that if you did not bring enough cash with you that you can pick up a blue ticket at the information booth that the vender will stamp then hold your items for you then you may pay by credit card at the information table where you picked up your ticket.The veg are great.the free range eggs are the best.the french baker from Tucson is pretty darn good.this market is for sure one of the better ones I have seen.worth any one checking out.Note support your local produce and growers/farmers.Support Organic!! One more note this information and option has to do with the farmers market out side open on the weekend from 7am to 11am
4,"Had a nice dinner here with some friends and family last Saturday night and it was really good.  The eggplant parmesan was good, but two of us could have split it.  They serve it on top of a big pizza crust, so it is very filling.  My son had the God Mother pizza which had bacon, pesto and fresh mozzarella.  The pizza was in the shape of a guitar.  He liked it, but wasnt thrilled with the bacon.  It would have probably been better with just the two main ingredients.  The restaurant is casual and hip at the same time."
4,Very interesting sweet and sour had kind of a spice to it but good. The pork itself wasnt my favorite but it was good. The rice was very sticky. Unfortunately I had to get it to go so  I missed out on a lot that the great food specials have to offer. But I would def go again.
3,"I went here this morning for breakfast with the BF to use our living social deal. We had been to black bear before about 6 years ago in glendale and then again maybe 4 years ago up in Washington state. The last time we went, we were not terribly thrilled with the place. Anyway, we decided to give them another shot and it was pretty decent. I had the shasta scramble, which has avocado, onion, bell pepper, and spinach. This was good, it was not the most flavorful scramble I have ever had, but the veggies were fresh and I liked that this was an option on their menu because most places only have one veggie scramble and it has tons of veggies thrown in with no reason for those veg to go together...anyway, the breakfast came with a ton of country potatoes which I liked more than the typical hash brown. The BF got the one biscuit and gravy breakfast and he said it was alright, not the best ever, but not bad. I thought breakfast here was better than Dennys or Ihop, but clearly not as good as the Farmhouse or Liberty Market and the like of local breakfast places. The service was also good, but I thought it was so weird because our waitress kept calling us kids and calling me sweetie, princess, and honey. I find this somewhat condescending, not that I think that was her intention, but I think that is unnecessary. I know this is kind of a diner thing, but I have never really cared for us, but maybe thats just me. The waitress was good at her job and attentive though, so that is whats important. Also, the portions are huge and I wish they had more options for half meals because I dont like to waste food, but I know people like the giant portion thing.... I would probably come back here for breakfast again sometime, however, because it is decently priced and has decent flavor."
3,"I went to this place on a friends recommendation, but have only eaten the custard. The lemon is quite refreshing and fluffy although I wish is was a little less sweet. This is a great place to visit after a light meal in downtown Mesa if you are looking to satisfy your sweet tooth, but not go overboard. The service is fantastic and the parking is ample as they have a private lot. The inside of the restaurant is quite charming and diner like. If you are really looking for the full experience of frozen custard, eat it outside in the never-ending, relentless Arizona sun...you will truly feel the refreshment!"
5,"Last week, I had my first appointment at Pure Dental. Dr. Kang and the office staff were all really nice and helpful. Dr. Kang even did my cleaning and it was very thorough. Ive never had the actual dentist give me my cleaning. I was wowed by their modern equipment to view x-rays and the doctor even took pictures of my teeth to show me. I will be going back to get some filings next week and was told I could watch a movie while I was getting them done."
3,"I think I went the wrong way, but I ended up doing a very isolated trail that wasnt too scenic, but at least it was quiet.  It sort of just ""ended"" though and didnt wrap around.  So then I walked the same way back which was kind of boring.  I like trails that are on loops."
3,"I dont usually write reviews very often (in fact ever).  But I felt that the 4.5 stars does not currently reflect my previous sushi experience here.   First off, the service here was really good.  The waitress was really nice, very prompt and courteous and provided the food quickly.  The food itself, was prepared well, I usually eat a lot of nigiri and the pieces are ok in amount of fish, the rice was packed well and the quality of the fish was good. The major downside in my opinion is that its pricier than I expected.  I wish Yelp would provide ""2.5 dollar signs"".  Granted, I did not come for ""Happy Hour"" which ends relatively early at 5pm.  I go to a lot of sushi restaurants and for the amount of fish provided, I would have expected it to be cheaper. Also, the edamame cost $$.  Even the miso soup is not complimentary.  Considering the above average price, Ive been to too many other places that have the same price, same quality, and provided the necessities for free.  Oh, I even forgot that a bowl of white rice for my child was even a charge.   So, the nickel and dime of things I would have expected compounded with the surprisingly above average price, I can only say that Yen Sushi was ""ok"".  The other two people in my party (minus the children) also agree."
1,"Avoid at all costs. Awful service, slow as hell, only uses disposable plasticware/plates to add landfill insult to heinous food.  Despite telling them we were in a rush to catch a plane and multiple reassurances that the food would arrive in plenty of time, they lollygagged around and I ended up paying $30 to be seriously pissed off and hungry with no food.   BLECH."
1,"what can I say about Glam... well, i really, really despise it. Every time I go there, I regret the decision. And in my grandiose style, Im going to say why in a list: 1) Cash only!! But listen to this, the bartender will take your debit card, charge you a fee, and give you cash, which you can then use to buy drinks from the same bartender that just did the whole transaction. WHY????  2) The location kinda blows. Its in a weird strip mall across from another strip mall. Have you ever driven by there in the day time? Its shady then, imagine at night time. 3) too hipster. I feel like I am not allowed there as I work for the man, do not wear black leggings, or have razor cut bangs. I, in my mall clothing and ""mainstream"" style, stick out like a sore thumb. 4) The music is just a little off.... ii dunno how to say what I am thinking, its just off. Okay, the floor is fancy. Thats about it. (sorry, Im a bar snob and Glam deserves my wrath)"
5,"Dr. Farnsworth is the Jam. I had my first ever eye exam, and she was kind enough to take good care of me.  She did a complete, and thorough eye exam, and explained each test, and the importance of them. After the exam, we determined, that I indeed needed glasses. At that point, my prescription was handed over to the very sweet optician who took care of me and let me try on about a dozen different frames before I found the winning pair. Ive sadly lost them in Vegas, but I will soon be back to buy my next pair so that I am not blind as a bat. LOVE YOU GUYS!"
5,"I have lived steps away from this place for years and a few months ago, my boyfriend suggested I give it a try. Since Im very picky with mexican food places, I had doubts, but boy was I wrong! All I can say is wow!!! This place is amazingly delicious. I thought I would never find a place who served authentic Mexican tacos and out of the blue I found it in a hole in the wall strip mall and just steps from my house! This can be a good thing, but also a dangerous thing because I am trying to lose weight.  This place is so good. I got two tacos and I know I will be going back again and again."
4,"I would echo many of the positive things others have mentioned about Phoenix City Grille. Everything I had here was just downright good. Ribs were mouthwatering, fall off the bone, marinated fresh each morning and not overcoated, perfect. Really didnt even need the sauce they had such flavor already. Black bean soup was nice and the chopped salad was real good too with a nice peanut dressing. Nice wine list with plenty of affordable by-the-glass options. And the server we had was nice too, my companion and I stumbled in after a hike to Piestewa Peak and were definitely underdressed, but everyone was nice about it and they clearly wanted out business and valued us as customers. If I lived in this area of Phoenix, this would be in my rotation for sure."
5,"I first saw them Saturday morning at the Phoenix Public Market and told myself that I would have to try them soon. I was too full from all the sampling with the different vendors. My coworkers and I went to check out the food trucks that gather on Thursday outside of Whole Foods by Raintree and the 101. I saw that Mojo Bowl was there and made my mind up right away to get their food. I decided to get the Red, White, and Kale salad. I love quinoa and kale so it was the obvious choice for me. I also wanted to try one of their smoothies out. I went with the Coco Coca. The description mentioned that it was like a drinkable Almond Joy and I was sold right there. The total came to $13, not too shabby considering the portions. I didnt even touch my salad because the smoothie was so fulling, definitely a meal in itself. Towards the end of the work day I was getting hungry and decided to try some of the salad. I was asked if I wanted a balsamic or raspberry vinaigrette to go with the salad. I told the guy whatever tastes better and he told me that would be the raspberry vinaigrette. The salad was delicious. The kale was chopped up so finely that it really didnt have a taste so if youre not a huge fan of kale you might still like the salad. The portion was huge, it was good for 2 meals.  I try to eat healthy and like to support local businesses. Mojo Bowl definitely brings those two together for me. I cant wait to try more of their smoothies and food out soon!"
5,"Great service, atmosphere and of course great food. My wife and I decided on Blue 32 last night for dinner. We have been there many times, but we felt we needed to share our experience.  We enjoyed sitting at the bar having a few drinks and visiting other patrons. Around 9:50 we realized the kitchen would be closing. I asked Daniel and Baeley the bartenders what time the kitchen served ""dinners"" of course he stated 10:00pm ""OOPS"". But Daniel said they would prepare what ever we wanted.  I asked him to check to see if they have already started to clean up first. We do not like to ask the kitchen staff to prepare dinner if they had already began or completed clean up. Daniel returned to say that yes they had finished the grill, but he again repeated that they would still prepare anything we wanted. At that time we declined to have the kitchen staff prepare anything. But a moment later, Roman the chef came up to us and sincerely stated that he would be more than pleased to prepare whatever we wanted. Still we were not wanting to make such a request  that late, but with his sincere and friendly personality he still insisted that they were more than willing.  So we asked him to pick  and prepare something of his choice which turned out to be the best two burgers that we have enjoyed in a long time, a Bacon Cheese Burger and his speciality Texan Jalapeno  Burger both with extra crispy bacon just the way we like it. SOOOOO....we would highly recommend Blue 32 and its staff including by name, Roman the chef and Daniel and Baeley the bartenders.  Every time we have gone to Blue 32 we have had nothing but a great experience, this place is a must!!!"
5,"This is not a fancy place.  Its address is on Scottsdale Road, but its easier to get to from Shea, about a block east of Scottsdale.  Its split into two sections.  As you walk in, if you head to the left, there is a bar with a couple of pool tables.  I cant really say that Ive spent any time in that section.  We head to the right, where there is a central bar, with booths along the walls.  If you are into Karoake, this is a great place to go.  The DJ has a great voice, and many of the usuals do as well (of course there are quite a few who dont, but thats to be expected).  Weve been here dozens of times, and never not had a good time.  Its casual, and very reasonably priced.  The food is way above average for this casual of a bar.  The shrimp are spiced to perfection, and the chili is to die for."
4,"I went here with a party of 4 on Saturday night and it was surprisingly dead.  Not that thats a bad thing because I dont like crowds.  The place is pretty sheik but you still feel like youre in a hotel.  Service was fast and friendly but I think it was our waiters first night or something.  He was very awkward but it was ok. I was pissed we couldnt get the happy hour menu/prices in the main dining room.  I know it is common practice for crowded places full of douchebags, but the bar and the main dining room were pretty empty so wtf? Im a vodka guy and their vodka menu is pretty neat.  They have 8 or 9 unique vodkas from around the US and clearly list their name, where they are from and the price.  What I didnt like was their martinis.  Pretty much the worst Ive ever had anywhere.  Tiny pours and full of ice chips.  It was like a vodka slushy (oh snap I think I just invented something!!!). Here is a rundown of the food: * bread to start - excellent...love the lightly buttered and salted top * tomato and mozzarella salad - excellent - one of the best ive ever had.  great dressing and ample balls of fresh mozzarella. * pretzel fondue - the pretzels were excellent but the fondue and mustard were no bueno.  the fondu was gritty and the mustard lacked the kick that I love on pretzels. * burger - pretty solid but nothing special * mac n cheese with Shriners sausage - very unique and very tasty.  it was worth having once but I wouldnt get it again. * tater tots - perfectly cooked.  salty/crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the inside.  The only thing that would have made these better is some type of aioli or other special dipping sauce other than ketchup. The main dishes of the other people in my party looked excellent.  I should have been more adventurous and gone with something more than a standard burger.  Maybe next time.  I was going to give this place 3 stars but I just cant.  They try to think out of the box to create dishes that are unique, have fresh ingredients, and have a local twist.  I will return."
4,"This was our last stop on the Urban Wine Walk yesterday, and it was a great place to end the day.  Because this was our last stop, we were too late to get the wine special, however we decided to stay and grab a table on the gorgeous patio and get a (full) glass of wine.  We also ordered some sweet potato fries to munch on. The patio was awesome and I love how the ""inside"" opened up to become an extension of the patio, or vice versa.  We were lucky enough to be experiencing one of those perfect Arizona days and I felt like I was sitting in a good friends cute, cozy backyard . . . with table service.  Speaking of the service, no complaints from me! The original plan was to get dinner, but the wine, fries, and good conversation were enough to fill us up and take us to the end of the night.  I cant wait to go back (soon, to enjoy the patio) and try all of the delicious food I was reading about on the menu and now in everyones reviews!"
4,"When you go to a place called ""Fajitas"" you order the dang namesake! Ive had all the different fajitas they offer and I love all them, my favorite is the shrimp its lightly seasoned and grilled to perfection (side note: order the onions and pepper caramelized)! The tortillas are strong enough to fold without tearing yet still have a nice flavor. The toppings are always bright and fresh, the guacamole is legit. My coworker has talked me into always ordering a side of Queso with the free chips and salsa. Albeit the restaurant is old but the staff is super friendly and detail oriented. And yes, no matter what you order you will smell like fajitas so make sure you dont have anywhere special to go after eating here."
5,I try and eat here regularly. Hummus is great. Very personable staff. And the atmosphere is awesome. Look forward to the next time!
5,While we were in Mesa AZ for a holiday we found Alessias on Yelp and we are so glad we did. The food was delicious and the host was terrific as were the servers. We are not big wine drinkers but they have a very good selection of wines and the host knows his stuff and can make good recommendations. Nicely appointed little restaurant with a great menu.
4,"I am a huge fan of the Italian beef and of course everyone is going to have their favorite places and tastes. But this seemed like a place to satisfy a lot of different tastes. There are several sizes, extra meat is available and if you are getting it to go, Id say go for it! Only order it regular if you are a fan of super dry sandwiches. Id say go for wet if you are like lightly moist but if you are a big au ju fan like I am, definitely hook it up with the dipped!! They have american, cheddar and provolone cheese (pretty sad they didnt have the mozzarella). They giardiniera was pretty good as were the sweet peppers. It wasnt too greasy or hard to eat while driving. They did have a variety of other things to eat so definitely check those out if you arent up for a beef...but thats what they are known for!!"
4,"Enjoyed sitting outside and the barra viejo shrimp dish.  I didnt find anything ""to die for"" but its good.  More importantly it was a nice evening and I enjoyed the experience very much.  My waiter was very laid back and friendly.  I didnt feel rushed and was able to have a relaxed dinner.  Case in point- Im usually a one-drink girl, but I had 2 that day."
5,"I am a transplanted Midwesterner, so I love me some breakfast.  And by breakfast I mean:  Hashbrowns, sausage, bacon, pancakes, and biscuits and gravy.   Mike and Rhondas makes a mean breakfast with huge portions.  For $7 you can have bacon/sausage/ham with hashbrowns, 2 eggs, and biscuits & gravy/pancakes/toast.  Come hungry or share. They also serve classic american lunch fare:  burgers, chicken strips, fries, meatloaf, etc."
4,Great chai lattes and friendly service!
4,"House of Tricks is a great place for dinner if youre looking to go out for a special occasion. Its not somewhere Id go on any given night, seeing as how the bill is about $100 for a dinner for two.  I appreciated the menu having a good deal of seafood on it, as I dont eat any red meat. We had the scallops as an app. - while the serving was small (as expected), the scallops were the prettiest ones I have ever seen! For dinner I had the ahi tuna - it was WAY bigger than I expected, I couldnt even finish it - but my date didnt hesitate to finish it for me.  We sat outside as the sun was setting. The atmosphere was pretty much perfect except for one thing. We were seating next to the concrete wall separating the restaurant from the street. If youre sitting at the tables next to the wall, Id say it comes up to your elbows. Anyway, there were ants crawling all over the wall and it made me kind of uncomfortable and itchy.  Our server was a young guy who could have washed his shirt a few times before wearing it again. Otherwise, he was pretty cool - sort of a no sense of urgency kind of server - but we werent in too much of a hurry anyway."
3,The felt that the food at Organ Stop was just So-So! Nothing special! The Music there is great! You defiantly go to Organ Stop for the Organ! Not the Pizza!
5,Postinos in Gilbert was stunning! Amazing outdoor/indoor chic atmosphere.  Food and wine were excellent as expected! What another great addition to the Postino family! Loved it!!!!!
5,"twas the night before booyah and all the through the city people were piecing  some pretty shitty costumes together at savers, good will george w bush clintons, bill and hill jay-z & beyonce biden and obama even saw kanye oprah, super mamma yep, octomom brad pitt & jolie and men as madonna and lynn sue cooney  i went to Easleys to see what they had of course, it was madness every kid, mom and dad crammed into the isles pulling on wigs vampire masks and noises of pigs all being assisted  by the yellow teed staff so very helpful no panic, just laughs ""yes we have liberace in fact, we have two try both of them on ill grab em for you"" they found me a boa a wig and make up took just fifteen minutes case opened and shut and all around me this repeated itself the people rolled in pleased people rolled out into the darkness parties around town wonder how many were out gettin down in get ups from Easleys im guessing a ton so check out Bert Easleys make up, magic, fun bright yellow building south side of mcdowell since nineteen sixty four makin halloween, howl"
5,"The sushi was fresh and excellent! The service was almost too fast. I did not find the prices to be out of line with the quality.  Our daughter loved the miso soup. The one thing I really appreciated is that they will make what you want, whether it is on the menu or not. If they have it, you can get it. I know well be going there often.  One thing though, this is a busy, noisy place. It is not large either. If you are looking for quite and relaxed, this perhaps isnt the best choice. If you want good food in a noisy cheerful atmosphere, like a bunch of friends or after work, this fits the bill."
4,"Icey iced ice... tasty and refreshing, Ritas delivers.  You cant help but smile as you walk in the door, anticipating the tasty goodness that is lined up in front of you.  They have simple cream ice, milkshakes, gelati, Italian ices, frozen custard, frozen custard cookies... and on and on.  We stopped by on a random, warm afternoon after passing the new store and noticing the sign... a few samples later, we were sure that wed found a winner.  My only ouch came when I found out the calories and fat in my Blendini mix.  :-/  Glad I shared it!  Well just make Ritas an occasional splurge. Yum... Blendini!  We recommend the Vanilla custard with Toffee. :-D   See ya there!"
4,Never had a bad meal or a bad beer here.  Great selection of brews and the food that they make is simple and GOOD.  Great recipe for success.  Service is a little spotty but expected due to the fact that these are college students who really (speculating here and actually giving the benefit of the doubt) dont care too much about customer service - its just a job to them.
5,"Four Peaks baby.  This spot is awesome.  Great place to meet up with a crowd, grub, and pound some craft brew.  The food is great: dope appetizers , rockin burgers, decent pizza, and daily specials.  The beer is fantastic, hop knot being my fave.  They have happy hour everday from 3-7 and 10-close with dollar off beers, a light night menu, TVs, and a pool table.  Ive gotten mashed here more than a few times.  Sunday brunch is killer, and may I suggest you try the Stout milkshake, a little known secret, but good for the sweet toof.  Dont miss out on the Peaks."
4,"Great China   chinese restaurant and super buffet there is no the in the name.But there is some good food inside the place.the decor is average and are booth was comfy but well worn.The buffet had about 80 items ,about the super buffet requirement.They had a small sushi section and the sushi was very tasty.The wonton soup i had was very hot and good it had most of your typical trays with a couple of different twists on some like the stuffed clams were huge and and they had some good sole,that thet called snow fish?When i left this place i was stuffed and everything i ate was good.So yes Great China gets 4 stars.And for Norm R. they got the almond cookie packages"
3,"The 3rd star is because they have EVERYTHING.  And you cant beat the prices.  And as far as crowded, budget conscious mega stores, this is definitely on the cleaner side, even with their current renovation project going on. The dark side...  it IS a very crowded mega store, especially at the later hours.  And as crowded as it gets from 9pm-1am, theres usually only 2 checkers, which makes for LONG lines.   If you can hit this place during a quieter time, earlier mornings or early evenings, then you can get what you need without breaking the bank."
5,"A very reliable local garage. Bill is all about great customer service, and goes the extra mile. He deflated my fears about ""being taken"" by other mechanics playing on my automotive ignorance. Hes a truly good guy, knows his stuff, and will work to save me money if he can find it. I trust Bill, and 25th Street Automotive. Thanks, and well continue to bring our wheels into your shop."
5,Best Steak Ever. That is all.   Everything on the menu is amazing. Go now.
5,"I am a big fan of this place, either to stop in on a slow Sunday just to see what they have.  Their stock rotates pretty frquently so always new interesting things to find.  So far Ive bought a vintage print, an awesome dress that I have received tons of compliments on, cool earrings, and some other kitchen items.  The staff are always friendly.  When you go, make sure you check out the Burt Reynolds beefcake poster they have behind the counter. Great strore!"
4,"Last night was my first adult play experience. I have been to the theater to see the Nutcracker when I was a kid and I saw the Lion King in New York when I was a kid as well. I remember them being fun, but thats about the extent of my memories of the theater. There happened to be a groupon for the play ""The Mystery of Irma Vep"" that my mom purchased for the four of us (mom, myself, husband, sister) to attend.  We got there a bit early after dinner and walked around the theater looking at the art that was up around the building. There were places you could grab a drink and relax before the show. At our call time we went in and found our seats. We were up on the balcony in the fifth row pretty much right in the center. We had really good seats. The only thing about this theater that made me uncomfortable and keeps it from attaining that fifth star were first of all the seats. The backs were extremely straight and having a back condition it makes sitting up that straight difficult for long periods of time. The second thing that was a bit uncomfortable was the temperature of the theater. It was a bit warmer than I would have liked. I left coated in a film of sweat. Not pleasant. I was nervous I wasnt dressed appropriately having never been to the theater before, I went in jeans and a t-shirt, but I am glad now that I did because it would have been much more uncomfortable in one of my nice silk dresses than in jeans.  However the show was hilarious. The part that made it for me was when one of the characters started singing the Rebecca Black ""Friday"" song. Classic! Most of the people in the theater didnt get the reference so there were only a few pockets of young people laughing when it happened. But I found it to be a nice touch and after a play full of references I didnt get, I liked that there was something for us young folk thrown in. The rest of the show was funny, and I am glad that I got to experience it.  After coming here I am interested in becoming more active in plays and am looking into seeing a ballet soon. All of us really enjoyed this, and I was surprised my husband liked this as much as he did. A good time had by all!"
4,A non-red meat eater walked into The Keg....thats how my story starts!  I am not known for making trips to a steakhouses but I have to say I like this place.  The staff are super friendly and are eager in helping you make a selection of drinks or food.  I highly recommend the Strawberry Lemonade!  Supposedly theres Gin in this drink but I did not taste a drop!  I tried the Teriyaki Chicken with a yummy pineapple cilantro salsa!  I chose the Twice Bake Potato as my side....omg theres bacon it!  This was amazing and I need the recipe!  They dont have a bad happy hour menu.  I wont change my non-red meat eating ways but I will continue to visit the Keg.   *Side note: Yes I eat bacon.  I dont eat Red Meat by choice and not for a cause.
5,"This is my favorite seafood place in Phoenix!!!! I have loved this place since it opened when I worked at Nordstrom years ago!  They have a great happy hour.  There are not many places that you can get a $5 cosmo, appletini, and lemon drop martinis...not many!!  They are not Grey Goose martini but they are delicious all the same!  They offer greta choices from their menu on their happy hour menu as well...of course they have a fabulous happy hour its because its the same owner as Roaring Fork and their happy hour is to die for... Anyways...their menu... The potstickers are just something different that you would not expect...and they are delicious!  I love the crab cake too!  A guilty pleasure is the bacon wrapped shrimp with goat cheese and the onion rings!! OMG!!  I cannot get enough of the lobster tacos too!!  I could just have the appetizers for dinner!  I do often!  Also, I love the Fuji Apple Salad because the candied walnuts just make you want more and more and more...the dressing just tops it all off... Now the entrees that I love are the Crab stuffed shrimp with the vinaigrette...It is FABULOUS!!  Of course...if you love lobster tail this is the place to get it!  You get two of them!  Now make sure that it is the right season because they are not cheap, but they are so worth it! The sides to get are the twice baked potatoes, truffled mac and cheese, and sauteed spinach!  They are fantastic!"
4,"Ill give this one a four for atmosphere and BEER... and Steve the manager. He rocks. The food- eh. I dont go for the food. So last 4th of July, we were having a keger. Hubski went to pick up the keg from Four Peaks (ice cold Kiltlifter) and there were some waitresses talking about the 4th and how they have no idea what its about. Well hubski shows up and tells them all whats what. Now weve got a friend in Steve forever. Everytime we are there, he takes a break to chill with us. We got a tour of the facility. This is cool- the Kiltlifter is supposed to be a Scottish beer. Four Peaks actually has biologists balance the water to match the chemicals to Scottish water. The same with the Hefe- the water matches German water. This is all so that we can have the most delicious and authentic beer possible. Four Peaks is a laid back place, great beer, good people-watching. Bar food."
2,"They must have had a slammed lunch as I came in around 1:30 ( by the time I found my way back from the old station) and for a new place the counters were dirty.   I hate when the counter help is eating in the dining room, I feel like I am inconveniencing them.  The vegetarian choices are limited and the Pho was good for 8 bucks.  I have eaten Pho at another place in Mesa and enjoyed it more.  I wont run back to this one but if someone else was paying and wouldnt cave to other suggestions I would not die of it either."
4,"Came here on a Thursday night and it was quite busy!  Maybe all the snow birds are still in town.  I made rezs and we arrived early,yet they had no plan as to where we sit. We ended up sitting on the Patio. Which would be nice in the summer or spring but , a bit chilly for Jan.    They had 2 heaters outside.  However, we were just a little to far away to feel them.     We ordered a pitcher of the red Sangria wine, which they said they were out, but alass when they saw how dissappointed we were they made more!     We were very happy about that so that gives them extra points.        However, the Sangria was loaded with ice and there was ice in the wine glasses as well which made us even more cold.  Skip the ice when it is in the 40s outside.    We had the large Capresse salad which was excellant...The basil and cheese were huge and very tasty. Pizza was absolutly divine! Great crust ,wonderful mushrooms , and excellant Italian Sausage.                                                                                      Bathrooms were clean and parking can be a bit of a challenge.   Lacks a bit of atmosphere. The busboys were very attentive i give them extra points as well they were really working hard."
5,"Ladies in the flooring section are very knowledgeable and helpful.  Though I do think they are a bit understaffed, they were gracious and friendly.  Fairly large in stock flooring section compared to other stores."
5,"Their frozen drinks carried me through last summer. They have free air (for your tires) and water (for the radiator) at every location Ive ever been to. Their hot sandwiches, though greasy, arent TOO greasy and actually taste like food. The coffee is pretty good, and they have more ways to tart it up than Starbucks does. QT frickin rocks. And BTW, the QT stands for Quick Trip."
5,"Ive been eating here more and more often lately, and I like the food.  If I want Mexican food, and I am in the downtown chandler area, this is where I stop in. The food quality is consistent.  Being a creature of habit, I get the same thing every time I come here. They are also serving cupcakes.  Looks like the change the flavor every once in a while too.  I have had a margarita flavored one, and a dark chocolate and chili one.  Tasty."
4,"I was surprised here for my birthday and it is a very romantic, old-school, traditional great service kind of place. The low lighting and small dining rooms make for a great ambiance.  The dual menus, one french-ish and one southwestern-ish are sort of on odd pair, but it is Scottsdale. The appetizer, shrimp ""beinets"" were simply breaded, fried and very greasy while the lavender dipping sauce and salad that came along with were much more appealing. Both our entrees were wonderful and perfectly cooked - so well in fact, the sides were essentially meaningless, even though I remember them as fairly good also. So if you find yourself here, keep the Ahi Tuna and the Wild Boar in mind.  The wine menu is extensive and filled with surprises.  The wait staff were classic in service, yet easily engaged in conversation and very friendly. They only acted snobby for the people who expected it, we on the other hand provided the Diamondbacks/Rockies scores and had a great time! We ended the night with great Grand Marnier birthday souffles.  Great place, people and food - we would go back."
5,Had the meat pizza last night and it was truly one of the best pizzas Ive had in a long time.  The owner is always very welcoming and warm hearted!
4,"This place is fantastic - very tasty and a nice surprise for the Tempe area.   Tempe seems to be full of places meant for those in college (makes sense because it is, in fact, a college town) - but for those of us who work in the are this is a nice break from the regular places.  I will be adding this to my list of lunch options.  It is really nice when you are looking for a light salad or even quiche.  I would recommend this."
3,"I met some friends last night at Cadillac Ranch and this was my first time going. The space has a very odd layout, but there are two bars (one inside and one outside on the patio) and both have plenty of TVs to watch. There is also a very cliche mechanical bull, but unfortunately (or maybe fortunately) no one rode it while I was there. Service at the bar was really good, but when our group moved to a table, service became spotty. We had two servers for our table of 11 and one would take a drink order or would be asked for something and then not deliver it or something would get missed...the two servers just didnt coordinate very well. Luckily we werent in a hurry and were a pretty laid back group. I only ate the Cadillac salad (mixed greens, tomatoes, cheese and croutons) and it was a nice size for $7.95. However, and maybe this is just a pet peeve of mine, but I hate when restaurants put the dressing on for you! I prefer for it to come on the side, as it does in almost every single restaurant I have ever been to, so I can put on as much as I would like. I did try a few of my friends fries and they were good...not oily and for fries, they were actually pretty light. As a note, for groups, they put an automatic 20% gratuity on the bill, not the standard 18% most other places do. Overall, I wouldnt recommend this place as a lunch or dinner destination as I was not impressed by the menu or the entree prices which seemed on the high side for what they were. However the three stars I am giving Cadillac Ranch are for their happy hour: $2 domestics $3 imports $3 Fat Tire bottles $3 Flavored Smirnoff Vodka drinks $3 Margaritas $4 Rum (Captain Morgan) $5 Vodka Martinis $3.50 to $5ish select appetizers (there are about four or five) Im always happy when I can get Stella drafts for cheap. Also, according to the bartender, one of the margaritas they serve can only be purchased a maximum of 4 times by one person because it is so strong. One piece of advice: If you start at the bar and move to a table, close your tab at the bar even if they offer to transfer it to your table. We had a huge mess last night and some people overpaid and some of us underpaid."
3,"Had lunch at Zinc for the first time recently right as they were opening.  Considering they were not yet busy, we had pretty mediocre service.  To begin with, we were not offered bread.  Since it was our first visit, I wouldnt have necessarily assumed we would get bread, but I noticed other tables had it, so naturally I felt slighted.  And then the cardinal sin of serving.  I was maybe 25% through my meal, when our server appeared with our check and asked if we would like dessert.  Well, I dont know.  I havent really eaten yet.  My husband wasnt even finished, and he eats like hes still in the military.  Needless to say, I just took the check and short-changed her tip in return for short-changing the time I was apparently allotted for eating.  As for the food.  I had the macaroni au gratin with smoked ham as well as their up sell of parmesan truffle fries.  I liked the mac and cheese.  Not the best Ive had, but pretty good.  The fries were okay.  But Ive never understood the concept of dressing up plain ole french fries and serving them with ketchup.  If Im not going to get a nice aioli or some other special dipping sauce, Id rather just have the fries sans all the other crap. I wouldnt necessarily object to a return visit if Im in the area, but I wont be breaking down their door.  Just as well, I doubt they would care."
4,"The name sounds like its straight out of a book filled with a happy storyline, friendly characters and sunny days. And Chestnut Lane, the eatery, lives up to expectations. For the ultimate lady who lunches, this should be # 1 in her book.  I discovered this lunch spot awhile back and immediately made my way there to check it out. From day one, I was hooked and have visited several times. Chestnut Lane is small, quaint and every bit as charming as the house they call home. When I first walked in, I saw gorgeous fresh salads to the left, begging me to take them home. Fresh pastries, cookies and cupcakes lined the counter top and refreshing water made their home in reusable milk-type jars in the refrigerator. The owner runs the shop and takes great care of the environment and the food they serve. From ladies who lunch, to professionals on the go...this spot is normally packed during lunch hour, so get there early.  My favorite dishes include: the lobster salad (worth every penny), the tuna meld, chopped salad and honey roasted chicken blt. Its hard to escape without a bag of their delicious cookies or a mini cupcake. If its mini, that means zero calories right? :) For those looking for a healthier option, their fresh fruit is full of amazing berries, etc.  Hours: Better hurry and make it during store hours! Chestnut Lane is only open Tuesday-Friday from 8-3 and Saturday from 8-1."
4,"Great city atmosphere with lots of bright open windows looking out at Central Avenue.  Nice place to relax as the world rushes by outside.  Comfortable seating areas and great beverage assortment.  Danielle Libreras baked goods are the stars here as far as im concerned, i went in at 7 am one morning and was delighted to see the entire front counter filled with her creations (scones, muffins, fruit tarts, quiche, cookies and still warm from the oven coffeecake).  It was like a bakery buffet, danielle is right there baking away behind a corner of the counter on most mornings.  I often go to Lola in the evenings (they close at 7 most nights, so sad) and by that time of day there are only a few cookies left, so obviously the regulars are tuned into the best time of day to get the baked goodies.  A guy in front of me on my 7 am visit scooped up half a warm coffeecake to deliver home to some lucky partner/roommate.   The morning we visited, the 7-8 am hour was peaceful and calm, a great waking up time.  It was nice to see an assortment of dads and their young 5-7 year old sons come thru the door and spend time hanging out together at the start of the day.  At 8 am the business commuter crowd started arriving in full force and the place got a whole lot more buzz from all of the conversations going on.   Great location approx 1/2 block south of the Central/Camelback light rail stop.  Definitely worth a visit!"
3,"I ate here over the weekend while attending Comicon.  I was actually pretty hungover at the time and desperately needed to plug my gut.  It was between this and a deli I saw a little bit down the way but pizza always, always sounds good so I made my decision.  In my mind, in a fight between a pizza and a sandwich, the pizza would always win because it has the power of molten-hot cheese and pepperoni shields. Yay:  It was like $6 bucks for a big slice of pizza and a salad and a drink.  Thats a really, really good deal.  The salad that I got wasnt like an amazing salad but it had onions on it and croutons and had a strong flavor.  It wasnt bad.  If I were a teacher and my class assignment was, ""Throw a salad together super quick and cheap,"" and I got that salad, Id give it a B. Nay:  The pizza was not so good.  But, you know, it was pizza and pizza is hard to fuck up so it was salvageable.  The big problem was that it was so greasy.  I mean the pizza sweat grease like a fat mans back.  If I were a teacher and my class assignment was, ""Make me a cheap ass piece of pizza that tastes good,"" Id give this slice of pizza like a C.  I choked that shit down though and washed it down with salad and raspberry iced tea. So, you know, the pizza wasnt great, but after I got done eating I felt a lot better.  I had the strength and energy to check out Comicon for the rest of the day.  I geeked out good."
5,My fav Mexican place by far!  They make the most delicious chicken tortilla soup and tacos Ive ever eaten. Fresh ingredients and the owners are super nice. Love this place!
1,"Slow, unorganized and filled to the brim with crazy people. I prefer to do everything through the service arizona website but recently got a letter that I needed to get a new license because my picture was going to expire. It makes total sense that my license is valid until Im 65 but the picture expires after 11 years. Of course, the state charges a nominal fee of $12 to replace it. If the state of AZ was in need of my money Id gladly just give it to them if it means avoiding this nightmare. Oh, and the camera is set to fat..."
5,"Im a complete dive bar junkie. Whether Im in a big city, or small town I always seek out the local spots. I was in Tempe with work and we happened to drive into town right at last call so we searched for the closest bar which just happened to be Monkey Pants. After we got over laughing at the name and the paint job on their truck...we went in and were greeted by the waitress right away. It wasnt too busy especially for a Friday night but the place is huge! The bartender was very attentive and adorable.   I really wish I couldve made another stop at this bar before I went back home..I saw a bunch of posters for all these theme nights and great deals. Reading previous reviews it sounds like they have parties going on like this all the time. Great bar!"
5,"If you ever want to instantly ""up"" your cool factor with a friend or date, meet them at the Lost Leaf. The mere fact that there is no external sign (other than the tacky ""open"" sign indicating that it is, indeed, the lost leaf) you would probably never have any idea that the best neighborhood bar in Phoenix is inside. When i am asked to describe the lost leaf to someone who has never been before, it is basically a big open house with the most well-stocked beer fridge you have ever seen. No cocktails or draft, but for atmosphere and quality of beer selection, lost leaf is by far my favorite place to meet people in dtown phoenix."
1,"Considering what is considered the norm for workout facilities... this place is WAY behind the times. This place would be amazing for 1952- it would then be considered clean, tidy, and cutting edge. There are some actual perks about this place- they do have daycare and plenty of mirrors for me to watch my fat jiggle while I run on the treadmill ;) Its just an utter disaster. When the BF and I originally signed up, we got a couples membership at a newly redone Glendale location and it was worth the monthly membership fee. This place does not need a face-lift. It needs to be gutted and TOTALLY renovated. You just feel a nasty moistness when you walk in the door- which just gets worse the longer youre there... and is even MORE WORSE during the summer. Guys always have the weight benches dominated. Theres never any availability for machines (any kind) from 4-7:30pm, then it starts to thin out. Blah bla bla blah bla. Considering this is the ""Biltmore"" location... huge disappointment. Fact."
5,"Well what can I say about this place?  The restaurant is located in an upscale commercial complex with boutiques and an AJs in the middle of Arrowhead Ranch.  Definitely doesnt have the boring suburban feel which you get along Bell Road only a mile away.  The inside has exposed brick on the walls with sleek looking seating.  Each food item comes out looking like a self made creation from the chef.  I have to say the Marguerite pizza is one of my favorites.  Having a crispy crust and savory flavors that make my mouth want to eat more, more, and more.  But I dont need to eat more because I fill my mouth with a good wine.  I had  a Dutton Estate Chardonnay(I think) which was half off on this day which kept me happy.  This place did not fail me. So will I be back?  Umm thats a yes!"
5,"I am so grateful to say I have had the famous Rocket Burger.  This place gets so much Yelp praise and for great reason.   The soda selection is off the hook every soda you grew up with and then some all in coolers in bottles the even got YooHoo. Fries are all natural cut and amazing there is just something great about fries with the skin on them they just taste better.  The burger was Phenomenal I had the Santa Fe which had the amazing Rocket Sauce, bacon, and fried green chili.  It was outta this world good.   I will be a loyal customer and I am sure will post numerous updates to this review cause this place is just that good."
5,"This is a great little hidden gem! From the outside, it looks like just a dive but the inside is surprisingly nice.  The food here is great and they are willing to make things to your taste when it comes to ingredients and spice level.  The waitstaff are also very friendly. They came by while we were eating just to make sure we were happy with everything even though this is an ""order at the counter"" place. Another little bonus is that they have a drink station where guests can help themselves to free refills which definitely comes in handy in Phoenix!"
2,"Id love to give these guys a better review, because they were very friendly and professional.  However, I was very dissapointed with the service I received.  Ill type the one sarcastic comment that I cant get out of my head and then Ill get to the more substantial feedback.  I thought a detail was supposed to be a little more DETAILED. Here are the positives, because I want to give credit where credit is due.  The guys come to you and are very polite.  They were a little delayed, but called to let me know which I appreciated.  Also, they do a great job at steam cleaning the carpets and the exterior wax job was awesome. On to the negatives.  When I came out to see the work they did, I immediately noticed several smudges in the interior which they cleaned after I pointed them out.  Also, I noticed a scratch on the passenger side leather seat and a hole punched in the carpet near the pedals.  Anyone who knows me knows that I am a DETAIL oriented person.  Those defects were not present in my car prior to this job.  To add to this bit of a let-down, a day later my boyfriend and I noticed that they didnt even touch my trunk!  They didnt even bother to vacuum it out! When you advertise on your website ""showroom quality,"" I expect showroom quality.  Overall review: good job on the exterior, attention to detail in the interior was very poor.  I am really dissapointed that the attention to detail just wasnt there.  I was expecting so much more from a detail job."
4,I never tire of a deliciously hot bowl of Pho from this place. This service is efficient and the food tastes so very fresh. The veggie pho is my favorite along with the soft appetizer spring rolls. My son usually gets the beef pho or one of the fried rice dishes and we have never been disappointed. Good lunch crowd every single day of the week. Yummy.
4,"Pats is predictable. In the retarded amount of times that I have eaten there, ive never been served pizza im unhappy with. Best pizza slices in Arizona with good prices. Generally stopping by for slices is the easiest way to find good service with little to no wait.  Not always the friendliest workers, but that doesnt make my pizza take longer or taste any different!"
3,Lunch here is delicious and well worth it.  Dinner?  Spend your hard-earned money elsewhere.  If its easy-earned money and you dont care to spend then by all means enjoy the authentic atmosphere and above average French food... just dont order the flat iron steak.
1,"The beach paradise of Ixtapa-Zihuatenejo awaited us....unfortunately, so did a connecting flight in ARIZONA of all places... Long story short....1/3 of our luggage did not arrive at our final destination, various articles of our clothing are still missing as well as my cell phone charger...not to mention security forcing us to open sealed containers of my sons baby food and milk for litmus tests... I looked on the bright side....at least we didnt get deported =)"
4,"Used a Groupon here, and it was a great experience! The express mani/pedi wasnt express at all - they took their time with me, and everything felt great! The woman who did my pedicure was fantastic. My toes and feet look wonderful! The woman who did my manicure was pretty good. The only issue is that she accidentally cut my thumb. When it bled a little, she just painted over it. Its now been a few days, and my thumb still hurts.  Overall, it was a good experience though, and the staff was very friendly! I would return for sure."
5,"Im ashamed that I havent left a review for this place yet. Ive eaten here for a good while and Ive never been disappointed with the food. Well, there was this one time, but it was because it was sold out. Im okay with that, it tells me it was really popular that night. Anyway... The prices are good, the teas are good, and its just fun to sit in the pews while watching the candles melt. Every friend Ive brought here has had a good time with an equally good meal. Im a sucker for the royale with cheese and a side of thousand island. You know what, look at the average review score. I really think thats the most telling part of this place. Really. Go. Eat. Enjoy."
2,"Sorely disappointed.   I used to be a fan, but this barely half-full(at high noon on a Monday!) restaurant just doesnt cut it anymore.  Wait staff was sub-par, food was average, and the prices still conveyed the idea that the management thought they were awesome. Parking is a royal pain in the butt -- and has clearly had an effect on other nearby businesses.  (This part is no fault of Unos as far as I know). If given a choice for a tasty business lunch, look elsewhere."
1,"Just had Daphnes for the last time. In the 3 times that we have ordered from them, they cannot seem to get a simple order right. One Kids Burger with Apple Slices (Nope) one side of hummus(Nope) But they are quick to charge you for the order. Then you call and talk to a girl name Liz and she begins to tell you that they are correct and you the customer are wrong. Even though I have all the food sitting in front of me nope still no kids burger or side of hummus. HMMMMM,.. keep letting her answer the phone and you will see your to go customer base decline. We are an office in Scottsdale that everyday is ordering lunch for the office, Daphnes has officially been removed from the menu book. Nice customer service!!!!!!"
5,"When I get the urge to eat out, Im normally drawn to more laid back restaurants where I can sit back, chat, and enjoy my meal.  With a relaxing atmosphere and fun menu (Chicken & Waffles, and Smores for dessert), I definitely enjoyed this place.  My first time here was for a Yelp event so I was able to try just about everything.  My favorites would have to be the mac & cheese and the beef brisket--both delicious!  Id say theyve got their BBQ technique mastered, at least where the brisket is concerned.  And the cornbread is probably the best Ive had--so happy they handed out the recipe at the event.  The service was great; everyone was friendly and very helpful.  I was satisfied with everything here and definitely would come back--and probably leave with tasty leftovers!"
4,"Persian food... marinated meats...mmmmmmmm Try the soltani - one skewer each of koobideh (ground beef) and barg (pieces of filet mignon). Along with the accompanying basmati rice, its an extremely satisfying meal. And if you want a different take on stews, try their ghormeh sabzi. Absolutely delicious! Their shirazi salad and humus make great starters.  I was introduced to this place 17 years ago by a girlfriend. Well, shes ancient history but, thankfully, Tasty Kabob isnt."
2,"So, this will not be my best review, especially when I expected so much more from this place. Lets get this out of the way and on the table first, this ws not a bad place to go, but, it wasnt my favorite by any means.  I went in expecting to pay a lot for the meal, and rightfully expected the best food I have ever had, and that was just NOT the case.  From the high prices to the limited menu, I would expect this place to specialize in the particular menu items, and would hope to have my taste buds dancing while I shout for more.  I didnt. We started the meal with burratta forno cotto mozzarella.  it consists of oven baked burrata mozzarella served with grilled ciabatta, fried eggplant, lemon-truffle vinaigrette and parsley.  There were only two tiny ciabatta slices which was not the first complaint.  the second complaint would be that the fried eggplant could have used a bit more flavor.  (perhaps a little lemon pepper in the batter would have done some good) Lastly, the dish could have satisfied by just having a bit more cheese.  This dish was not bad by any means, just expected a bit more with the $12 price of two miniature slices of ciabatta and two thinly sliced pieces of eggplant. on to the salad.  I dont know about you, but, when I order a salad, I expect a salad.  this was a salad, just not with any lettuce or salad look.  we ordered the caprese di pomodoro.  this dish is made with heirloom tomatoes, preserved lemon, herbs, fresh burrata mozzarella and extra virgin olive oil.  from the description, i assumed, dont ever assume, that this was going to have some spring mix as a salad base, then have the tomatoes witih cheese and basil, and then the lemon with olive oil as a dressing.  WRONG.  it was nothing more than what the description said.  it was two tomatoes cut in half, with a small amount of cheese and a few basil leaves and then the lemon preserve mixed with the olive oil on top.  dont get me wrong, this ws absolutely AMAZING, and I would love to have it again.  It is just not what I expected, so, it would have been nice to know what exactly I was ordering for $10. To make matters worse, our so called salad took about 30 minutes to make its way to the table after putting in the order.  it took so long that the chef actually apologized and told management that he was going to send out a soup for us for the wait.  we were fine and in no rush, but, when we were already having our food take forever and told we were going to get soup, we expected it.  the soup never came. finally, after waiting for and hour and a half for our main entree, we got our food.  it was good, but, nothing to write home about.  my pollo portofino was bland to say the least, and was actually a little dry.  the potatoes were decent, but again, a bit bland. my date got the ravioli di mozzarella con salsa allarrabbiata.  the ravioli pasta was so thick that you really couldnt taste the filling, and the sauce was to sweet in my and my dates opinion. we however did order a side of the risotto parmigiano, and this was just amazing.  I am very happy that the recipe was on a poast card that came with the bill.  I will be making this at home in the coming week. for dessert, we ordered pistachio gelato.  it was the best gelato I have ever had. when it comes to a decision of returning to Alto, it will not be high on my list due to being over priced for what you get and all around, just not the best first experience.  I will however think of stopping in to get some risotto or gelato to go. when it comes to good Italian, I think I will be sticking with Italian Gratto or Pane e Vino."
3,Good to know they still have independent films and they chose wisely what to play. Unfortunately this location seems to be attracting 40+ yuppies! I was shocked to see how many middle-aged and even elderly were at Camelview. That was a disappointment :/
4,"Having just returned from a whirlwind overseas business trip, Condor had to unwind. No place better than the Spa at Camelback Inn. It has been years since Condor visited and, as I expected, they did not recall that on my last visit I mistakenly thought the terrycloth robe and slippers were a gift.  The letters demanding their return stopped after 3 months. Arriving in the lobby I was greeted by the soothing sound of Asian Zen music and the tranquil flow of fountain water. After a quick flashback to the three days in a jungle hut cell due to a jade sale gone bad, I headed to the luxurious locker, donned the fluffy terrycloth robe and settled poolside.  My first disappointment of not having a drink in hand almost immediately was soothed when staff opened the bar 2 hours early. Talk about customer service at 7:30 in the morning. Having the secluded pool to myself, literally, I settled in to a literary vacation of the mind. It had been a long time since I read ""US Weekly"".  Engrossed in the torrid life experiences of the hoi polli, I hardly noticed Companion had arrived and asked why I had already consumed six umbrella laden cocktails. ""The heat,"" I responded. ""Its 75 degrees,"" Companion stated with the accuracy of a former weekend weather girl in San Diego.  Well, more cocktails ensued, including Companions Mango Margarita, whose orange color I compared to the stunning, skin tight dress worn by an unknown actress named ""Roxie"" at a Red Carpet Event in the pages of ""US Weekly"". The color of the Mango Margarita complimented  the snow white of my robe after it was hurled in my direction.  Another drink soothed Companions ire and it was time for the highlight of the day: our individual Swedish Massages! Escorted by my Massage Therapist, the spitting image of Peta Wilson (Google it.) I was soon transported into a realm of relaxation and bliss. The bad news came when I was awaken from my trance by a knock on the door. It seems my snoring had disturbed the guests next door and my session was cut short.  No matter, more poolside time with Companion awaited and more frothy cocktails. Unfortunately, upon return to my chaise lounge, I was greeted with a note. Apparently Companion and her Male Masseur hit it off and were enjoying cocktails at the Valley Ho Hotel down the street. I was definitely not invited.  Well, upon reflection, the facility, service, therapist and massage were excellent. Although romance did not blossom, I did add another terrycloth robe to my closet, albeit with a Mango Margarita stain."
4,"Stumbled into this place while vacationing in Scottsdale for Spring Training. I was suffering from one of those hangovers that makes you feel your pulse in your dome. My buddy(who was campaigning for breakfast at Taco Bell..who does that?) was driving like a kamikaze pilot and responded to the vehicle full of people pointing towards Paradise and grunting uggghhh. While walking up to the door an odd brown dribble stain was pointing us towards the entrance. Didnt know what to make of this. Also wasnt sure if it was from my friends who had plodded in ahead of me. Once entering this fine establishment my not-so-working-correct brain couldnt comprehend the two different counters. Also confusing was the two menus. Being told what was going on by a nice gal behind the counter didnt help much since English was definitely my second language at this point in time. After just pointing at what I needed I was ushered along to the cash register. I got my number sat with my group and waited.....and waited......and waited. As more time passed I began to ponder what the actual construction and building time for a croissant sandwich was. Also helping was my wife reminding me of every person that got there food ahead of me. We were asked how are food was a couple of times so I figure they could sense my frustration as to not having it. Then my glorious croissant sandwich was brought to me. It tasted absolutely magnificent. I could have died right then and been happy. To make up for this delay the manager brought us THREE boxes of cookies. I didnt catch her name, but damn if she didnt pass customer relations 101. Tossing me a free OJ wouldve been sufficient, but to give this wild pack of drunken animals munchies for the weekend went above and beyond. I will definitely crawl back in the next time I visit Scottsdale."
2,"I wanted to love this place so bad considering Ive lived in Venezuela and hadnt tasted some of this countrys food in over 17 years.  However it pains me to write that I was pretty disappointed.  The server, who is assume owned the restaurant, is a very nice guy but forgot my stepsons food and didnt realize until 15 mins after he dropped off our food.  My cachapa was burnt and dripping with butter.  Dont get me wrong, cachapas usually are rockin with butter but this was oozing everywhere.  The arepa was pretty decent and the only saving light of the meal but overall this experience left me wanting more."
3,"Not bad, but definitely not my first choice. If I were to eat pizza in the restaurant, then this is a good choice. But there are better choices for take-home pizza."
4,"I actually love the Waterfront Grill. I have never been there during bar hours, so it might not be a good later in the evening, but I usually go around 5-7 for dinner and the food has always been excellent. I usually get the buffalo chicken wrap, but sometimes I go with the fish tacos. Both are excellent and the service is great (because usually my and my friend are the only ones in there - I often wonders how it stays open). The cookie desert is awesome! It is like the Piezooki and Oreganos. Just as good."
3,"Love this Cold Stone if only for the fact that around the time you would be leaving dinner in one of the close restaurants, the strip mall this location is in is basically shut down. We didnt have any wait whatsoever."
3,"Inexpensive for the early bird special.  $5.55 for the combination plates that include egg roll, soup, rice, and your selection.  If the food only had more seasoning or flavor?  It was very bland and flavorless.  I usually do not use soy sauce, but needed to use it to add something to my dish.   Neat features: Koi pond inside with a bridge over it."
4,"Oh good another Paradise Location for meeting up with friends after work. Clean neat and well manned , the worker bees seemed in real force, cleaning refilling and picking up plates. Nice to see.  Food wasnt quite paradise but it was tasty and filling . I usually have the panini with chicken and artichoke but today went for a Chicken wrap.Tasted like a chicken wrap.  The peach decaf teas was refreshing and the mango tea was too.  I love the casualness of the setting and the ease with which you can order at your leisure . If you are meeting people with different time constraints , this can be very helpful."
2,"Heard a lot of good things about Petes. I am from the Gulf Coast and was not expecting to find anything that would compare to the delicious fried seafood of back home. Glad I set my expectations low.   Petes fish is ok, square, almost like processed but not. Strange but tasty. Chips are decent, taste like typical Ore-Ida frozen fries. The Onion rings were good (super greasy though). My biggest problem is that I am a bit of a traditionalist. If you are gonna call it ""fish and chips"" like they would in the UK, then you have to at least have malt vinegar. The red sauce is good with their fries and rings (and maybe shrimp) but not on fish. It is the only sauce they have. I hear the burgers are good and may go back, if I am already in the area, to try one. I wonder if they have mustard? They may be trying to do too many things at once here. Seafood, Americana, Mexican, (fish, shrimp, burritos, hot dogs, chicken, oysters) Just a thought.   The seating is outside, if its summer you must get it to go. Between the heat, pigeons and huge flies (serious kitchen hawks) you will not have a good time.    The prices are very reasonable but they only accept cash. I would not go out of my way to eat at Petes again."
4,"Take someone that matters here and you wont be sorry. The service is some of the best in the world, and the food is stunning. The menu changes once or twice a year, and if you cant wrangle this place on an expense account, it is THE place to impress a client. Destined for a Michelin star...."
4,"The Fries Need Work! I have been here several times now and the fries have been a disappointment . They are not the crispy fluffy potatoey goodness that Belgian fries are supposed to be. Having said that, everything else from the brats to the beer to the service is worth the trip. The outside patio is like being at a German Biergarten without all the kitch. Check it out!"
4,"During the work week I have to eat out for lunch quite a bit and I get tired of paying 10+ for lunch. I remembered hearing something about Boston Market having a $5 lunch special so I figured I would go check it out... Finally there is a place that has good, somewhat healthy and well priced lunches! Your choice of carver sandwich with soup/salad and a drink, they have soup and salad and I cant remember the others but it was a pretty nice selection.  You pay more at McDonalds for a combo and this is way better! If you are out and about for lunch I would highly recommend going here. Im sure most people have eaten here before so the food wont be a big surprise but the price is GREAT! This will definitely be a go to for me."
4,"Very good battered dipped fish, cole slaw bland, fries came barely warm. Service is fast for crowd, very nice and friendly staff. Ill go back for the fried cod. Did have to exchange coffee cup. It had some funk dried and stuck to the inside wall."
3,"The riped mango slices add an extra dimension to a traditional Papaya salad dish.  Typically traditional papaya salad (Lao original) is garlicky, lemony sour and pepper varied hot.  The way this dish was made lacked all of those 3 features but the sustitution by the ripe mangos solved that issue and gave it the flavor that it need. By design, I expected that was the intention of this Americanized dish: the individual ingredients thrown in separately and not blended in until it softened, stripped away the traditional spice and saucy elemental aspects of it and you  have something different for a change that the mostly non-minority American diners would enjoy. The papaya salad is usually regarded as an appetizer; a feminine dish usually made by a female(it is also blasphemous for a male cook to make it, and I dont want to know).  But this happened to be the best dish that I experienced at this place.  The others were pad thai and some chicken mix with brocolli. Both tasted very Americanized. The pad thai is reminescent of a take out of the ""Panda Place"", not bad but not special. Overall, by design -Americanized Thai, that attempts to tone done the flavors of the dish and the way ingredients are prepared , it creates a different twist on traditional dishes.  It had to because , for example, you cant throw preserve fish sauce into these dishes like you would in an authentic Thai restaurant that would fume the whole place. In my opinion, I wouldnt call this type of food a downgrade , maybe a ""Fusion"" and maybe its lost and thats unfortunate because it needs a direction standing of its own.  My group received attentive and high level of services and the ambience of the place is noteworthy; both these factors exceeded the food experience . Parking may be a walk since you are in old town Scottsdale. Based on individual preference , looking at the food alone, this would not be a place I would repeatedly come; it does not provide traditional flavors in the sense that Lao Thai or Thai Esan or Thai Hut does for the same price and nor does it expect one to follow traditional eating ettiquette that is an essence of food from this region. But it would be a place I take those who cant stomach the traditional flavors, I would have to eat a little before coming here."
3,"Michael C is right. This place is very charming. I love the inside decor, with brick walls. I love the ""No Sniveling"" sign hanging behind the bar. Its a small place, but thats part of the appeal. Theres a small upstairs patio, with a fireplace (wasnt on when I went) that could be a great spot to hang. Its not much of a view, but theres something cool about being at a higher elevation.  Finding J. Chew was a little bit of a challenge. We ended up stopping at AZ88 to ask for directions. LOL! When we arrived, my friend and I sashayed up to the bar. Immediately we had a drink menu in front of us. I was more intrigued by the huge crystal ball-esque 20 Questions game. I wanted to play! When I asked about beer, the tender motioned to the shelf above his head. Ahh... Not a great selection, but itll do. I went with the Honey Brown. $4.50. Great price. Okay beer. Ill order something else next time, if I can make up my mind. Stella? Fat Tire? Hmm...  The whole reason for venturing to J. Chew was for a celebration. My friend was getting married, and this was her final Saturday night as a ""single."" So, the group of women sat outside on the small patio area. It was a cold, chilly May evening and they had the fireplace going. They also had a couple heat lamps working, but most of them were out of propane. Bummer. We Phoenix Dwellers were shivering our coconuts off, if you know what I mean. (Praise Allah for fingerless gloves, which were a big hit that night.) But, the bartender did try and keep them going, so we appreciated his efforts! Overall, I like J Chew. Yet I cant rate it higher than 3.5 for a few reasons. Yes, one is the beer selection. While its small, its also doable. Yet, their mixed martini list looked disgusting. Then again, I dont do martinis. Nor do I throw down $11 on a mixed drink.  But the real annoyance came from other patrons. From one guy in a hockey jersey throwing himself against the glass door (even hitting his head on the glass, when prompted) to a crazy DBacks fan yelling in the face of a calm Braves supporter, those couple of guys just totally zapped the cool, calm and collected from J. Chew & Co. Theres something defeating and sad about seeing another man yell ""Lock it up!"" at another man, during what could be a calm, mature discussion about two sports teams they individually love and follow. Theres something even sadder about watching an aging man with a cigar hit on a married woman. He just wouldnt leave our group alone. Oh well...Maybe they wont be there when I go back... because I think if they are, Im gonna have to say something. How obnoxious.  If youre in Old Town and looking for a chill spot to hang, this is your place. Plus, I liked the music they had on rotation... From Modest Mouse and Postal Service to 90s grunge and alternative rock, I was diggin the tunes, along with the laid back atmosphere, the great service and the knowledge that there was a chill place in Snottsdale to hang. Who knew?! I just dont think theres a strong enough draw to hang at this place all night. This is more of your ""before dinner"" or ""before another bar"" type of estabilshment. Only problem is theres not many other cool places in the area Id be interested in going, especially on a Saturday night when Snottsdale is out in full force."
5,Best prices and a huge selection. I love their single bottles of beer isle where you can mix and match your own 6-pack of beer. Some of my favorite beers I can only find here.
5,"I love boba drinks but hate the word ""boba"". I always feel like an ape when I say that word.    Anyways. There was a period where I use to drink this stuff at least 3 times a week when I was living in San Francisco, so when I say I love something, I really do (or is it more like a creepy obsession?) So! When I found a boba place here I got excited, especially when I saw that they had green milk tea. I cant vouch for all of their drinks, as Ive only tried the green milk tea and avocado snow, but every time I have ordered them they have been super good."
2,"REI.. I love you .. what and who did you hire??!!! BECAUSE you are such a 5star.. you rock.. you have all things for the active.. even for my active doggy! My active everything.. BUT when I drop over $100 on a reflective North Face jacket so Mark doesnt get run over on the run in the dark on his business trips.. & your startofffriendly and turntobeastwhentoldNO workerbee clerk boy checks me out and I deny his REI loyalty club membership.. not once.. not twice.. he asks whats my DEAL? Wait, DID he just ask me whats my DEAL??? (come here college boy.. ILL show you what my deal is!) followed with.. what you dont see yourself shopping here much? I glared at him.. and stated I was in an absolute hurry.. PLEASE give me my paid for merchandise because I SAID NO! My friend said thank you as we left.. and he actually chuckled.. umm no thank you back.. bad bad bad.. but I love the merchandise and the friendly folks in the bike and running area.. so its gotta rate a 2 for that.."
5,"I see a lot of four stars...perhaps Im too generous with my five stars. Im a giver. Attended a party for Georgie on Friday night and had a great time.  Easy to find, easy to park, easy to get a drink.  Plus- HEY they have the same turbo nozzle a/c vents that I have in my home. I could live there. Exposed brick? Me too! Felt right at home. I love the way they display their art, Im assuming from local artists.  I would prefer to not have to walk down a flight of stairs after a night of drinking. However, no problems there - thankfully. :)"
4,"I consistently enjoy Chelseas Kitchen, even in uncomfortable circumstances (long story). This last time was no exception. We started with ""white"" sangria, which none of us had heard of before, despite prior visits. The ""white"" is a pinot grigio so it was an easy decision to order the pitcher. The sangria was delightful - we didnt quite finish the wine, but the pitcher-ful of fruit was polished off. My swordfish tacos were delicious and filling. My friends fried chicken (a special) was good but a bit dry. I suggested gelato after dinner; no one had room. Service was a bit inattentive. The table seated after us received menus, waters and had their order taken before we had a server approach the table. After the first server, another seemed to take over and things got better. The atmosphere at Chelseas is good, as others have pointed out. Its a great place to hang out. The setting is beautiful. I will return."
4,"The food and cocktails at this place are amazing - beyond comparison. I have not eaten one bad thing off of their menu. I am not a margarita person AT ALL but my friend insisted I try their primarita (essentially a skinny margarita) and it was amazing. Probably what all margaritas are supposed to taste like. I crave them. Their guacamole is phenomenal - fresh and made right in front of you to your taste. You really cant get any better without going to Mexico and eating at at a mom and pop restaurant. The pork shoulder is great and the skirt steak is to die for. This is also a great brunch spot - the green chile chilaquiles are outstanding.  They are on the pricey end but their entrees are shareable. I love the dark, candlelit ambience. Perfect for pretty much any occasion: date night or bachelorette party.  Cautions: it seems next to impossible to get a weekend dinner reservation between 6pm and 9:30pm. I dont know if these are blocked out by default on Open Table. Your best bet is to make your reservation well in advance and call them directly. I have never been to this place as a walk-in for dinner. Service has also been hit or miss. I seem to get an excellent server or a really bad one."
5,"This is the pub burger you have been looking for. Nothing fancy, just a good solid burger with a ice cold beer. Be aware this is cash only, but unless you fall in you wont need much."
4,"Went there for my birthday ....  Another quality insured restaurant, it is inside of Four Seasons, it cannot go wrong ....  The restaurant is very classy with a nice and upscale environment .... and most of all with a very nice view to the phoenix area  The service is definitely top-notch and food was excellence as well. Had the sea bass and the filet mignon .... both were yummy .... and customized birthday desert as well ....  Will go back for a visit for sure ...  Also if you are in Talavera, dont forget to grab a drink in the patio as well .... they have live music and watching the birds flying around the mountain (the resort is built into the mountain) was quite a view"
4,"This is definitely the best place for breakfast in Wickenburg.  Loved all the cowboy decorations, photos of actors from the early Westerns days, and the ""cuckoo"" clock which didnt cuckoo but instead whinnied like a horse.  Clean premises, very friendly staff, excellent service, and breakfast for the group came out in due time. Call ahead for groups of more than 4, as most of the booths are small."
3,"Good Chinese food, great value -- especially for lunch.  China Village is one of my regular haunts for Chinese food when Im in the neighborhood.  The building may look run-down, but the food and service are good."
5,"Love this place! I went with my Grandma and Aunt on a Thursday afternoon. The weather was great but just a tad windy so we sat inside. First I like the layout of this place, very open and airy. There are 2 outside patios one street level and then one upstairs. I actually have been here twice so far. First time was just for a mid afternoon cocktail with one of my stylists. The servers were very friendly and our concoction of vodka, grapefruit and cranberry juice was the perfect blend.  The second time we ordered 3 small plates to share, ahi tacos, artichoke and spinach dip and the mussels. All three were heavenly and very reasonably priced. The ahi was fresh and chilled, perfect for a warm day. The artichoke dip was different than any I have had before, gooey cheesy goodness that we gobbled up practically licking the bowl. The chips that accompanied the did were fresh and perfectly salted, even when the dip was done we still polished off the chips. The mussels were in a perfect white wine sauce but the stars of this dish were the mussels themselves. Buttery and melt in your mouth good, not chewy at all with no grit, to most common problem I find. The broth was so good I let the bread marinate at the bottom of the bowl, soaking up the juice. My martini was a generous pour and even though they were out of blue cheese stuff olives the bartender took the time to stuff some and deliver it to our table.  Now on to the staff, all are a good looking lot but they are also skilled. All of our food and drinks were delivered in a timely manner by our lovely server Jennifer. We also met one of the sous chefs, Lennie. A charming fellow with stunning blue eyes, my grandmother remarked on them, a playful Mohawk and tattoos peaking out of his uniform. He swears that the sweet potato fries are some of the best in town and sent over a complimentary bucket. I do believe he is right, cooked to perfection, slightly crisp on the outside, warm and soft on the inside dusted with fresh herbs and I believe Parmesan cheese. After our meal the manager came over to make sure everything was to our liking.  RnR is another great place within walking distance from my salon and I am looking forward to trying everything on their menu. If all the items are as wonderful as the first 3 I tried I am in for a treat!"
3,"mid-afternoon is definitely different than dinner. still tasted good. we usually get the layered dip, its totally messy and not as good as i think it should be, but i like it anyhow. i get the durango burro and matt gets some combo monstrosity. service is...meh, average. queso is tasty."
5,"Why did I wait so long to try this neighborhood hot spot!  Having a father who grew up on Los Olivos I remained a loyal customer, that is, until last evenings change in plans lured me to the colorfully lit and lively patio of Los Sombreros Authentic Mexican Cafe & Cantina.  I am not an expert on ""authentic"" Mexican cuisine nor will I pretend to know what  the flavors of San Miguel de Allende taste like; however, I am a foodie so I know good food when I eat it.   We chose to sit outdoor and enjoy the beautiful weather while taking in another Cardinals loss!  (Sad, I know, since they were off to a great start)....  Lucky for us it was a calm Monday night and we had the full attention of our waiter, aka the bartender.  Phil (no need to blush if you read this) did a wonderful job walking us through their many margarita selections while also conveying his personal favorites that showcased his love for whiskey!  My friend allowed Phil to make his margarita as he felt a fine margarita should be made while I allowed Phil to concoct my special margarita while following strict no sugar, no salt, heavy on the tequila preferences...and that was just to start!  Perfectly crafted margaritas in hand, check.  Now what to eat for dinner.   My friend ordered his beloved Mole poblano ($18.95) while I couldnt decide between the Smoked chicken enchiladas with salsa verde and chipotle crema (yumm) and the Pollo a la parilla with spinach in a chipotle cream sauce -or- tinga Poblana sauce($18.95).  I opted for the Pollo a la parilla with chipotle cream preparation and, once again, my dinner friend had order envy!!  Thats not to say his Mole was par (or dare I say sub-par) because it wasnt - it actually has received many culinary awards being named ""Best Mole"" both locally and nationally, but because the chipotle cream sauce combined with spinach, perfectly sautéed  chicken breasts and a side of warm corn tortilla is....AMAZZZZZZING!!!!  Its also fair that I note aside from the pricier entree dishes served w two sides (as we ordered), they also offer up tacos (3 at $10.95), various quesadillas (@ $5.95) and other lesser priced authentic eats including fresh guacamole, salads and more!   Deciding Id save room to see if they could satisfy my sweet tooth I boxed my remaining dinner as we read through each and every dessert.  Undecided, again, and so we trusted our gastronomy guide, Phil, to choose.  He selected the Mexican Chocolate Cream Pie to finish off the evening, and we happily finished off this delectable treat leaving one bite as I always like to do!!!    Thank you, Phil and Los Sombreros, for the memorable dining experience.  The food was outstanding, margaritas made by Phil are the best, and the patio alone is enough to draw me back for HH or even a late night dessert.  Thank you for staying in the neighborhood, Azucena Tovar, and congrats on almost turning 20 years old."
2,"I recently went to The Breakfast Club for the first time with a good friend who I hadnt seen in awhile. It was a weekday and so, while it was still busy, we didnt have to wait to be seated. The food was good, but slightly over-priced. My biggest problem with the restaurant - the service. They were slow to deliver our drinks and food, yet once our food came, they were swarming around like bees every five minutes to take our plates so we could get out of there. I felt like they didnt care at all for the fact that I was having a nice morning with a good friend but instead wanted us to pay and leave. After we had been there for just over an hour and fifteen minutes, out waitress actually told us to leave the table and finish our conversation outside so they could seat other customers. We were mortified. I have NEVER been asked to leave a restaurant in my life. Needless to say, they didnt win a loyal customer with me."
4,My hubby and I go almost ever Friday for happy hour. We love the chicken nachos! Its also one of the few places that has kept Blue Moon on draft instead of switching to Shock Top (a bonus for my husband). They recently expanded their wine list to my delight and Ive been having fun giving the new vino a try. The staff and manager are consistently friendly and the food is consistently good! Try the BBQ chicken pizza or the steak salad! Yum!
4,"Ok, yes I am writing a review for a fast food restaurant. I realize that seems a bit strange and quite possibly extremely unnecessary. I mean, fast food is fast food right? Everyone knows what their getting into and what kind of food to expect, right? While this is true I felt it was worth writing a little snippet for the always refreshing Chick-Fil-A. Its nice to have a fast food experience where the food tastes fresh and actually like real chicken. The nuggets are yummy, flavorful but not overbreaded. My parents enjoyed their chicken sandwiches and agreed that the food is fresh tasting and not too heavy. We also enjoyed the sweet tea which is a classic Chick-fil-A staple. One important thing to note was that this location was super busy when we walked in right at noon but soon after we ordered our food was ready in a flash. And for those of you who have never been to CFA before? The icing on the cake is the wonderful assortment of dipping sauces to suit whatever flavor mood you are in at the moment. Or you can do what I do and open one of each and dip to your hearts desire. Who doesnt love variety?!"
5,Best Ice cream sandwhich I have ever had
5,"I cant add much to what has already been said....BUT Ill try, haha! Um, dont come here without a map, or some sort of gps device (NOTE: some spots in the mountain do not get good reception, so a map on your phone may not always fully come in). It is VERY easy to get lost! There are many trails, I look forward to getting to know them better. So far, all I have really done is Mormon Trail and the Hidden Valley Loop.....Fat Mans pass is probably my most favorite spot...OH! AND there are some really cool rock formations on the way there (including a natural tunnel) look for the rock that looks like a big mushroom! This is a good area to do a hike in the dark....but dont do it until youve done the trail a couple times in daylight. You can see what seems like the whole valley from up there! If you do the night hike, make sure the moon is full.....you can actually see pretty well with that and the city lights. Plus, its GORGEOUS! (if you did mormon trail at night, you could start about an hour before sunset, then head back as the sun goes down) Dont forget water, it is a moderate level hike.....and flashlights would be a good idea too, just in case :)"
5,"You like hotdogs?  Motor (thats me) says get in your Mommys oldsmobuick and get over to TEDS!  AND you sissys that like ""sonoran"" style dogs talking smack about Teds, go back to Tucson and eat your fru fru pineapple topped dogs with peanut butter.   This is old style, 4th of July chargrilled hotdogs and hamburgers.  Makes my mouth water.  Ok so visualize and taste this in your mind.  First the juicy hamburgers that have the hardwood charcoal taste that makes your mouth water.  The crispy ice berg lettuce, juicy tomato and onion make this a purist burger lovers dream.  Real good home made taste.   So now act you like you always do on the 4th of July and get an all beef hotdog.  First a warning.  You will crave their hotdogs after you eat em.  The crispy plump skin that cracks in your mouth and the taste is like when you were a kid and watching the fire works on the fourth.  Add the spicy brown mustard with their ketchup ""hot sauce"" and buddy you got yourself dilemma.  The dilemma you ask? Is do you order one more hotdog cause they are soooo goood!  Try the Italian for a spicy dog.  Dont start with me on the fries and onion rings.  Just make sure you wear your fat pants.  Motor out and going back for another dog."
2,"As far as the sandwiches go, the place is fine but just thought Id mention that if you are trying the broccoli-cheddar soup late in the day you may find it ""overcooked tasting"" bordering on acrid and burnt like we did. I guess they assume everyone is going to order a $5 footlong because pricing for six-inchers is not quickly established by looking at the overhead menu."
5,"Ive ordered pizza and wings three times and the have consistently created perfection, seriously."
4,"I have eaten here four or five times.  We always get the mussels to start, and they are always delicious and cooked just right.  The broth is great for dipping the bread in, although I could probably just use a straw.  The fish of the day was halibut.  It was very flavorful, but maybe just a tad overcooked.  The scallops were wonderful.  Great wine selection.  This place a lively atmosphere.  Not too noisy to hear across the table, but a good vibe.  The service was excellent."
3,"No way around it: this place is overpriced. From the menu prices to the plate-splitting charges to the extra ingredients to the sides. Food itself it good not great. Blue Burger confirmed to me that they use specials and happy hours when they first open to generate traffic, but take them away once they hit the critical mass they want. So dont get to hooked on anything you like about these places."
5,"Huge fan of Bikram yoga! Its a 90 minute, torturous-at-times, sweat-filled  workout but when you are done, you feel insanely amazing. The feeling continues throughout the day leaving you in complete zen....Road rage? Gone. Annoying food cravings? Zero. Jeans? Fitting awesome. You really must try it, it can completely change your body. There are a few places in the valley that offer Bikram, most of them exclusively rather than in combo with other methods of yoga. The Bikram Institute on Miller and Indian School is where I first tried it, and I like it the best so far. They offer classes throughout the day and later in the evening as well. Like other studios, this place offers first timers a week-long pass for around $20. What I really like about this studio is their instructors and the fact that they keep their room darkened throughout the entire practice. Ive have been going to another studio lately (for their first-time student deals) and their instructors bark out instructions non-stop plus they keep the lights on the whole time. So when youre staring up lying in your relaxed state, your eyes meet the glare of the fluorescent.  Ill very likely return here after Ive exhausted the new student deals at the studios around the valley. Yoga can be expensive!"
1,"Ugh.  My tip-off should have been the Guy Who Saw Me Reading The Menu and came outside to tell me the food was good.  But I was craving Chinese, I work near the COFCO center, and it was threatening to rain.  I scanned the menu, found Kung Pao chicken, and ordered up.  They told me 5 minutes, and they were accurate.  Price was reasonable.  Waiting area was comfortable and well-decorated.  Food was inedible.   I got the lunch special, which include soup, egg roll, entree and fortune cookie.  I couldnt eat any of it.  The soup (hot and sour) was way too sour.  I felt like I would get acid reflux if I ate it.  I couldnt order the fried rice, because it contains peas (Ive learned to ask...childhood trauma).  The rice was clotted together and difficult to eat.  The kung pao chicken contained a suspiciously generous amount of meat...so much so that I questioned whether it was actually chicken.  I watch too many movies.  The egg roll was just gross.  It seemed like the wad of mushy veggies was wrapped in biscuit dough before it was deep-fried.  The fortune cookie was stale, and the fortune was even lame.  I wouldve done better to get soaking wet and hit up Panda Express."
4,"Alice Cooperstown is owned by rocker Alice Cooper and is a pretty unique sports bar in downtown Phoenix. Cooperstown was also featured on Man vs. Food. The most unique item and the biggest draw on the menu is the ""Big Unit"" hot dog. This is by far the biggest hot dog that Ive ever seen and the reason that I went to Cooperstown. The Big Unit is a 1 pound, 22 inch long Vienna hot dog, on a baguette roll. You can choose any combination of 9 toppings for the Unit.  I went with cheese sauce, jalapenos, bacon, and tomato. The dog had a good taste to it and the bread was fresh. I loved the cheese sauce and bacon, but would probably go without the jalapenos next time. Surprisingly I was able to finish the entire dog, but had to really force the last four or five bites down. Ive never felt fuller in my life. Unique restaurant and menu along with good food gives Cooperstown 4 stars."
4,"Things Evolve over time, so has La Condesa, There now is a big fancy bar and a somewhat different menu. What really matters is that the flavor, ans salsas are still here. I had a burrito with Mahi Mahi in it, it came loaded with spinach, mushrooms, cheese and rice. The cheese was a bit much but was still great at 10.59 with tax it should be. What really mad it great was the salsas. Everything from a peanut salsa, to a strawberry to many of the classic favorites. I really enjoyed the roasted peepers and onions salsa. Yes the inside is small and the parking is suicidal when you leave, but if you need a flavor shot give this place a try."
5,"What to choose, what to choose. Such difficult decisions! Seriously, this normally isnt a problem. Dispite the fact that Im a libra, Im very decisive. Friends usually look to me to make all sorts of decisions ::diabolical laugh:: Still, this place consistently stumps me. Is it Tuesday? If yes, then Im definately getting the Pork Belly Tacos. Otherwise, Ill start with an order of Ceviche and Asado Salad. To drink Ill have Agua Fresca de Sabor. Yes, Im going to have an entre too, I mean Ive already broken my diet, might as well :D Ill have the Huevos Rancheros or 3 Carne Asada Tacos or the Verduras de Temporada or the Chilaquiles Verdes or the Carne Asada Torta. OMG, so many great options! Seriously, this normally isnt a problem. Oh well, I guess Ill just have to try everything. Next up, a euphoric food coma! Life is good."
5,"we only came across this place because an acquaintance recommended it to us. Ive lived up the street from this place for years and never knew it existed, its quite the hole in the wall and easy to pass by. The place was super clean and the owners did a wonderful job serving everyone in a timely manner and being super attentive. We felt so taken care of!! :)  I thought the prices were a little on the high side but when they brought out our meal all I could say was ""WHOAH!"". The portion sizes were CRAZY awesome and my hubby and I could have really split one entree and still had some leftover.  The food was fresh, the meat tender, the atmosphere pleasantly divine! 2 trips now and Im such a fan! :D"
4,"Sharp looking place modern meets old dinner, good food nice and simple breakfast menu. Staff could have been more friendly, but over all solid place will be back again!"
2,"Drinking + Arcade Games. This should be an obvious winner, right? Wrong. Oh, how wrong.  Eating here is like eating in a casino, only less classy and with worse food.  Beers are overpriced but absolutely necessary to make it through the event.  Those combo deals that include beers and a game card seem like a good idea, until its 45 minutes later, youre out of points, youre nowhere near drunk and youve already spent $40. If you go late, try not to get syphilis when you walk by San Felipes."
2,"Good lord.  I dont ask for much.  I ordered a slice of quiche and an iced coffee.  They didnt have to bake the quiche, just warm it up.  I waited 15 minutes and then went to the counter to ask for it.  The server looked confused and the Guy who took my order said he ""got lost.""  I heard the server apologize to at least three tables (but not to me).  She told one guy the toaster burned his cinnamon raisin bagel (the last one in the shop) and insisted repeatedly that SHE didnt burn it--it was the toasters fault.  Quiche was tasty, though.  The server said it was mushroom and spinach, so I had to wonder for a minute what the bright red things in my quiche were...then, I figured out it was mushroom and chard.  Coffee was ""eh.""  The floor looked dirty.  There was a paper towel in the toilet.  Ok, Im nit-picking now.  The place was moderately busy; the small private parking lot was full.  Fortunately, I was on my scooter, so I could squeeze into a non-parking space easily."
4,"While I dont like to hype places up (because really, how GOOD can any one place be) ...How good can one burger joint be over another, or how good can pizza be over another pizza place (when weighing the ones that are all generally Good in the Public Opinion).  Now the word around town is that The Grind is Sofa_King Great.  I will say about The Grind that when youre up for a Burger, this place hits the spot.  Ive been here once before August 2010 (dont remember what burger I had but recall it was good) and the other night I had the Peppercorn Burger and it was as good as it gets.  I was starving and really hadnt eaten all day and that helped add to how much this hit the spot, but make no mistake, it was really good and I do enjoy this place for the atmosphere, service, and quality of food.  My friends wife got one of those healthy wraps and she liked it a lot.  The sweet potato fries (we ordered the half sweet potato and half regular fries) and they were good. As for some other areas to review: The atmosphere is nice.  Its casual and not too dark and not too light inside.  (Thats how I like it).  Theres multiple flat panel TVs above the bar, so plenty of games on at any given time (Thats also how I like it).  The service is fine (although based on some other reviews people have been so so satisfied about the service.  Thats often going to be the case with most casual establishments - so sometimes its good, and sometimes not to our satisfaction).  Such is Life!  Anyway, back on track here, the Wait staff and Bar staff have been worth the 20% tip both times.  No complaints by me about this place, however I do see some 2 and 3 star ratings on here.   Where I will dock 1 star and sort of agree with Kristi D.  She mentioned the large photo of Sheriff Joe Arpaio on the wall (while I sense that Kristi doesnt care for Sheriff Joe, Im neutral about him), but I agree about all the oversized photos of notable names in town who have dined in The Grind.  Id much rather see real artwork or real photographs on the wall - and not photos of Sheriff Joe, Mark Grace (for those who dont know, hes a former baseball player), and the Mayor of Paradise Valley, all holding their burgers.  Who the hell cares about any of them and their burgers.  I think Id be more ok with having these photos above me, but they are HUGE enlargements and a bit overkill.  And they are for sale and the proceeds go to some cause.  Look, Im all for causes and shit, but I wouldnt spend my money on a 36 inch enlargement of these local ""notables"" holding a burger.  The whole concept is pretty stupid.  But hey, Im generally uptight and been doing photography 20+ years and probly am just hating on the fact that my photos are hanging on the wall.   Side Note:  For those who might have previously had ""Liked"" The Grind on Facebook but no longer have their page as a Like, its because they apparently had their group page hacked, so they had to start over.  I found this out when I Liked it the other day noticed there were only about 165 Likes, and certainly I knew this place was way more popular than that.  When I commented that, they commented back about it being hacked and starting the page over. http://www.facebook.com/thegrindarcadia"
4,"As I mentioned in my previous review, Maizies was my favorite spot with the first Urban Wine Walk.  So it makes perfect sense that if the UWW Returns, so do I.  Well, return to Maizies that is!  We started there this time and enjoyed all three wines they were tasting.  Their pizza and bruschetta bites were great.  And after we quickly inhaled the samples, we decided to get more food.   The menu is pretty huge and everything sounded and looked delicious.  Yes, we were eyeing everybody elses plate as well; the bar seats are good for that!  After ooh-ing and ah-ing over what we saw, we decided to split the spinach and artichoke dip that came with chips and pit bread.  It was great! The best part about Maizies is that they just seem to do things right.  Friendly, casual service so you feel like youre among friends.  All sorts of specials listed up on the boards so 1) you dont have to feel dumb asking and 2) you dont have to feel even dumber when you forget and have to ask again.  Beer of the month (always fun to try), 20% off beer or wine to-go (what is this, Vegas?), happy hour specials (you had me at ""daily""), the list goes on and on. Good food, great energy, small, cozy inside and an nice patio space too.  I have only been twice now, but have have fabulous experiences each time.  A few more times, and they win the fifth star, easy!!"
3,The employees here are really nice and I like the island feel. The food is pretty good and I like it because there arent many other places in town with Hawaiian food. I also like that you can get beer here.
4,I took my son who has been living in Sweden to Angels since he likes good beer.  And he was noy disappointed.  The price was right for the quality of the beer.  We also enjoyed the food I had the sweet potatoe tacos and the were great.  He loved that so many varieties of good beers were on tap.  Definitely going again especially if all three of my sons are home.   Good beer good food good people
4,"Fruity Pebbles! YAY! They dont have a sign up yet, but we were walking by and noticed they were open and there were happy people inside so they must be, oh yes it was true, giving away free frozen yogurt!  They were offering original (vanilla) and pomegranate flavors to choose from, I chose pomegranate. They have fruity pebbles as a topping which made me very happy, since that was my favorite cereal as a kid."
5,"Where else can you get fresh lemon grass, fresh pork uterus, and avocado ice cream?  Asian markets are the bomb, but Lee Lees is the BOMB DIGGETY since they have EVERYTHING.  Jamaican, Cuban, Vietnamese, Korean, Indian, Lebanese---you name it. If you love to cook (and I do, I really do!) you can seriously spend hours here.   ONE CAVEAT:  The seafood is fresher and better at 99 Ranch on 44th St. in Phoenix. Last week, they were giving a 10% discount off of your grocery bill and a free bottle of fish sauce or soy sauce.  If you spent over a certain amount, you got a big bag of rice. Go!  Now! And have lunch in the Vietnamese restaurant attached."
5,"I was a regular at Mias first location in Wrigleyville/Chicago. Scott (the original founder/chef and present owner) is the reason Mia Francesca is what it is. Not sure if us folks up here in Scottsdale know how lucky we are he landed on our door step. Food, service, vibe...if I could give it six stars I would."
5,"Absolutely beautiful grounds. Golf course, restaurants, shops, botanical gardens, tennis courts...its all beautiful. Definitely book a room here as opposed to the main section of the hotel - Im not exactly sure what the difference is, but it IS a different (and smaller) building. Our room itself was nice, but the view was what made it amazing. From the balcony, you can see the golf course, the mountain, desert views, cactus...everything. And the service was great. The only complaint is that when I booked my stay, I was told that each guest would be assigned an ""Ambassador"" who would help ensure a great stay, or whatever. But throughout my weekend, this supposed Ambassador was never mentioned and didnt show up. Not a big deal, but if youre going to promise that service, then you better deliver. Otherwise, great stay. I would highly recommend this hotel. Great for a relaxing weekend."
4,"Pleasantly surprised about the cleaniness of the location, the friendliness of the baristas and just the overall atmosphere. Reminds me of a small town cafe with the general coffee condiments centered for easy access. Drinks were made to order and have never failed to keep satisfied!  Just need to get a drive through and all will be perfecto!"
2,"I happened on this place because it was next to EL Brava, a Mexican place recommended by the USAirways in flight magazine as a place to try in an airport. Getting to ElBrava we found it was a fast food stand with very little seating so this is next door.  The menu was pretty limited. Service actually wasnt bad but, even though it wasnt busy, we waited a long, long time for our meal to get there.... something you dont expect in an airport. When the food got there it ok. I had a burger that was pricey and non memorable.  Next time Ill go to El Brava and pass by the 12th!"
4,"Very authentic Szechwan style restaurant.  On a average Sat evening, the restaurant is pack full of Chinese family.  The service has improved a bit recently.  The first opening months usually has very long wait. Szechwan restaurant style dishes tend to be spicy and salty on purpose.  Most dishes are medium spicy here.  So if you can take the average Mexican food, you should have no problem here.  Just ask for lots of ice water. If you dont eat very spicy, there are still many great noodle dishes and dumping dishes."
5,"I love Fuddruckers because I can put my own toppings on including gooey, melty fake cheese!  Also, they have frings (a combo of fries and onion rings).  Very tasty."
5,"As good as it gets.  We ate here for a birthday celebration and we were taken away by the great food and service (as usual).  We requested the V Lounge and were given a nice corner booth.  When we sat down there was a birthday card signed by the employees of the restaurant -- a very nice touch.  For appetizers, we had oysters and the (best) crab cakes (anywhere).  Steaks and seafood as our main courses paired well with the red cabernet wine.  Overall, just incredible.  Completely up to par with Eddie Vs standards -- comparing to Houston and Austin.  My mom forgot her sweater at the booth and a hostess ran out to give it to her.  We also got a follow-up phone call the next day asking how everything went.  For those special occasions or a fun happy hour, Eddie Vs never lets you down!  Also, their Bananas Foster is divine!  Save room for it or just stuff your face and go to the gym the next day -- delish!"
4,"If you love Korean food, you will not be disappointed! The hot tofu soups are so good and served piping hot with your choice of spiciness. Their galbi ribs and bulgogi are authentic and as good as it gets. My son loves their pork katsu, which is served with rice, salad, and potato salad; and the servings are huge! We are regulars and bring visiting family and friends frequently. Great place!"
5,"I bought the HomeRun offer for a bike tune up at Trailhead.  I have to say that I was surprised at the quality of the service they did to my Trek hybrid bike. I could definitely tell the bike was riding better, smoother, more efficient. They even re-installed my bike computer, threading the wire around the front right fork very neatly.  I definitely recommend this place. Oh, and the food is good, too!"
5,"The best breakfast place, bar none!  I love that it is a local, non-chain place and they do everything delicious!!  The french toast is to die for and the plain and simple (eggs, bacon, potatoes) is perfect!  My husband and I split these two dishes and it is plenty.  We always leave stuffed!!  Be sure to make reservations for a Sat or Sun morning breakfast, otherwise youll be waiting at least an hour!!"
4,"In all of my shopping adventures at The Rack, Ive found each day can be hit or miss. Some days they have very little selection of high quality clothing and other times Ive seen $700 high-end designer dresses marked down to $30. They key, Ive found, is to go on the days when their new merchandise arrives straight from Nordstrom.  I somehow got on the Nordstrom mailing list, which I dont mind because they send postcards with the dates of these fashion events when new shipments arrive. These are the dates when the best selection of designer clothing comes straight from Nordstrom. So, if you can make it a point to show up, youre bound to find what youre looking for at a bargain."
4,"Not too shabby. Decent drinks, cheese/meat plate was standard but good. The beet salad didnt have many beets on it.. more lettuce. I think we were wanting it to be all beets. The highlight of the whole dinner was the squishy bread that came with the cheese plate. Pizza was also good. Big negative was that all 4 pizzas were soggy in the center. Other than that, no complaints. The one with fruit on it was the best. The sausage was typical, but good, the margarita didnt seem to be a winner with the table, I thought it was good. I like that rubbery cheese thing though.. The one with seafood on it was my least favorite.The tiramisu with pine nut brittle was tasty, the chocolate cake was fine."
3,"Hello my fellow Arizonians..... My review gets 3 stars but I really should give it 2... I am being generous. I will start....as always, by saying I am the pickiest person I know and although food is a preference.... I know what I like!  We went on a Saturday around noon and it was packed!  There were several larger tables open but nothing to accomodate 2 people so being the outgoing person I am, I invited a couple people to join us so we could take a larger table. What a great way to meet people, and they were great tablemates! The food is good, I only have a couple CONS.... No low sodium soy sauce and most of the food is VERY salty! The selection is not great, no calamari or bbq pork and several other items I enjoy. The only dim sum restaurant I have experienced out here is C FU Gourmet,,, their selection is greater but their downfall is the food is usually cool to warm and the place has been steadily getting worse. (bummer) and the owner just doesnt seem to care. If you enjoy Dim Sum...I reccomend you give it a shot and see what you think. And until then............. Bon Appetite"
5,"Ive rented from Captain Ted many times, and even gone on one of his guided trips down the Salt River. He is helpful and very knowledgeable and I would highly recommend renting here."
5,Excellent Soutwest breakfast bowl.  Great service.  Very convenient to downtown hotels.
3,"Im somewhere in between three and four stars. And, I know there are Yelp ""Talk"" events taking place right this very second as I sit to type my review, and it is for this reason I appreciate what anonymity I have so I wont be egged as I walk out my door in the morning. And, it is possible that I expected something earth shattering within the vicinity of so much greatness (read: Pizzeria Bianco) First of all - I had to approach the bar for service, refills and a check. Granted there was one guy running the place at 3:30 in the afternoon, but my friends and I were three of five people at the entire property. They werent busy.  We sat out on the patio and watched all the folks across the walkway start to congregate outside Pizzeria Bianco in the rain. It was an unbelievable an hour and a half prior to opening, they have at least two seatings of Guests waiting in the rain - I swear theres got to be something addictive in that crust. I love Bianco, I do, but I am also (sometimes) very logical. Show up at 5 p.m., go find a great patio table at the Rose and Crown, or Bar Bianco and have some wine for a couple of hours prior to dinner - dont stand in the rain for an hour and a half! But, I digress...were discussing the Rose and the Crown. Okay. Cute, compartmentalized rooms, yes. Homey feel, yes. Good selection of beer, yes. Good wine, no. Well made cocktails, yes. Menu, eh, okay. Service, eh, poor to okay.  Patio seats, rocking good! The trees changing colors, yellow leaves everywhere, perfect. People watching, phenomenal. Fish and Chips, pretty good. The friends I shared the experience with, too good to be true!"
4,"This would most certainly be ""my"" coffee shop if I hadnt already established myself as a regular at another local shop. This brand-new, independent coffee shop has spent the money to look really nice (it even has a fountain inside!). But what money cant buy is community and unfortunately this shop doesnt seem to have much of that. Granted, building community takes time and/or energy. For their sake, I really really hope it works out in the long-run."
5,"Tried this place for the first time tonight, and was impressed with absolutely everything. Well-lit building in a decent location in the Arcadia area. I drove here from the Garfield neighborhood and it was well worth it. Juicy chicken and awesome cafeteria throwback crinkle fries, along with one of the best slices of toast Ive ever had. All three of these foods were still crispy when I got home, which almost never happens with fast food. I wish I had gotten the girls name who took care of me. She was cute as a button- very enthusiastic and happy to answer my questions. Ill be back here soon!"
1,"Hot Breakfast..........NOT, Again cold food when it supposed to be hot....people beware of this over price place and lack of care for the customer it seems that this is the way of doing business. *** Again a nice place to visit but DO NOT EAT HERE.*** And DO NOT CARE!"
4,"I would never have stopped at the Wy-Knot Cafe if it had not been for a friend mentioning it in a post on Facebook. I am glad I saw that post. There have been a number of restaurants in that location that have failed. Wy-Knot has opened the space up, made it dog friendly (it is named for their dog) and has a great menu. You order at the counter and then they bring the food out to you. The employees were all very friendly. The only down side was the lack of parking due to the other businesses sharing a lot. Also there were hardly any customers. Hopefully they will deliver menus to the houses in the neighborhood and maybe do some promotions on the neighborhood e-mail service so people will know what they have to offer. I would like to see them make it. They serve breakfast and lunch all day. They had a variety of choices and it was hard to decide on one. We split a BLT and a Chicken Salad Sandwich so we could try both. They come with a side of beet salad or salad of the day. The beet salad was very good. We both preferred the BLT but I am sure the Chicken Salad was more healthy and it was tasty as well. Give them a try, I think you will enjoy the Wy-Knot Cafe. I will be back."
5,"The new location is big, open, and a bit more like a dinner spot rather than a mish-mosh diner. But thats just aesthetics, I realize. The food is great. I had the pad thai and tried one of the duck dishes. Im not a huge fan of duck, but this was nice and tender and the sauce was amazing. Whatever sauce it had on it was composed of peppers, mushrooms and ground pork, if that helps you find it on the menu. The drunken dragon is also fabulous, and at $7 for lunch and $10 for dinner, Yuphas a steal. I just finished the other half of my pad thai a minute ago. Yum. I think its my favorite Thai in the greater campus area, but then I thought about it and, isnt most of the good food in the Phoenix area in the Tempe area? I think so.  Anyway, Yupha is one cool lady and you can tell theyre trying hard with this grand opening. A little ass-kissing is nice, but then again, places like these are for regulars, so I guess they dont have to be overly nice to me. Im just here to grub. EAT HERE. And ask for twice the spicy you would normally. The medium is not spicy and the thai hot is medium."
5,No need for a long review. Every In-N-Out I have ever been too has been amazing. Great Food Great Customer Service Love this place
5,"My wife and I went to Harris Dental for a few years when we lived in Scottsdale.  We moved out of town in 2009 but we have never forgotten the superb dental care that we received from Dr. Joe Harris (who had come highly recommended from our Austin, TX dentist as a person who keeps up wth dental research).  Nor have we forgotten the fabulous and uniformly cheerful staff.  So it wasnt really too surprising that we received a call from Harris Dental a few days ago - more than three years after we moved away - asking for permission to archive our dental x-rays and asking where they might send funds from a credit to our account.  Who does that?"
2,Went to this place with family for a birthday party and tried various items from the menu.  Wasnt impressed with the food and the quality of the items.  Ive had better and will not be back since there are better places to dine at in the valley.  Sorry for being kind of harsh but I am only being real.
4,"Great Korean Kalbi and other table top meats. rest of the dishes wasnt that impressive . Weekend could be really busy you might need to wait for a while to get your food. but weekdays pretty slow. If you like Korean BBQ, this is the best place in chandler ,gilbert area."
4,"Watched the Ignite Phoenix #7 viewing party here on Friday Night. Thanks for hosting.  Had a lovely Americano while I watched.  Great drinks and cool interior.  The other guests seems to be talking about their food as being very good.  This is a little out of my neighborhood so dont know how often I will be able to stop by, but if I am ever remotely close and need a little java, this is a great little spot."
4,"This place is absolutely delicious but youll want to stay away on Friday and Saturday nights. It gets packed and the service declines. My boyfriend and I went a couple of weeks ago and if the food wasnt so delicious, the service would have kept us from returning. Kind of like the soup nazi on Seinfeld; youll do whatever it takes to get what you want!"
3,Sometimes the downside of Yelp is that you read so many great reviews for a new restaurant and you garner these very high expectations. Thats what happened with St. Francis anyways. Our bartender was not friendly at all. The dessert was very good however! Hopefully next time the service will be better - sometimes you just catch people on an off night.
3,"Okay.. I loved this place so much when I visited last year that I planned my Besties birthday bash here in August this year. I flew in specifically for this event. There were 10 of us at 8pm. Called to put our name on the list a few hours before as instructed. They were so unorganized it was horrible. We didnt get seated until about 10 pm and by then 2 people had left because they were starving.. By the time we were seated our service finally came together and I have to say we LOVED the unique shots and had almost every one on the menu. As for the food. The Hamachi Popper was by far my favorite. The HUGE disappointment other than the horrible service in the first 2 hours, was the elimination of the PB & Jelly roll. It was the ENTIRE reason I chose this place and they no longer have it! WTF? Had I not had 10 shots I would have been furious. Management was gracious enough to take off a couple shots from our bill for the chaos we had endured. It was appreciated. All in all we had a good time even though it took  forever to get to that point."
4,"I stepped in for a quick lunch.  I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap w/ fresh fruit.  The location is cool, although I couldnt tell if they were actually open.  The food was tasty, the fruit was pretty good.  All in all, it fit the bill.  I wanted a quick, healthful, lunch and Thats a Wrap provided. I do wish they were open a bit later because I would love a wrap after a good night of drinking."
4,"Great prices, great food. The staff is very friendly... Ill definitely be coming back here for lunch on a more regular basis. I had the kung pao, and the portions were incredible for the $5 I paid.  Not mind blowing, but better than most Chinese places Ive been to in the Valley."
5,"AZ 88 is a great date location.  The atmosphere is excellent - always an artistic display, usually great music.  If my parents ever make it out here from Wisconsin, Im definitely taking them to AZ 88.  The view of the Scottsdale mall is really cool, and the proximity to a number of the ""old"" Old Town bars is really convenient.  The food is reasonably priced, with most sandwiches and dishes right around $10.  They have a good sized bar selection, with some really interesting imported beers.  I would absolutely recommend the AZ 88 sandwich if you enjoy buffalo sauce, and its really hard for me to not order the little crackers with onions and bacon on them (even despite disliking bacon!)."
4,"Ive come here too many times to count during my time at ASU.  Each time Ive frequented this place, Ive pretty much inhaled whatever sandwich I got.  I like the fact that you can customize your sandwich to order and I really like the fact that you get a little chocolate chip cookie for free with your order!  (Their jumbo cookies are pretty darn good too!)  Avoid this place during the lunch rush, as the queue can literally snake outside and around the building.  Prices may seem on the high side for ""just"" a sandwich, but the ingredients are fresh and the people behind the counter are generally cool.   Now....to work on using non-styrofoam cups....lets make this place even better and greener!"
5,Honey jalapeño chicken lollipops and sweet potato tots are probably some of the most delicious things ever.
4,"Oh Yogurtland.....why cant I resist your calling? I had to run an errand and saw this location next to a Fedex Office...perfect!  I dropped in and ordered: Double Cookies & Cream, Strawberry, and Cheesecake...topped with Peanuts, Captain Crunch, and Reeses Peanut Butter Cup for around $4.90. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Co4cQNWyAYv7Hw8jKcEKJg?select=VcouxvxQ0Sl310XRxn9HOg http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Co4cQNWyAYv7Hw8jKcEKJg?select=8xzd9ms7YvNaEAvn1irgsQ It was of course awesome!  The line was very short too....even though the weather was in the mid-90s....boy did I luck out! Return Factor - 100%"
2,"It pains me to write a negative review of PJ, but I just have to ...  I was so excited for the new location to open because my husband and I go to the Indian School location any time were down that way, and this is way closer to home. We were impressed by all the room up there! Not cramped like the other locations. Unfortunately, the food was not nearly as good! Both of our meals were not nearly as good as weve had before (at the other locations).  Also, our service was terrible. We asked another server if ours was new, but nope: Shed bee there since it opened a couple months ago. She forgot jalapeno our hummus appetizer (to their credit, they brought it out after our meal and gave it to us for free, but it was bland and not that good). She charged me for a side of tahini, even though it was supposed to come with my veggie burger, and she never refilled our drinks.  Overall, this was a very disappointing PJ experience. Ill try again one more time, but if it doesnt improve, I wont be going back to this North Valley location. :("
5,"Not only does this place get its ingredients directly from Italy, it makes a variety of flavors fresh, daily!  I got my first taste of gelato when I visited Rome Italy a few years back. Ive tried other gelato spots around the U.S, but nothing has caught my AMORE, or the authentic Italian flavor, more than Angel Sweet.  So far my favorite combo is the ""most popular"" Panna Cotta with Banana, (which an employee recommended), Hazelnut and Pistachio, as well as SUPER Dark Chocolate again, with the Panna Cotta. Dont forget your punch card, buy 12, and get one kids size free!"
5,"Yummy yummy yummy! Absolutely loved it - kick back, quiet, people nice, not crowded and breakfast was crazy yummy!"
2,"Stopped in on a whim. The whole plaza gives me the creeps (although I do like Yucca tap room and Capistranos). But besides the plaza giving me the uneasy feeling, that even an unattractive mid-aged man could fall victim to a mid-day rape, I forged on. The rewards were less than stellar. I cruised the aisles of items looking for something I could purchase to add to my already cluttered abode. No dice. Everything is in that weird period, where it isnt old enough to be collectible, cool, or culturally relevant yet nothing is new enough to provide an upgrade. The only thing I thought was cool was a couple obscure punk CDs in the music section, but I already had the albums on my IPOD. I didnt see anyone else buying anything either but everyone did stop to talk to the old cooter working the register. He looks like he may be a plethora of knowledge and stories. Im not trying to steer people away, just saying I didnt have any luck, but then again I didnt seek guidance from the wrinkled prophet dishing advise and offering a safe harbor to those fearing the dayrape."
1,"How does this restaurant generate so many 4 and 5 star ratings?  I know it was on the food channel, but honestly the food was sub-par. Maybe it was just an off day, but I have a feeling it wasnt. The prices were not outrageous, but it wasnt cheap either. The atmosphere was nice, if very cafeteria like. But the food was way way too ""greasy."" And bland. And my stomach now aches after eating there...."
2,"If you order a top shelf liquor from the bar I suggest strongly you watch them pour.  We had a gift certificate to use, the first time we tried we sat in the bar waiting for our table.  Ordered 1 Grey Goose gimlet, and one just vodka gimlet.  We watched the bar tender pour just that, when we received the bill we were charged for 2 grey goose.  When we brought it to the bartenders attention she lied and said they were both grey goose.  We waited so long for a table we left, and thought we would try again some other time.  Next time, we ordered 2 Grey Goose gimlets, they gave us gibsons.  When we sent them back waiter returned with our drinks in a tall water glass.  They were horrible tasting.  This time we returned them ourselves to the bar.  Turns out they had to admit, because we were standing there, they were out of Grey Goose and asked if the could sub, and we agreed.  10 mins later we over heard a waiter bring out a ""Grey Goose"" on the rocks to the table next to us.  Pretty shady!! Food was okay, service marginal.  For the $$$ I would rather go to El Posto or Pizza A Metro."
5,"The BEST brewery Ive ever been to. Amazing beer and awesome food (I didnt think that combo was actually possible)! I daydream about this place all the time since I spent so much time here while going to school at ASU. Whenever I go back to Phoenix, this is always a must on my list!"
3,"Pomeroys and I have a really ass backwards relationship.  Typically, the purpose a bar serves me is to quench a thirst brought on by numerous factors, the most typical one being the uncanny excitement I have for making poor (but fun) decisions. Because of this, the purpose I serve bars is not only the obviously fiscal nature of the relationship, but I often serve as the harbinger of good times. So heres the problem with P-roys. I never want to come here. Ever. This is the place I END UP at and its typically the result of somebody elses negative circumstance that I dont really want to deal with (friend meltdown, death, crashed vehicles), and I almost always have to leave a place I like to come here. I know, weird, right? But Ive been here more times than I can shake a stick at, and while I am usually the omen of good times to come, I always know that if I am on my way to Pomeroys, not only will I be saving copious amounts of cashola, I also always end up having a blast and not doing something stupid.  So the role reversal always sends me for a loop, and the bathroom always smells like fresh poop, but I cant help kinda liking it."
4,"I aint from around here. Where I come from,  restaurants located in strip malls are not to be trusted. ""Feed me but be careful."" Speaketh my hangover and we rolled back the stone to the pasty-cave. So the hangover and I find ourselves inside the pit as The Soledad Brothers play and smoke rises from the narrow kitchen. Ten pounds of onion simmer on a grill.  A beautiful woman hands me a menu. Oh god, they are everywhere! That man making the food has an immaculate beard!!! Am I in Chicago?! Whats happening hangover?!   No. Im In Tempe, where there is a kickass restaurant that serves kickasser beer, and great comfort food to cure what ails you. Bangers and Mash. Mmmm. Mash."
1,I was accused of training my wife for compensation and was told to leave the gym or he (Page the trainer) was going to call the cops.  I dont know how a trainer confuses me working WITH my wife with training my wife for compensation.    Management handled this issue horribly.   Their lack of attention to the matter showed exactly what a customer of 6 years was worth.   You are treated only as a number.  Do yourself a favor and stay away.  I have since started going to a gym which is much more expensive but worth every penny to be treated with respect.
5,"As a Massage therapist I really need to get worked on to make up for all the massages I give.  Kristi is my go-to massage therapist.   With over 20 years of experience in the healing arts shes got amazing strength and sensitivity.   AND--shes a great listener--its kind of like getting a counselor and therapist all in one shot.  Its the best hour of my week!  """
1,"I purchased the Enotria groupon when it was released last year and had a horrible experience at the restaurant. 1) I ordered a cheese platter. The platter was very much overpriced at over $18.00. The most problematic thing is that Enotria ordered the food from another restaurant on Mayo Blvd and had it delivered to them. The same is true with Pizza. If you order pizza there, it will be delivered from another restaurant in the Mayo shopping plaza. Enotria is taking a significant markup on the food because they are paying another vendor for it. AVOID THIS!! 2) Another disturbing aspect of the visit was that we were served disproportionately small portion because we were using a groupon. We ordered two glasses of red wine. The waiter (who also happened to be the owner) served us a glass that was 1/3 of what is typically served. The only positive aspect of Enotria is that they have a good selection of wines. To be sincere, you are much better off going to a more reputable establishment in the area like White Chocolate Grill. Oh, also keep in mind that the current owner bought the restaurant over a year ago. It has changed ownership several times and the overall quality is suffering because of this. AVOID."
5,"Perfect burritos, polite staff with a couple cuties working here.  I love Chipotle!"
4,Wow! I am definitely impressed.  Ive been to a different Massage Envy years and years ago and vowed never to go back because it was the most mediocre massage I had ever had.  My girlfriend was telling me about how great the therapists are at this location so I relented.  I scheduled a 90minute deep tissue/trigger point massage with Joshua.  It was probably one of the best massages Ive had in a long time.  My back neck and shoulder felt so much better afterwards!  I was so happy after I even signed up for the monthly membership....Something very unlike me to do without thinking about it.  I guess this location is the only corporate owned store and not a franchise. No wonder! :)
5,"Im not generally a big fan of burgers, but I love this place!  Their ""blu burger"" is amazing!  Bleu cheese crumbles, carmelized onions and thick, crispy bacon on an awesome onion bun, oh my!  I highly recommend adding avocado to it as well.  I cant speak for the other sandwiches because I love the blu burger too much to order anything new. Heh. The zucchini fries are a thing of beauty AND they allow well-behaved dogs to hang out with you on the patio while you enjoy your meal.  They even brought my little guy a disposable water bowl! Ive also had great luck with their waitstaff, everyone is friendly and on task.  Its pretty busy on a Friday or Saturday night, but just perfect for a Saturday afternoon lunch."
2,Now they are using a hand held drill to buff toenails during their pedi instead of just a quick file.  I can definitely see grow out difference on my nail bed.  Not good.
4,"Came here for breakfast yesterday, it had been years since I have stopped in here and do not remember the entire place having waiter service.  Place was empty at 9am on a Tuesday morning but the atmosphere was casual, this place is pretty much been here for as long as I can remember and I am one of the 2 people that are native to Phoenix.  I always felt it was pricey but I think inflation has caught up since prices seemed normal when I went yesterday.  I loved the chips and salsa, the hot sauce is fantastic with a great spicy kick.  I went with the recommendation of the chile relleno which isnt my favorite but I like going with what waiters say so I gave it a try.  It was great!  Very flavorful and they just put it on the eggs so you can eat it together, the tortillas are fresh and home-made tasting, the hash browns and beans were good too.  I read my newspaper and drank my soda while I enjoyed the whole place to myself....oh yeah, I read some Yelp reviews and bookmarked my next stop too, ha ha."
4,"Why have I lived in the Valley for eight years and not been here until yesterday? Seriously was missing out. (And being such a Mexican food junkie that even my friends and family cant stand me warrants the trip alone).  Chimi = Good. Not as good as some other places Ive been to. But good.  Everything else = Really good.  Food is filling, and its easy to indulge in... Service bothered me. Dont get me wrong. Our waiters were very friendly. But its like... Dude...this drink has been empty for 15 minutes...why is it not full?! Had to ask for things, refills on water, more chips and salsa (Which are fabulous, by the way), etc, etc. Maybe Im overly expectant and believe that water glasses should be full at times. Either way, its not a big deal.  Carlos OBriens - you should expect my business in the future. I promise Ill be good and go the gym soon thereafter."
5,"Kindred Spirits has closed their doors. It is a sad thing that we on the west side of Phoenix cannot support such a friendly and community oriented business, AND one that gave you the option to drop by for a quick coffee or for a more complete dining experience. The live music on the weekends was also something a bit rare for our side of town, and will be missed. Richard and Debra did a marvelous job updating the space, and making it a warm and welcoming place. I am sorry that Youngtown has lost this business."
3,"If you have been to one CPK, you have more or less been to all of them. I went through a stretch when I really liked it here and I still dont mind it, I guess I just dont get excited about it anymore.  The BBQ Chicken pizza is my go-to but the Thai variations are tasty, as well. The appetizers are ok, the service is ok, but it all just seems a little played out to me.  I am waiting for CPK to make some moves, shake things up, add something interesting to the menu, because I feel like nothing has changed there since 1992.  Ill still drop in from time to time, but I wont be as excited about it as I used to be."
1,"This place is the classic bait and switch joint.  I ordered through the drive-thru and told the person I was ordering that I had a coupon for a ""buy one-get one free"" Chicken Tender Sandwich,  The bun was hard and not at all like the picture on the coupon. The two small tenders were extremely rubbery and looked like they had been retrieved from the trash can after they had been tossed for being under a heat lamp too long. The lettuce was the part that most people toss when cleaning and the tomatoes were thin and pale and looked like they had been genetically mutated . . .uhh, I mean grown.  This wasnt the first time the server manager did this to me. I should have known better. I used a coupon a while back there for a buy one, get one free breakfast burrito and asked that they prepare it to look like the picture that appeared on the coupon. My bad!  When I got down the road and reached into the bag to take a bite, the cook had apparently taken an onion and diced it up super fine and threw that in with it.  If you want a decent hamburger or chicken sandwich without attitude and that looks as advertised or better, go to smash burger. As for this place, never, never  again.  The only good Carls Jr. I have found in the valley so far is off the Superstition (Hwy 60) and Tomahawk.  From the Manager down, they strive to live up to their advertising."
2,"Its ok, good for a quick bite. I dont understand the almost cult like following. Made a mistake and had the shake instead of pop and was sick for hours. Staff was very friendly, but they needed someone dedicated to keeping the place clean."
5,"We used the taco cart for my 30th birthday this past weekend and we came away very impressed. Eduardo was the guy that came to our fiesta, and he was incredible. When he arrived, we experienced a haboob and he immediately stepped in and helped bring in our decorations and furniture. He waited about 30 minutes until serving because we were unsure if the haboob was going to attack again. My wife and I are both in the restaurant biz and so were many of the guests, we all came away impressed with the food quality. Next time we throw a party, we will use them again! Make sure to get the el pastor and carnitas. Great job Hector & Eduardo."
2,"This place not recommend, food was cold, rice was soggy, lettuce wilted, and beans runny."
5,"For the past ten years (ever since FunSports occupied the same unit), this place has been the one-stop shop for my biking needs.  From BMX at age 13 to road cycling in adulthood, SMC usually has what Im looking for.  The prices dont really compete with larger chains like Performance, but they are reasonable and the service more than makes up for the difference.  When I was getting into road cycling, the guys at the shop were very helpful with selection, fit, and pricing.  A+!"
5,"It was 3:45pm and Im about to jump on a bus to the light rail.  We have no reservations for Pizzeria Bianco, but a couple of friends just got in line and were waiting to get some wine.  Useless fact: theyre 26th in line.  So in theory, at 5:00 were in the first seating.  And so it happens, the publicly-underwritten public transit arrives (my one-way trip cost $1.25, my gfs unvalidated parking fee was $12) and two Hop Knots later, were sitting down and waiting.   Typical order, one of everything, two Biancoverdes.  At this point being almost review #200, the details are irrelevant.  The crust is great, the cheese is great, the Sonny Boy is uber-salty and delicious, fruity olive oil, holy shit these roasted peppers, etc.  Why is that person staring at me through the window? So I guess the point is, if you make it your only point to go to Bianco, its hard to be disappointed."
4,"When I found out I was going to Scottsdale for a vacation, I signed up for Groupon and was excited to score a tequila tasting at Cien Agaves! Well, I didnt read the fine print and it was only for the last Thursday of every month.  Not a problem - the owner/manager was great when I told him I had kind of skimmed over the fine print, and he still honored the group on.  We had delicious tacos, yummy margaritas and left thinking how great people in AZ are :)"
4,"Chakra has a very cute little cafe which I really enjoyed my first time there.  The day before, I had a steak for dinner..shhhh..however, really wanted a veggie filled meal for lunch.  I ordered the Pesto Basil Focaccia (tomatos, olives, peppers, feta) with a mixed green salad with a zesty lemon dressing. I loved it.  Lots of flavor and the bread itself was moist and light with a crispy bottom.  Cost was somewhat high I thought ($15) when ordering, yet it was really good and what I wanted so I was ok with the price . It did take awhile for it to come out, however, I wasnt in a hurry though.  The tea of the day was a strawberry green tea.  Very good, light on the strawberry so it didnt taste like a juice.  I did purchase some Vanilla rooibos tea and a cherry black tea.  Only complaint and being a Tea Snob with over 3 years working in the Tea industry and 80 hours of training, the teas should be in air tight light tight containers; keeping the air out keeps the teas fresh (green teas will go badly quickly!)  Chakra staff was very helpful and friendly.  I will go back to purchase herbs and teas in the future."
3,"I know everyone has raved about this place. So naturally, I was was super excited to try it. I dont know if it was just so hyped up or what, but it just seemed like a normal pizza to me... with a really long wait. I was meeting some girlfriends there for lunch, we got there a few minutes early and asked to be seated, but they wont seat you until the whole party is there, unfortunately (although understandable!). So we stood outside, in the 108 degree heat until everyone got there. After waiting over an hour, they finally were able to seat us. We had three kiddos with us, and they told us they only had two high chairs. (Not a huge issue, but definitely not convenient either.) I thought their menu was extremely limited, only have 6 pizzas: 3 with red sauce and 3 with white sauce and then just a few toppings you could add. While the food was alright, I didnt find it over-the-top or spectacular as I had expected. Needless to say, Id have no problem going back but I probably wouldnt seek it out."
5,"Some of the best Italian food I have ever had. This is a favorite for my wife and I. Sima and Marcellino are very nice people, very inviting. The bar is small but fun to hang out at. The food is always fresh and delicious. Watch out for Marcellino - he likes to push the truffles."
4,the grilled chicken sandwich hold the mayo add ketchup and mustard and the fries - off the chain!  minus one star because it should stay open later.
4,"The crew at this location is very good. Theyre quick, thorough and will address redos without out any hesitation. I usually go with the Ultimate Package during the gentlemens day special for $15 bucks. This package is the best deal  (Wednesdays for the guys) with a full wash, super coat,  extra hand dry, interior/trunk vacuum, interior/exterior windows, full interior and tire dressing plus air freshener of choice.  Ive only experienced top notch service here and Ive been pleased with the job these guys do."
5,I love supporting local coffee houses and this one is my favorite.  They are always super friendly even if I sit in there for hours studying and only order one drink.  I LOVE their sugar free avalanches!
4,"Orange Table is one of my go-to spots in the valley.  The food and atmosphere are superb.  The wide assortment of beverages certainly strengthens OTs menu when pairing food and drink. I will admit that while the location may seem hard to find, there are times where Ive had to wait, and wait...but if you enjoy great food then it is worth the wait. Their salads and burgers (especially the wine burger w/ cheese and red onion) are fantastic!"
2,"Save your money and go to Kyoto Bowl. Our waiter gaves us our metal bowls and then coddled my family like were children. They have all the waiters follow us to get in line for the self-service buffet. They stand there like if you get out of line, youre bad. Weird...During this time, the waiter goes on and on about their food and what they have. Then when you get to the buffet, the choices are very limited and the food is so full of fluff you dont get to put much food in. Some of it is meant to be like sushi, uncooked, but since you put it in a bowl, it gets cooked with everything else. Oh yeah, and the place is loud. Youll have to sit elbow to elbow to hear your family. The novelty about this place is that you can watch the cooks cook your dismal amount on an open fire oven. Thats the coolest thing about this place. They serve it in these trendy lopsided bowls. At this point, the food has really shrunk. The food is tasteless. Anyways, they give you the bill and even though somebody else paid for my bill, I was shocked by the price ~ $10 a bowl. If I had $10, Id rather go to Taco Bell."
4,"This place is a very chill wine bar. Came here after flying in for work and wanted something that would be light, have a good wine selection, and a nice outdoor patio/bar area. Daily Dose fulfills each of those items.  You MUST get the bruchetta plate."
5,"Absolutely adorable! This place made our 5 (yep you heard it here...5) hour wait much more enjoyable.  I think it we had to sit in the same building as the pizzas were being made and had to smell the delicious aroma of others pizzas for 5 hours, I may have gone nuts.  Bar Bianco was relaxed and had everything anyone could ask for while waiting for your meal.  We loved the Arizona wine and enjoyed a tasty plate of cheese and meat while lounging in the cozy chairs in the corner.   Not only is this bar a great waiting room before Pizzeria Bianco, but I would consider coming here just to relax and have a drink. Cheers!"
4,"Good place to meet a group, watch a game or grab a quick bite. We found this place on St. Patricks Day after a long, frustrating day of apartment searching. No wait, quick/good/friendly service, good food and lots of good beer. I like the segmented areas and because it is so big, even when there is a huge crowd, you never feel like you have lost your personal space. Have walked over many times since and will definitely continue to."
5,"My meal at FnB last weekend was one of the best Ive had in Arizona. I love everything about this place, the food, the cocktails, the staff, the atmosphere. It was a rainy Sunday. I knew the restaurant was right next to Cowboy Ciao, but managed to walk right by it (my friends noticed me go by). I turned back, and Pavle was nice enough to wait at the door, and said ""Ben?"" as I was about to pass by again. I agree with what everyone else said here, Pavle really makes you feel at home. I started with the slivered fennel salad and a ginhound. I split the order with a friend, and they were more than happy to bring the salad split  onto two plates for us. I love citrus, and these were a very refreshing start to my meal.  Next up was the trout. It was presented stacked on top of the sunchokes and caramelized onions, with some wonderful broth on the plate. The combination of flavors was rich, and amazing, and the presentation ensured that every bite was as good as the last. I could eat this every visit, but I sampled the chicken and lamb, and was just as blown away. For desert I had lemon cake with ice cream and strawberry compote.  FnB has been receiving a lot of positive buzz lately. Its well deserved. If you havent visited yet, youre missing out."
5,"I do love rum and should review the Rum Bar separately but both the Rum Bar and the Breadfruit restaurant are equally awesome!  Great recommendations from the waiter... Brown Stew Chicken and Jerk Chicken are really good... really spicy on the jerk chicken but thats somewhat expected and perfect for me! Ill take my plantains baked over fried any day! SO GOOD! Really great place to go for not so typical food!  The entire place is quite small in a perfect intimate way.  Their seems to be a lot of pride in the menu, environment and service, which is rare to see in restaurant employees. Not to mention a perfect location ... very walkable to other nearby bars and easy to make a whole night of downtown phoenix!"
5,"Once you buy a steak from von hansons, you will never buy steak anywhere else again.  This is the best butcher shop I have ever seen.  Also great sausages, chicken, cuts of lamb. I also get my thanksgiving turkey here."
4,"This place was AWESOME!!!  My wife and I have been driving by this location for a couple years and finally decided to go in, I had a yearning for Ramen.  It did not disappoint.  We got there just before happy hour, which is always a bonus, but would still go outside of happy hour.  The menu is quite extensive, the bonus is they have Italian noodle dishes as well.  We have been told that this is authentic to Japan so I was impressed to see this in the valley, having been to many ""Japanese"" restaurants. We decided to try many different dishes, and were equally impressed with all.  I had the TanTan-Men, a spicy Ramen with pork, delicious.  We shared some tuna sashimi, which was fresh and tasty (looked like real pink, no added color).  We also shared the Seafood Delight roll, which has tuna, krab and is topped with a scallop, fantastic.  The last thing we ordered were the Spicy Korean Ribs, this was my least favorite, but still good.  Of course the Kirin (on draft) was flowing as well as the house Saki. Overall the CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe impressed us to say the least.  We will be back to try more.  Thank you CherryBlossom, keep up the Great Work."
2,"I agree with Chris L.; I was disappointed with the cafe.  Granted, I was looking for a college-type coffeehouse where I could grade papers, and this place just didnt have that sort of lounge-y feel that even certain Starbuck$$ have.  There was no background music being played, and even with my ipod/headphones on, I was distracted by nearby conversations.  I got much more work done at 3 Roots near campus."
4,"Having recently moved from the Bay Area, I had ignorantly thought that there wouldnt be any decent ethnic, especially asian ethnic, food. Thankfully, I am completely wrong! Elephant Thai is a good thai place with a varied menu, freshly made food, and nice atmosphere. An added plus to the Tempe location was that they allowed us to bring our small pooch to the patio area where we dined. We did have the corn cakes, which were ok. I dont remember them being bad or great...but my husband likes corn a lot, and I think he enjoyed them more than me. The green papaya salad was as close  in flavor to the papaya salad we had freshly made for us on the beaches of Thailand as Id expect around here. We also had the thom ka soup which was really tasty. It was a while ago, so I cant remember the entrees we got. I probably got the pad thai...just to try it, and some kind of meat dish. I definitely dont remember anything being awful...and although it might not have been exceptional food, it was enjoyable. Thai ice tea was yummy, and my husband had the limeade which was too tart for me, although he thought it was really sweet and quite good. I do remember that for 2 people, what we ordered was a huge amount of food that we had no chance of finishing, and yet the final bill was quite reasonable.  We werent able to order any dessert, but I did notice that they had the sticky rice w/ mango on the menu. It probably wasnt in season anyways, but I will definitely be ordering that at some point. This will definitely be one of our go to thai places."
5,Recently moved from the East Coast. So glad Yelp introduced us to Il Bosco. I highly recommend the Biaggia pizza. Its amazing. Great food and great hospitality from this small little spot.
3,"Where I live in Tempe, I can walk to the end of my street, hop on an Orbit which takes me to the main Bus Depot or can drop me off closer to the Light Rail stop off of Mill Ave. Not bad, right? I actually am enjoying the clustering of a real Bus Depot not anywhere near a residential area with plenty of security, lighting, public enough space in an easily accessible location in Tempe. I actually feel safe hanging out here at night and when I ride my bike to the station, all the bike racks face the security and transit office, so never had an issue with my bicycle here either. The buses themselves are fine, I have had some very bad moments on the bus with the passengers (ie the 1st time I got on a Phoenix bus, a knife-fight broke out and I had to stay for a police report, another time two guys were reading hard porn right across from  me), but its kinda nice mixing with people rather then being in a car-tomb. What I very much have an issue with is most bus stations. I have had bums passed out (dead?)  on the seat, meth heads, a single sign with no seating in the hot blazing sun (I am looking at you Scottsdale), seats no shade around, fights break out at stations. I try to call the metro, they say it isnt their issue. Call the police non-emergency number, they say its the Metro jurisdiction. For this very bad situation alone, I dont take the bus at night since all the stations near the arts area and central are not well lit, full of sketchy people and the buses take too long to come by (if they even stop). For this I am grateful for the light rail for late night Phoenix excursions.  Metro still has a lot of work to do, but considering the improvements I have seen with public transportation and bicycle awareness in the past 3 years, it seems to be going on the right route."
4,"I dont know what else to say that hasnt already been said! I went here for my birthday and it was such a nice and special occasion. Having Christopher cook for you and talk to you is such a unique dining experience and I wasnt disappointed.  However! I would have appreciated being told to have cash up front. Also, it got really smokey in the restaurant (it is so small) and everyones eyes were tearing up towards the end of the meal.  I would recommend this place to anyone!"
5,super great neighborhood bookstore. its local and not owned by the man. jimmy carter will be there signing books in febuary.  They have new and used book and something is always on sale. Its attached to wild flower and next to macs.
4,"Just down Scottsdale Rd from the plastic, the cougars, the roid rage, and the Delta Bravos is a little place that doesnt give a shit, in the best possible way.  In many ways, this is the dive bar Scottsdale doesnt deserve but needs oh so badly (and lets face it, being south of McDowell probably means you are not in Scottsdale by many peoples account, which is just fine).  To be clear, lets discuss some things a dive bar is...First, they serve drinks and beer. No basil martinis, No Sonoma pinot noir, and No craft double IPAs. Second, you do not come here to be seen or for a scene...see the first point for what you come here for. Third, the motif...none...unless you count a few characters at the bar.  Now those are the basics, but Rogue Bar adds in great local and national acts, a diverse, non-Old Town crowd, and a friendly staff.  For instance, I recently saw The Mulhollands, from LA, and I assure you, this band will soon be playing venues where you wont be getting up on stage with the band...not that anyone I know did such things.  That is a great thing about RB, the lack of pretense carries throughout all aspects...even the DJ let me play with his DJ toys.  Yes, yes, you dont want to model your toilet after theirs, the pool table is old, and you may see a fight. But, these are added flavor for a true dive bar.  At the end of night you can say you had the chance to -- crash in some comfy booths, play some pool, order pizza for the bar, meet some real people, have a cheap drink, and if you are lucky, hang out with the band at an after party.  If you like a dive bar, go. If you dont, stay up the road, nobody will miss you at Rogue."
4,"Parking can be annoying when its busy, but the store is spacious and there are plenty of people to get help from."
5,"Can I review some of the people who go here? Because I know one idiot who would get 1 star.  (But the park still gets a 5) One dude let his dog pee on me! And the little bugger was fast! Hed prance toward you, and before you knew it, his leg was up and piss was streaming out of his winky cannon!  My friend was tinkled on multiple times; she wasnt able to jump out of the way very quickly since she was pregnant. Did the man say anything? Only that his dog was only nervous. Are you kidding me? Alright, I got your number. In return, we very actively encouraged our Australian Shepherd to play with the little terrier. Why? Because the Aussie Shep becomes a drool monster at the dog park, and the little pissing terrier (who only likes to pee on people, not trees or anywhere else in the park) ended up DRIPPING the Aussie Sheps saliva. Sweet! (that was the only time we didnt feel guilty about her saliva marking other dogs)."
4,"Sadly, my mom fell down a wet grassy hill walking her dog on Monday night and broke her ankle in two places. Ouch! She was rushed to Scottsdale Healthcare North in an ambulance and texted me on the way to alert me of her injury. Lets just say I hopped in the car without blinking and drove up to Scottsdale from Tucson as quickly and safely as possible.  When I first arrived at the hospital she was in a very small room, directly off of the ER waiting room. Seriously, I thought  this was a closet, no joke! Jay, the RN, came in several times to check her blood pressure, take her to get x-rays, etc. You know....the typical hospital drill when you break your ankle! Anyhoo, he was so kind, gentle and had my mom in stitches (no pun intended - HA!) with his witty jokes. I could tell my mom thoroughly enjoyed his company and care. He was so wonderful and really helped take the pressure off of what was going to happen next....surgery!  Shout out to Jay...You are awesome and thank you so much for going above and beyond to take such great care of my mom! After five LONG hours of being in the ER, my mom was moved to her own room on the Orthopedic floor...FINALLY! (Side note, all rooms at Scottsdale Healthcare North are single room occupancy. This is such a fabulous accommodation!!! That means no fighting over the remote or loud snores coming from the other patient.....YAY for mom!) At this point I knew this was going to be a long night and an extensive journey. We arrived at her room (on the 5h Floor) and were pleasantly surprised by the immediate welcoming of the evening nurses. They quickly got her settled into her room and made sure she was comfy. The room was small but super clean so no complaints there.  A little while later we were told that my mom was going to have surgery sometime in the early morning but didnt have a confirmed time. Lets just say we both too tired to care because by now it was going on 2AM!  I left the hospital and headed to my moms house for a few hours of sleep before I returned in the morning for her pending surgery. Got there around 8ish and still no surgery time. Ok, at this point my only complaint was the waiting and the unidentified time of her surgery. This seriously went on all day until finally at 6pm she was wheeled down to pre-op. Again, more waiting as the anesthesiologist had a crisis situation with another patient. At this time I was fortunate enough to meet Dr. Nelson who was performing the surgery on her ankle. My impression of Dr. Nelson was that he was very warm, compassionate and informative. He asked for my phone number and said he would call me directly after moms surgery with an update.....and he did!  An hour or so later my mom arrived back at her room from recovery. All went well and it was time for sleep. I returned the following day (Wednesday) and waited her release. Ugh, more waiting.  My mom was finally released Wednesday evening around 8pm with no problems or issues. YAY, we are going home.  Overall, the experience at Scottsdale Healthcare North was pleasant and satisfying and Im so thankful for their excellent and professional care with my mom! The doctors, nurses, physical therapists and aids were amazing, caring and extremely helpful. You can really tell these people are passionate about their job. Fabulous job Scottsdale Healthcare North!!!  Oh, one more thing..... Note to mom - no more slipping down wet grassy hills!"
3,Good fish fry place. Ive also had there Monster Burger- delish.
5,Amazing!  The Chicken sausage pasta definitely works!
3,"These folks pour a DRINK for $3 on Saturdays! They have daily specials and the Saturday special is $3 SoCo or Three Olives. Saturdays also offer a turkey cheeseburger and fries for $5, but I didnt try it. You can see all their specials by hovering your cursor over the day of the week on their home page (http://www.16th.st/index.html) It was NOT crowded when we cruised in for the Sun Devil game this past weekend. We were greeted by a guest who asked if we had a reservation and then hollered to the waitress who said there may be a wait. At least they have a sense of humor! The advantage for us was we got to take our pick of the TV we wanted to view the game. There were two Texas Hold Em poker tables going (not my thing so I dont know specifics) and I saw pool tables in a separate area -- photos on the website make it look like theres shuffleboard too. Definitely looking forward to going back. It was a great place to watch a game. Ill have to try the food next time and maybe theyll get a bump to 4 stars (although, I observed their nachos are real cheese nachos, and Im a fake cheese nacho girl so Im gonna have to pick another game day food!)"
4,"Perfect location for breakfast before SF Giants spring training game. Also, Perfect location for drinks and snacks after the game. Enjoyed 3 meals in two days and will recommend to all my friends."
3,"The food is moderately priced and good, but the drinks are outrageously Scottsdale expensive.  Ill admit that they key lime martini was very delicious.  The Hells Fire chips and Asian shrimp were perfect, and I would definitely recommend the food.  The lighting, more like a glow than a light, was quite awesome.  Service was pretty slow but professional.  The dj was great!  No one was wearing jeans, but there was a mixed crowd of some people in their 40s and many in their late 20s or early 30s."
3,"So, Jimmy Woos. One thing that cant be argued is that they had a great interior decorator, right when I walked in, I loved the vibe. We were seated immediately, and promptly served. The service is excellent and efficient :) We started with the egg rolls as an appetizer which were dee-lish-ous! And I ordered off their fancy drink menu and got a Jimmy Palmer, yum! For entrees, which they serve family style, we got the Shanghai Delight (broccoli, snow peas, and shrimp in a sauce) and the Chinese Braised Short Ribs. It was pretty good food, a little less sauce though on both dishes would have been preferred. The shrimp was cooked alright, and the ribs were very tender with a somewhat smoky taste. Again, if there had been less sauce, I think I would have enjoyed it even more.  Like a lot of other posh Chinese food places, as my mother said after wed left, ""Jimmy Woos is simply glorified American-Chinese take-out."" Its true, but it makes for a pretty good dinner in Old Town."
4,"If you need a hat, this is where to go."
5,"The Montelucia Resort is home to Crave Cafe, and the fact that I was blown away by how beautiful the resort is has nothing to do with how impressed I was with Crave. What are you craving at the moment?  Perhaps a cup of coffee?  a scoop of gelato?  an empanada? gourmet pastry?  homemade tomato soup?  perhaps a panini sandwich filled with turkey, cheese,  grilled eggplant, and cranberry compote? red wine? magazine? fresh fruit? Diet Coke? Whatever your crave-ing - Crave has it all! In addition to pretty much anything your heart desires, Crave also has an extremely friendly staff and offers limited seating (in and outside) with gorgeous views of Camelback mountain. After a full tour of the resort, we were hungry for lunch and decided to have a quick bite at Crave... We shared a sandwich, slice of quiche, and tomato soup - all of it was delicious!  I am sure Ill be craving a return trip to the Montelucia sometime soon, and when I do, Im sure Ill pop into Crave for whatever I need at that time."
5,"The Flower Studio far exceeded my expectations at my wedding! Christine is an amazing artist, businesswoman and person. She made time to meet with me outside her regular hours and really understood my vision for my wedding. Her arrangements for my wedding were absolutely stunning and really took the event to the next level. I am more than thrilled with this company and would recommend them to anyone. Thank you Flower Studio for making my wedding so beautiful."
5,"Yummmmm .... so authentic  This is one of the few mom & pops type of restaurant in N Scottsdale that taste oh so authentic and fantastic  This is by far my favorite italian restaurant in town, way better than the big chain like Brios (dont get me wrong, they are not bad either) It is not a fancy place but very cozy. And it does make you feel like you walk into one of the ristorante in Italia .... the owners are 100% italiano and they only use the freshest ingredients ....  I had the best lasagna there, you can taste the texture of the noodle, the creamy-ness of the chess, the meat favor and the freshness of the tomatoes... totally awesome.  Had tried the seafood linguine there too .... oh so good as well and with plenty of seafood ... definitely 2 thumbs up.  During winter, make sure you make reservation ahead though .... this place seems to be snowbirds favorite too"
2,"I dont get it!! My husband, daughter and I went to eat at Joes because we saw a menu in the Hotel where we were staying nearby.  The Menu mentioned that the TV show DINERS DRIVE-INS AND DIVES had done a show about the place and indicated the menu items that were highlighted on the show that were supposedly delicious! I called ahead for directions and was greeted with an attitude when I explained that we were from out of town, staying at a hotel that has their menu and needed directions to get there.  I assumed since the menu was in the hotel room that the employees at Joes  would know how to direct someone to get there from the hotel.  After I explained several times the cross streets and the name of the hotel where we were staying, explained that we were just north of the 202 freeway etc and was just about to give up, the girl finally was able to give me directions.  Was that an omen of things to come?? The first irritation that we encountered was standing in line and trying to decide what we should order while there was only ONE cashier.   So when we did reach the window to place our order we could practically feel the irritation of the people waiting behind us while we tried to ask a few questions about the menu.  Feeling pressure to hurry up by the impatient look on the cashiers face we ordered a variety of things for the three of us.  The Fontina Burger, Pulled Pork Sandwich, Onion Rings, Sweet Potato Fries and Fresh Beet Salad. With the variety of what we ordered you would think at least one of the three of us would taste something we liked, but the only adjective that we could come up with for everything was BLAH.   I am not exaggerating....we were all hungry and we are not picky eaters, but we just couldnt get a good bite of anything. Also when I placed our order I asked for side orders of the onions rings and sweet potato fries but the cashier rang up full orders which I didnt realize since my husband paid the bill not knowing it should have been less.  Our bill for the 3 of us was equal to what we would pay at a restaurant with someone serving us!!  I wouldnt mind so much if the food tasted good but......   TheFONTINA BURGER was cooked very well done (I ordered it medium/well).  It had a very slight smear of pesto (so slight that I couldnt even taste it) with a few small pieces of mushy grilled pepper and the fontina cheese.  The burger was so unremarkable that I cant even remember if there were ""greens"" on it our not.  I would describe this burger as DRY and BLAH. The ONION RINGS had such a crunchy exterior that it actually hurt our mouths to bite into them.  Besides that, the onion pieces were so thin you could hardly taste the onion.  It was like eating a basket full of crunchy fried breading. The SWEET POTATO FRIES and the WHITE POTATO FRIES were also just BLAH....how can you mess up fries??  After some serious thought we decided it had to be the type of oil that they were fried in.  It was just tasteless.  Even salt and ketchup couldnt help these fries!   The BBQ PORK SANDWICH was just okay as was the COLESLAW.  Not really much to say about them.   The BEET SALAD tasted like dirt.  My daughter and I both love beets but neither of us could take more than one bite of this salad. The PICKLES that they put on top of everything are just gross.  What they heck is wrong with just a dill pickle?  Why the sweet and sour wierd flavor combo?? There is only one DRINK MACHINE and CONDIMENT BAR and it is OUTSIDE!  So to fill your drink or get your napkins and ketchup you have to go out the door and stand in line then try to get back in the door while juggling everything.  Irritating! More irriation came in the form of the FLIES swarming our table which made for a very frustrating time of swatting them off of our food between bites.  We were all hungry but none of us finished our meal because we were just bored and frustrated trying to get a good bite.  We even tried to doctor stuff up by dipping our fries in the bbq sauce and adding ketchup to the burger but we just couldnt fix any of it! We left feeling ripped off, vowed to never return and decided we deserved to stop for an ice cream someplace on our way back to the hotel to get that IRRITATING, BLAH, SWEET and SOUR, DIRT flavor out of our mouths. PAY ATTENTION TO THE DETAILS would be my recommdendation to the staff of this place because everything really adds up or takes away from the dining experience.  We were overcharged, irritated by the set up, atmosphere and flies and we were still hungry when we left!   I am submitting this review because I dont want other people who have never eaten here before to be fooled by the FOOD NETWORK show hype the way we were.  The only reason I gave two stars is because I like the ""farm fresh concept"" and wanted to give the place credit for that."
4,Foodie from Cali here on business. Nicely done dishes with authentic flavor. Ling Shrimp to die for - at ridiculous bargain prices. 5 stars if they expand menu. Very nice family setting.
5,"This place is awesome.  A cornish pasty is like a big calzone stuffed with whatever you choose. They have many choices and all regular choices are also available as vegetarian entrees. These are HUGE so come hungry! Their tomato soup is also good but I would definitely stick to a pasty if you want a delicious meal. The place is pretty divey but in a really great way. I have also heard they are expanding so those of you who have complained about their cramped quarters may find some reprieve soon. Personally, I like the small dark divey feel. They also serve Rogue beer which is delicious if you havent tried it.  I like this place so much I eat there whenever I am in the area, which has prevented me from trying many other places nearby but I cant seem to bring myself not to go to Cornish as it is so good every time. Highly recommend it if you are in the area."
4,"Awesome job rejuvenating this bar from the dark dive bar it was. They have a great selection of brews from all over AZ, the US, and the globe as well as a very decent wine list. Thus far Ive tried the pork tacos and the grilled cheese, both of which were delicious. Service was a little on the slow side as our server was clearly over-loaded."
3,"I went to Susies for lunch the other day. I got it to go, as I was alone and dont like to eat at restaurants by myself. There was only a few people inside and the food seemed to come pretty fast if you eat in.  I probably waited about 20 mins for my to go food. I thought the restaurant was in need of a remodel. But they dont seem like they have the greatest hours, as they close at 5pm. So it is a lunch place, not a dinner place. I got my food and took it home. I live not even a mile from this place. I ordered Sopes. They had shredded beef, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes and salsa. I thought they were very comparable to the ones I have had before, which were homemade.  I would like to go back for lunch, but as Im not home much for lunch it might be difficult! Definitely worth a second chance!"
2,"When I bought my house a year ago, it came with a big, half-dead front lawn.  I decided to do a desert landscape out there instead, & called a number of landscape contractors I found here on Yelp & also at the Home & Garden Show at the fairgrounds. I soon learned that this is an unprofessional industry overall.  I had several company representatives never return my call to set up an appointment to come over & do a survey.  I had others schedule an appointment & not show up.  I had others come & do the initial survey but never get back in touch with me with a price.  One guy I called said he would look at my yard on Google Earth & email me a survey.  (He never did, & I guess a $3500 job didnt make it worth his while to come over for a few minutes!)  I had a couple of others who got back in touch but with only a materials list.  I had asked for a sketch of what they would DO with my yard for all this money!  After probably more than a dozen tries, I finally had 3 legitimate, complete surveys in hand to decide between, & the price range only varied about $500. One of my surveys was from Tom Baird at Creative Environments.  After the survey, he emailed me a materials list & a CAD drawing that gave me a good idea what my new yard would look like.  I liked it, so I went with them.  Next, though, my job got handed off to another company rep, David Inness.  David was likable, but the job ended up changing considerably from the agreement I had with Mr. Baird.  For instance, I was promised that a BobCat skip loader would be used to dredge down 4"" to remove the old grass before the new materials were applied.  That & other promises were not fulfilled. On installation day, three workers (& no ""Foreman Chico"" whom I was promised would be here) came out to do the work.  They didnt remove the grass at all, but rather put down some black plastic material over about HALF (!) of the yard.  I complained, & one of the workers called Chico on his cell phone & handed it to me.  Chico explained to me that they werent going to dig down, or put down any more plastic, unless I wanted to go to the hardware store & buy some more myself!  I tried to call David Inness, but he was unreachable. The materials included a big pile of dirt & a big pile of gravel to be used for the job.  The workers hand shoveled the dirt to form the contoured mounds as planned, but then only applied a very thin coating of the gravel on top, leaving most of the big pile on the driveway, AND LEFT!  That was it, they told me, & that I could use the rest of the tons of gravel that I had bought in planters around the place, or if I wanted, they would have it picked up in a couple days! After trying to call for a day or two, I finally reached David Inness, who got the workers to come back over & finish applying the gravel, which they did, but unevenly.  The gravel depth ended up being zero to 3"" deep.  I moved it around some myself to even it up, but I shouldnt have had to, & since I didnt get the dig-down preparation, the gravel was already skating out onto the surrounding driveway & sidewalk.  David had the workers now dig down a little around the edges, so that the top of the gravel would be down about an inch to stay put better. This was the worst contractor experience I have ever had in my life.  The only thing saving it from a 1-Star rating is that the nice plan for the layout of the dirt & plants was followed, & the yard does look good now.  Of course I have a problem with grass coming up through the gravel, since it wasnt scooped out as promised.  (I attempted to kill it ahead of time with weed & grass killer as directed, but all my estimators told me you really need to do both.) If I had it to do over, I would have gone with Michael at Breese Landscaping instead."
4,"Humongous flat screen TV!!!! That is the first thing I noticed about the room! Pretty awesome!  The room is cozy, and a decent size. The king size bed was comfy with fluffy pillows. The living room had plenty of seats that faced the flat screen TV. The room has a mini-fridge and a microwave. The only gripe about this place is a very small closet and bathroom. There is barely enough room to close the door for the bathroom. The closet also had one sliding door.  The continental breakfast was average. No hot food. Guests can choose either cold cereal, instant oatmeal, juice and milk, fruit, yogurt, toasts or bagels. The seating area in the kitchen was convenient for guests to enjoy their meal. If you need access to computers, they are located next to the kitchen. There is a printer as well."
1,"NOOOO!!!  Dont think about it!!!! Had my windshield replaced by these schmucks. The morons tore up the interior of my car, and damaged a speaker cover.  I had to call them about replacing the cover thrice, they finally did, and then I found out that there was a HUGE air leak in the corner. They never fixed the interior trim. They sent out the same first idiots to plug the leak, and they ended up breaking a ton of clips for a covering on my car, ruining the windshield wiper covers, and DOUSING my tweeter in water. I called immediately after they left and got harassed by a ""manager"" because he just had hip surgery (why is this my fault?!) and couldnt come until a week out! Whatever incentives they offer are not worth the TERRIBLE craftsmanship and poor service.  I am exploring my options with a lawyer, and have reported them to BBB."
1,The owner has changed hands & this place isnt what it used to be.  If you want up to date paper & quality product...go to Scrap Happy OR Crop Girls!
4,"Walking into this place is just plain confusing.  You could tell it used to be something different, but Ive got no idea what.  I guess it doesnt matter.  It just sort of looks cheap.  But thats ok. The food was right on, and Ill be back for more.  Bento Box A?  Yes please.  Small salad with a great ginger-type dressing, some sort of spicy beef, teriyaki chicken, rice, egg roll, some edamame, a few carrots... am I missing anything?   The service was great, the food even better, and it only set me back about 5 minutes and 8 bucks.  It seems like a sure bet, and close enough to work for a good take out that it will rise toward the top of my list."
1,"Went with three others. My first & last visit.  The menu did not properly describe the item and instead of a bell pepper dish, I got a port dish. It was dreadful. The other three I went with were not very happy with their meals either.  The restaurant was extremely noisy. Not pleasant at all & terrible food. Will never go back.  A big disappointment.  They cant even describe their items properly so you never know what you are going to end up with. They called it a pepper dish and it was a pork dish. The sauce apparently contained pulverized peppers. Are they stupid?  I should have trusted my instincts & not the commercial.  Its a third world country. They can barely afford to feed themselves. They have no history of cuisine.  I wouldnt waste my time and money on this place again."
4,"Who doesnt like Costco? I can only see two drawbacks.  One - do NOT go on a weekend.  It is crazy unless you go when it opens and get outta there quick.  Two - you only have two people in your household so you dont really need a 20 lb bag of broccoli or a whole box of strawberries or tangerines.  Other than that its a great place to stock up.  They have great deals on most frozen foods (try the all natural fish sticks).  Great deals on bottled water and cases of soda too.  If you buy a giant pack of Q-tips you wont run out for years!!  I love the ""Wipe and Clean"" individually wrapped cleaners for your glasses.  They come in a giant box of either 200 or 300 and last for at least six months.  They have good deals on books, DVDs, CDs, boxes and bags of snack foods like Doritos and Sun Chips, pretzels and microwave popcorn.  The bakery has some good stuff too.  I dont typically buy meat here because I do not have a large family nor do I have occasion to feed many people.  I hear the meat department is quite good though.  And Costco usually has the cheapest gas around too.  Its usually almost 10 cents cheaper then the closest gas station to me and I can stop by Costco on my way home from work.  Now if youre shopping and you require a snack, hit the snack bar.  Pizza by the slice, hot dogs, and these yummy things they call chicken bakes are pretty inexpensive.  So where else can you stock up, get cheap gas and get a snack for cheap?  Costco!  Its worth the membership and that membership gets you other perks too. They send coupons in the mail every month.  If you dont have a card, you should get one and check it out.  I believe they only accept Amex cards but they do accept debit cards and cash of course."
5,"i tried the thai river noodles. they will not replace the love i have for a dan dan noodle bowl. but the thai noodles, they were good. i like this place because it has really opened hours compared to everything else around here. and the food in inconsistent. oh also, the new soda machines are very entertaining. just watch.... this is usually a last resort option (everything else in the area is closed). but it is a good one nonetheless."
5,"I dream about their chopped salad...I, too, would use it as my screen saver if I didnt share a computer."
4,"Dear Weather & Coffee, Im really sorry you had to close.  We had a lot of good times together.  Every time I came in, you always seemed really happy to see me... even though you knew me by the wrong name.   I may be Kelly to everyone else, but Ill always be Aubrey to you."
5,"I love this restaurant. Very cheap, very clean, the food is sooo good. My mom and I eat there once every couple of weeks, sometimes twice once a week. The staff is very friendly and attentive. The environment is very comforting. I recommend this place to anyone who loves cheap but tasty Mexican food."
4,Very good food. The tepanyaki was great! It does have a certain atmosphere though. Remember to dress appropriately. It can also be a bit pricey.
2,"I went here for a business conference.  Granted, I just came back from a REALLY nice place in NYC, but I still expected something amazing since it was called the GRAND RESORT.  I must agree with fellow yelpers that it seemed a bit outdated.  I did not like the rooms.  There was a baby sink and mirror area.  A bazaar bar in the living room that just didnt seem to fit.  The beds were mediocre.  I did enjoy the kid free pool!  I found it very hard to find my way around this damn place!  I got lost several times :)  I did appreciate their concierge service - very helpful.  I needed a sewing kit to fix a button that came off - $7 later, I had one small thing of thread, baby scissors and a needle.  Drinks and food were sky high.  We ended up walking down to a little mexican food restaurant nearby.  I dont think I would go back..."
4,"This place is very popular and I can see why...the food was incredible!  Cool, neighborhood place with good service."
3,"Meh, Im not completely sold. Its so much smaller than a traditional B&N and they did not have anything I was looking for. Nevermind any of the school related supplies I would have like to seen. I dont think Ill come back here, Ill make my way to Borders (yada yada as you will). I wont be going to the next nearest B&N (Tempe) because I dont have a car and the energy just isnt worth it."
3,"Qdoba is a kicked up version of Chipotle/Kokopellis.  You walk up, choose a form of delivery (burrito, nachos, salad, burrito bowl, etc) you get a choice of meat (chicken, steak, etc) then you chose your toppings (different salsas, lettuce, cheese).  We all know the drill.  I will say one thing Qdoba is much better in taste than Kokopellis and Chipotle."
3,"For opening night, there was a giant wave of people coming through the door.  The bar was dimmed in red and purple lights.  The bright new white dining tables were ready to be eaten on.  All new upscale posh furniture in the bar, dining area, and patio.  We were not able to get dinner but well be back."
4,I agree with others that it seems a bit expensive at $15- but that still would not steer me away from going. For the first time in about 8 years I found myself at the DBG with some out of town family. Wanting to enjoy the weather (since they had just escaped the cold grey winter of Detroit) the gardens were the perfect spot. The garden is equipped with wide paths and plenty of benches to help the old timers pace themselves. It helps remind us city dwellers of the beauty the desert can have and how unique Phoenix truly is.
1,"Im never shopping here, I dont wanna shop somewhere where associates think if u can afford it in just goona purchase the bag online then looked at if I could afford it"
5,"I am a way more frequent visitor of the bell rd location, but sometimes I have to travel downtown for work. When I do, I make my route pass by this place because I have to have dutch bros.  The guys at the bell location are pretty familiar with me by now but these guys still treat you as if you are there best customer. And its the best coffee Ive ever had."
3,"Beautiful Casino. Im into architect. Yet, if you are a slot machine gambler for the fun of it or not. This may not be a place I would dump my hard earnings into even if it where just for fun. I was out her with my Uncle and although I didnt play. He was having a good time playing 2.5 hours straight. Yet, as I followed in from one slot to another after spending a lot of his money down the drain. I noticed that not only did he not get any winnings, but no one around was winning either during the entire time he played. Really?!?! Not only was he in the hole, but many others. Very ODD that I noticed this. Also, no one was working the floor asking anyone if theyd like a drink. Perhaps, I may be used to how Vegas does it? Im curious for other feedback from other attendees at this place. Have you had any winnings?  We initially came out her for the Vietnamese Concert and Show. I would provide a rating for that, yet its not a regular performance at this Casino. So I will refrain."
4,"My prom date brought me here 10 years ago. Hmm...I wonder what he was expecting at the end of the night. Although he thought that tanning until he was as red as a lobster was the new black this was one of his better judgment calls.   We had a window seat and I mesmerized him with fascinating facts about the city, which were on little plaques along the windows. It really took him until the end of dinner to figure it out. Anyway, I am sure the menu has changed, but the salad and shrimp with angel hair pasta I had that night were yummy. Cool view. I will have to come back sometime to see how the valley has changed from this view."
5,Even more great news....on Tuesdays there is a special of 35c per ounce. Not that I needed another incentive...but this is GREAT.
4,"Our group enjoyed a fabulous lunch here this past Sunday. The patio is perfect for people watching on a beautiful afternoon.  Appetizer: Crab Cakes. The guys really liked the crab cakes which appeared to be served with some sort of cream sauce with diced red and yellow bell peppers.  Appetizer: Spinach Cheese Dip. This dip fits the standard and is served with crispy pita-esque bread pieces.  I truly appreciate the large selection of Gardein entrees they serve for Vegetarians and Vegans that want to enjoy not-so- healthy bar grub like our omni friends. ** Be sure to note any dietary restrictions upon placing your order. I ordered the ""beef"" sliders original style and they came with cheese which was not mentioned on the menu. They gladly added a side of lettuce and the jerk and buffalo sauces to my plate. I adore there shoe string fries.  My companions enjoyed their ahi tuna salad and steak entrees.  As far as drinks go, there is a large menu sure to please everyone in your party!"
4,"While waiting for Ayesha to have dinner at Thai Elephant, I tried not to let the meth-crack-head who pretended to talk on the pay phone deter me from a great meal.  She had no shoes on and walked up to the pay phone and started talking.  It hadnt been ringing and she didnt dial a number.   Im a sucker for Touch of Thais catfish dish, and they had the same one on the menu.   It was good, but the fish was a bit overcooked.  I would have liked a bit more ""sauce"" as the dish was a bit dry. Service was excellent.  My iced tea was refilled without asking throughout our meal. Of course, spending and evening with Ayesha over spicy food as we both wiped our noses from the heat of curry cant be beat!"
4,"We were taken here by our host in Phoenix.  Its one of the prettiest Mexican restaurants Ive been in, with a courtyard surrounding a duck pond (there is a sign requesting you not feed the ducks tortilla chips!). The margaritas were great and my chicken was excellent, as were my partners tequila shrimp.  Would definitely go back there if I were to visit Phoenix again."
2,"I spent most of my first year being legal drinking age at this wild, college bar. It was fun then, but I got older, it wore on me. Its a big ASU bar and theres no escaping the drunk college kids. The guys can usually be found on the patio barking lame pick up lines at the female passerbys and the ladies are usually grinding it up on the small dance floor on the weekend nights. With the summer heat, Fat Tuesdays frozen drinks are appreciated. But if you dont want to drink them with the college crowd, hit the bar during the day or early evenings."
4,"I only recently discovered that I do not hate Thai, having never tried it, so this place was right up my alley. Its literally 1 mile away from our home and has a pretty extensive menu. The atmosphere is nothing to write home about, but if youre a fan of pastels and the early 90s, youll love it here. You may even want to move in. Our service was a little slow, but the friendliness of our servers (yes, multiple) made me feel ok about waiting a little bit for a third beer. Overall, Id say this gets a thumbs up from me and my other half."
3,"I had a hankering for raw fish today and decided to give Moto a try.  Overall I was pleased. The menu had a wide variety of tempting Asian treats but I was here for fish, so I ordered the sashimi combo with a bowl of Miso. The soup was a bit odd.  It seemed to be normal Miso soup with some shredded cabbage tossed in.  The cabbage added a texture that I didnt really want but it was easy to eat around it. The presentation of the sashimi was interesting.  I had a pinwheel of fishy goodness with yellowtail, smoked salmon and tuna.  The fish tasted quite fresh and the portions were generous. When I need a sushi fix for lunch Ill be returning to Moto."
4,"Lets start by making it clear that my dogs are my life. Completely obsessed pet parent here! I went here for a second opinion about one of my dogs after being fed up with my regular vet. I was really impressed with the premises and doctor. She was incredibly caring and helpful, and they did not try to get me to pay for anything additional. I really appreciated the authenticity and the follow up. I am now a regular customer (patient?) and definitely recommend this place for your furbabies :-)"
5,"5 stars for the great $5 happy hour specials. the short rib tacos and the fish tacos are delicious and a bargain at 5 for 5 bucks. My favorite drink is the green tea lemonade--it was heavy on the liqour and so refreshing. Service was flawless. We were greeted hello and goodbye by two cheerful hostesses, our waiter and waitress offered great suggestions and the bar tender was sweet as well."
5,"Delicious food and excellent staff make this small French restaurant worthy of five stars. We began with a glass of fabulous wine that we brought (it is byob) and ordered the onion tart as an appetizer. The taste of the leeks coupled with the cheese, buttery and flaky pastry made this one of the most tasty ways to start a meal. I ordered the marinated chicken. This dish came with a juicy chicken breast with a light pesto sauce, mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach. The flavors intermingled to create a sensuous bite, time and time again. My girlfriend got the filet, which was juicy and flavorful and came with perfectly roasted potatoes and tomatoes. For dessert we ordered the tart of the day, which was fruit and coconut cream on top of a shortbread-tasting tart. Just delicious. The service was wonderful, very efficient and friendly. It is not cheap, it was $99 for the appetizer, two entrees and dessert...but for the experience and the exquisite flavors, I will go back for any special occasion... guaranteed."
4,"4.5 stars Ok....I just had the most amazing facial there today....I never experienced anything like it.  And my pedicure rocked also. I dont think I picked a better day to have a little relaxation.  I rode almost 24 miles today (I swear it was all uphill) and I had the worst pain in my legs.  (Yes, I did stretch)   My pedicure was great...Shannon does a wonderful job....though now I have straight line syndrome with french man/pedicures.  Since I hate it that they have to use latex gloves, I couldnt tell at all that she was wearing them when i was getting my massage.  AND!  She actually made my feet completely soft and dry skin free.  That alone is a miracle.   Then I had my amazing facial.  Where do you get a facial that they put your hands in parrafin wax, massage your legs (I did complain about my pain....) and give the most relaxing neck, shoulder, and head massage ever?????  Laura is amazing...and she does a great job with waxing also.   I found out today that you dont have to be a member of Lifetime Fitness to go there...and I did hear another rumor that rocks...but I dont know if I should say it here...."
4,"Met for a business meeting, good happy hour menu, we had the flatbread which was great to share over our meeting with some of their house bread, which was excellent with the pesto. The well whiskey was poured nicely and our server was nice. Great for happy hour biz meetings on the waterfront, but only 3 tables in the bar, so you better get there early."
3,The best thing was the dessert. Shrimp was alright. Nothing to write home about. Wesabi chicken was lacking.
2,"This was real dissapointment because I really trusted the reviews but I realize there are couple of important factors. 1. this is college town 2. Az  (no offense) isnt the capital of great food. 3. a 20 yr palate is different from a 40+ yr old palate. Sorry to be such a snob but truly this food was just okay. If youre a foodie and really know great Ethiopian I would suggest you dont eat here. while the wait staff are really wonderful the food was just okay, presentation is nothing like usual Ethiopian fare (family style). The Dobo Wat was ordinary and my favorite (Gomen) was tasteless. they didnt include that grumbly cheese and my Doro didnt have the typical egg. The sauce lacked flavor."
3,"I didnt have a fully immersed Portlands experience, so perhaps I am selling them a bit short, but as far as my experience went, it was A-OK. We stopped in because of its proximity to the light rail and our need for alcoholic refreshment.  We had a couple beers (small selection - but we found something we really liked) and a glass of wine (reasonably priced, tasty) The service was fine, the prices fine.  Everything was fine. And thats just it.  Does Fine merit a Yay! Im a fan, four star review.  No it does not.  Maybe the food is out of this world.  Maybe at night this place lights up and sparkles in a way that the daytime cannot convey.  Its on the light rail, so I may give it another attempt, but on first glance, Portlands is just A-OK."
3,"Ive only flown in and out of Pheonix Airport through Southwest, so ive only been in one section of this airport- but it isnt that great. THe food choices are slim and none are fab- I mean, really what airport had fab food- wait DFW does! Anyway- the Sky Harbor does have is a great view and decently clean restrooms."
4,"Best shrimp burros. If it wasnt in the hood & make me cringe @ the thought of going in at night alone, I maybe would have given it 5 stars.  The staff is as friendly as any other Mexican spot. The place is kept decently clean. Dont let the outside totally deter you from at least stepping foot in the place. Theres a couple TVs playing Mexican music videos to get your mind off of waiting for your order, which is surprisingly fast. Call in orders are necessary when your trying to beat the lunch rush. But any other time, you could be out the door in 10 minutes.  This place has been here for a while now. There is other La Salsita spots to go to in the valley. Some tweaked their spelling but all in all, best shrimp burro on this side of Van Buren!"
5,"I had a great burger experience here and intend to return the next time I am craving a Fuddburger. I also got to introduce a friend to Fuddruckers for the first time, so it was a cherry-poppin adventure. Not only are the burgers here tasty, but I love the fact that you get to pick and choose the toppings from their self-serve produce and condiment bars. One of my favorite things on french fries is Heinz 57 sauce and Fuddruckers is truly awesome for including that amongst its vast condiment selection. As a professed condiment whore, I was thrilled to discover a new flavor of Tabasco I have never encountered before... and I like to think I really know my Tabasco products, having lived in Louisiana for years. This Fuddruckers special-orders the Sweet & Spicy variety of Tabasco which is not only great on a burger, but would work as an egg-roll dipping sauce. Knowing that I must have it for home use, my dining partner graciously approached the manager who arranged to allow him to purchase a bottle. This was just one example of how efficient, helpful, and friendly the staff here are. Next visit, I will demand to meet the one who refers to himself only as ""Mr. Crusty Baker"" (see photos). The restaurant also has a lot of shiny fun decor evoking shameless Americana and Route 66 roadside culture. The bright colors and the overindulgence in fast food goodness contributes to a heightened state of arousal that can only be described as a ""Burger Party Contact High"". You can just feel the burger love... the afterglow punctuated by the difficult click of the seat belt as you strap in for a ride back to a somber, less-gluttonous reality."
5,"I find it hilarious that someone would reference this place as being terrible,  compare it to (overpriced and bland) Humble Pie, and in the same breath say it was the best chili relleno you ever tasted.  I cant vouch for the chicken tacos but most street tacos are nowhere near packed with meat. By definition they are usually very tiny with onions,some guacamole, a little cabbage, and some small cuts of meat.  I can say the tilapia tacos are tops(large filet on each) on the list of my girlfriends quest for good fish tacos. I can say the pork nachos are the best I have had as the pork reminds me of Los Dos Molinos in a small way. The empanadas are excellent as well. If you go for happy hour you can get two empanadas for 6 bucks. You can also get 2 large fish tacos for 6 bucks. Would you like some awesome tortilla soup? 4 bucks. If you get the dinner version of the emapanadas with a large portion of some of the best rice and a side of black beans I think it sets you back about 11 bucks. I have also had the chili relleno and it is the best I have tasted as well leaving me to wonder with the single review you have for anything, why the venom? I learned long ago to ask for what is recommended for before you order and if someone recommends a place try what they are harping about first. When I asked they said the chili relleno, pork, empanadas, and red sangrias. Guess how my dining experience went? Try ordering tacos from Los Dos Molinos and you will leave pissed. Order the green chili pork and you will drive 100 miles for it. I do hope you give it another chance I have honestly never had anything sub par here in my 7 or so visits and they seriously could charge way more for quality than they do.  I agree that Main Ingredient is great also, thats why I took the time to write about it.  But to reiterate: 11-13 dollar for most dinner items besides new york strip(on the list to try), is not pricey happy hour has most items for 4-6$ street tacos are not bursting with meat ask what is the best thing on the menu when you order some place then you can write it off all you want. Humble Pie  was more pricey and not worth it, All it does is take up parking from a much better place next door. For a place with the reference to pizza in its name you would think it would be better, it tasted like peter piper. I would love to know what a good chicken taco is in your opinion, I cant think of any besides maybe the California tacos at the now closed Chuys, but the ones my sister ordered from here were full of chicken and topped with a nice chipotle/ranch like sauce which is similar."
3,This theatre is very conveniently located in the Arrowhead mall which of course makes parking a breeze. It isnt my favorite in town because there always seem to be tons of teenagers here (im sure BECAUSE it is in the mall) and yes I know if they are too loud then we are too old. In any case the theatres are busy and bustling. The concessions seem very high but I guess that is a trade-off for the convenience.
2,"If Cowboy Ciao is the best restaurant in Scottsdale then Cafe Carumba has to be just about the worst. This place is terrible. I went here with my family, and not a single one of us enjoyed our meal. The ""handmade chips and salsa"" were clearly store bought, and each of our entrees were consistently, blah. Nothing new or intriguing about any of their dishes, and the food just wasnt all that great.  With so many great choices in Old Town, why would anyone ever eat here?"
3,"This is a pretty chill spot for drinks & bar food.  We went on a Sunday night after a big meeting that was held at the Phoenix Convention Center.  They were able to accommodate a group of about 20 of us without any issues (not a whole lot of people there).   Their quesadillas and curly fries are quite good and I could not help reaching for the nachos again and again, but definitely avoid their Caesar salad (I know, who orders salad at a bar anyway?!)"
4,"They built a Sauce in Minneapolis & it only lasted three months. Ill never understand why, but Im excited they are in Arizona & plenty of them.  The Turkey & Feta salad is almost identical to my favorite at True Food Kitchen, which is a great thing. The paninis Ive tried have always been good & come with a side of seasoned chips. Ive never tried any of the pastas, but they all look wonderful as well. Great place for a quick, affordable, good meal."
5,"Dig it! Good beers on tap. Tasty food. Friendly servers. Cool place to hang out and relax. My fav pasty is the cajun chicken with the spicy sauce. Dont forget to check out the desserts. Towards the back is an iPad where you can pick a few tunes to be played..kinda neat if youre in the mood for something in particular. If you havent checked it out, you should. I like this location better than the Tempe location because it has more seating and a better scene for visiting with friends."
3,"I LOVE in n out burger, but this particular location kind of lacks. I order a double double, mustard grilled, no onions with chopped chillies. My burger came with onions and without chopped chillies.  Also mine and my girlfriends buns were stale."
3,"Pleasant and beautiful. Feed the koi fish cheerios. Bathrooms are out of a catalog...I want that! Walk at a snails pace, because its not terribly large. When youre done, walk down to Pita Jungle or Lola Coffee!"
2,"First off, let me say that I live almost across the street from here and have been waiting for a grocery store downtown for almost 5 years.  I was there the very first day they were open and have been back three or four times since.  I waited to write my review until they had their ""grand opening"" and until they had gotten into the groove of having a market. Boy, where do I start with the complaints?  The biggest complaint is not so much the hours but the DAYS that they are open.  Maybe Im weird but I do my grocery shopping on Sunday.  We specifically didnt get a few things from F&E because we wanted the ones from the market.  I try and go Sunday but they are closed.  Try and go back Monday...they are closed.  At this point, I really need those items and Im just going to buy them from a normal store.  It doesnt make any sense why you would have a ton of vendors there on Saturday dropping off their goods only to have them sit, locked up, until Tuesday.  If you need two days off, take Saturday and Wednesday off when the outdoor market is in full swing. My next complaint is the selection.  Im not even going to complain that you dont have basic things like fruit or butter.  Im going to complain that you carry fish from Alaska (not local) and that you carry Shamrock milk! WTF! You could be carrying SuperFarm milk, butter, and ice cream but instead you carry the same thing Target has.  Try supporting real local business instead of mega-giant Shamrock Farms. Finally, whats with the ""wine bar""?  Is it actually somewhere in the building or am I supposed to sit in the middle of the produce and drink?  It really feels like too much room was wasted on the sandwich/wine bar counter area and not enough was set aside for actual groceries.   I know this place will get better but right now one would be pretty hard pressed to do their grocery shopping here."
4,"From the get-go we liked this place.  The fried dumplings were wonderful and crispy on one side and lovely and soft on the other and the dumpling sauce was amazing and just spicy enough.  My husband refused to let it go and finished it over the course of our meal! On this, our first trip, we had Tangerine Beef and the Crispy duck.  The tangerine beef sauce was sweet and a bit tangy with a touch of spice and the beef was crispy and very tasty.  The duck was amazing.  The tastes were multilayered and well balanced and the crispy coating was salty and peppery and almost buttery under it all.  Together it created a very complex savory and sweet dish with a kick of spice at the tail end.  The flavors in the duck were very reminiscent of Cantonese food in Shanghai...this is the first time I can say this about a restaurant in the states that isnt located in a Chinatown.  The wait staff was friendly and very helpful, welcoming us back and giving information on some local Asian markets as we left.  I highly recommend this place!"
4,"Delicious. With me, im all about frosting.  And Sprinkles delivers! Big, thick layer of frosting on every cupcake. I recently had the Mocha, dark choc cupcake with mocha frosting. Wow... It was so rich i had to take a break of about 5 min before i could finish it. Im a big fan of the vanilla and banana. You just cant go wrong with cream cheese frosting, right?  OH!  And the best thing of all... You can get a ""shot"" of frosting!  Yep... A 1oz dixie cup piled high with a flavor of your choice for 75cents.  I usually eat my frosting shot in the store while waiting for my cupcake order.   ;-)  Its pricey, but its not an everyday thing... Its a treat and a good one!"
4,"This place is fast becoming a favorite happy hour stop for my fiance and I. Service is friendly, the paninis are delish and the bruschetta is to die for. Anything with their yummy fig jam is amazing. I love the ambiance. Very casual, trendy and lively with great outdoor and indoor seating. Id say service is on the slow side, but its understandable b/c the place is always packed. They have  pretty good happy hour deals. I will say that the parking situation kind of sucks (valet only unless you want to park down the street). But other then that, I have no complaints and will definitely be back!"
3,"The restaurant reminds me of a quaint little countryside café.   It gives me that homey feeling like a mom and pop store instead of the chain restaurant that it is. I like how whatever entrée you order from the menu; you can get a complete meal from it.  Each entrée comes with a drink, bread, soup or salad, and their spumoni ice cream for dessert.  However, if you want ""Italian"" food, youre not going to get it here.  Its a very Americanized version of Italian food.  They do have all the classics: the pastas, lasagnas, etc.  Ive been here several times and tried a few of their dishes. Spaghetti Vesuvius:  cute name to start off.  Spicy chicken sausage and meatballs with mushroom.  I didnt think it was that spicy, but it was extra salty.  Its a very flavorful dish, however the individual tastes are all mushed together.  The noodles are a bit tough for me; perhaps undercooked.  However some people like it a bit tough.   Gourmet Jumbo Crab Ravioli:  Theres not a lot of ravioli pieces in the dish.  The edges that were not covered in the pesto alfredo sauce was dry.  I did like that they used fresh crab meat in the ravioli.  The creamy sauce was not bad and it wasnt too overpowering in my mouth.  It was able to taste pesto sauce and still enjoy the texture of the crab.   Baked Lasagna:  This is the best of the 3 Ive had.  It has 4 kinds of cheese, ground beef, and pork.  First of all they gave you a huge piece of lasagna. Then they topped it with mounds of marinara sauce.  You may have to remove some of the sauce if its too much for you.  The noodles were cooked tender enough for my taste, but it was still able to hold its shape.  And the meat was blended well with all the flavors of the dish.   I do like the cute little serving they have of the spumoni ice cream.  Its a great blend of pistachio, chocolate and strawberry.  And its just the right amount after a large meal.  Maybe one of these days Ill go back just to try their chocolate desserts.   If you like an American spin on Italian food, then you would like this place.  Its a convenient place to eat after shopping at the mall and their quick service is great if youre crunched for time.  But the food is just average and not that special."
2,"Very disappointed!! I picked this place because of the reviews that Ive read here.  I feel compelled to give my 2 cents worth. We started out with jalapeno hushpuppies along with their remoulade.  The pups were very tasty (good start). For our main course, we ordered the fried green tomato salad to share, my wife ordered the gumbo with a side of fried okra, and I ordered the fried catfish with double okra on the side. The lag time between our pups and meal was LONG......outrageously long.  When they finally brought our meal, my wife didnt get her okra.  They explained that it would take a few more minutes.  Keep in mind, my plate had okra so I guess they must have forgot about hers.  It was no less than 10 minutes before they brought hers out.   When we finally received our meal the bartender apologized for the wait and explained that everything they have is fresh breaded and not frozen which is why it takes longer.  I can understand how fresh breaded takes longer but you should find a way to do it faster or take it off the menu if its going to logjam your kitchen. All this being said, even after the wait, if the food was good I would be writing a positive review right now.  The problem is, the food was just so so.  The okra had NO flavor and was not fully cooked to a nice crisp crust.  My catfish flavor was ok but the breading was pretty thick.  My wifes gumbo was a little bland....almost like the roux was a little weak.  I really wanted to like this place.  After our first experience, I wont likely go back."
4,"Love this little frozen yogurt paradise!!  I like Golden Spoon, but this place is definitely a notch above.  The toppings bar alone is a reason to check it out.....can you say Fruity Pebbles anyone? How awesome is that??? I like the fact that you choose how much or little you want in whatever combos you crave.  The flavors are also really yummy, and they always have a good variety.  Its a great place to take kids, as they tend to like anything interactive like this. Im so happy I live close & plan on coming lots as the weather heats up."
2,"Not good. The patio is top notch for relaxing if the weathers good but I couldnt shake that chain feeling when inside. Table and chairs had a slightly sticky feeling to them (nice, eh?). Food was typical pre-cooked, oven heated dollop of too much grease and cheese. Not impressed. Its a shame cause the garden and even the nachos & salsa had me expecting big things."
2,"Nothing great.  The salsa was very soupy, like youd get from a jar.  The hot salsa was even more liquidy and just tasted like chili oil or chili paste.  The tortilla soup was served like French onion soup, with a whole layer of melted cheese on top, and the broth underneath was really salty.  My friend who normally loves tortilla soup sent it back.   I went with the corn tamale.  According to the menu, you can choose either red or green.  I ordered the green, and the tamale was served in the middle of a sea of red sauce/salsa.  So I asked the server, ""Is this the green tamale?"" and she said that normally just the beef tamale is served red or green but I could have some green salsa if I wanted.  umm...okay. On the plus side, the service was very prompt-- our drink orders were taken immediately and chips and salsa were delivered 2 seconds later.  And the lunch menu was very reasonably priced, including $2.50 margaritas.  The food was just nothing special.  I guess the name should have been a warning not to expect anything too authentic."
3,"In here for a sec but everyone seemed to be having a good time!  Live D.j. and enough room to be who u wanta be on the dance floor... there was poker going on in the corner and with a nice sized crowd. I liked the bartender chick, and she was fast for being the only bartender in there, and very nice."
5,"Went here and we had a groupon. The ambiance was awesome. Two stories down, you enter a cozy space. We were a few minutes early for our reservations and we hung out in the bar. Table was ready and I ordered the lobster dinner. It was delicious and they cracked it table side. We definitely will be back again."
5,"One bite and I was transported back to the crowded streets of Monterrey.  I could almost smell the exhaust of the vochos and hear the distant conversation of the local policia extorting their prescribed mordida.  Quite simply, this is the taco as the way it was intended by its creators.  The pure and unadulterated classic enjoyed by the Mexican working class. What Pomo is to pizza, this place is to tacos.  Authentic...absolutely authentic."
4,"This review will be short and sweet. I promise! I was able to have breakfast here with the guys as our weekend was coming to an end and it was pretty darn good. I ordered the pancakes with scrambled eggs and extra crispy bacon. YUM! Dennis ordered the Mardi Gras omelet with fruit and I swear the is the second time this weekend he had mardi gras something. The first was mardi gras pasta over at pappadeaux. Hmm I see a theme lol. JD ordered eggs and chicken sausage and let me just say I have never heard the word sausage sound as naughty as it did with these two around. Even our server Steven was blushing by the time we left. All in the the service was good, the food was good and the company was awesome.  I will have to come back and try lunch or dinner one day soon."
4,"If youre a local, check out their spas slow day specials (most often a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday). Its a nice little spa in a great location and the staff was pretty good too!. It doesnt hurt that Trader Vics is so close by and has tropical happy hour specials for afterwards :)!. Great Staycation location!  Heres a sample of the newsletter spa specials:  http://www.returnity.biz/images/email/VHO/wVHO_020210.html"
5,"Fantastic place to learn Krav Maga and workout. My two sons have been going to React Defense Systems, RDS, for years and they finally convinced me to go. I love it and its too bad I didnt go earlier!  The instructors and facility are top notch. As a beginner, the instructors made me feel welcome and motivated even though my skills were untrained. After two weeks, I can feel, see, and hear the difference. I love smacking the bag with sweaty fists and feet and seeing the sweat fly.  If you are looking for intense conditioning, then RDS is the place. If you are looking for life saving skills, then RDS is still the place. Learn a great life skill, become fitter, and have fun.  I agree with AZ Central: RDS is the best boxing/martial art facility in Arizona.  In closing, Id recommend RDS to anyone and I apologize to everyone for not being creative enough to think of something funny or flippant.  Oh did I mention this is one of the few places in the world where parents and their kids can legally beat on each other and enjoy it?! When was the last time your son hit you? ;-)"
4,"Chance encounter on this little (well, maybe not soo little) gem of a place. Yelped it the moment I passed by it because of all the cars present in their parking lot. Although there are only 8 reviews for the place, what people had to say about it really made me want to visit.  Was well greeted on a spontaneous adventure to the restaurant for dinner. The bar was packed so my party decided to get seated in the main dining area. Got seated right away and was introduced to our server in no time. Think she had to swallow a chill pill or something because it took some time for her to be nice (most likely the main reason im not giving this place 5 stars) The menu was pretty reasonable. Starters dont exceed $10 and entrees range anywhere from $5-$15 (If Im correct, there is only one item on the menu costing $15)  We started off with three appetizers, thinking it would be the only dishes ordered (little did we know): - Grilled Spicy Chicken Wings: Some a little burnt but it tasted great. The portions are large and seasoning just right (or too bland depending on what you prefer). I liked that it was grilled, less of that greasy hell overwhelming the taste of the actual meat. - Homemade lemon garlic Hummus with pita : sooo delicious. It was only about $6, it comes with a bunch of pita. My party of 4 shared it and still had left overs =] definitely recommended. - Cheeseburger Sliders x3 on Egg Bun: The bun is delicious! and the meat is perfectly cooked (medium) and seasoned. The perfect balance of meat, bun, and cheese. Comes with diced pickles. We were having a jolly time when all of a sudden someone notices a dish being served to the the table next to us. It looked so good, she decided to order it herself. We ended up sharing the Half Chicken entree and I was extremely impressed with how it came out. The chicken is juicy and tender the entire way through. No parts of the chicken dry, every bite was well savored and just...mmm mmm mm Came with two sides (we chose the green beans/onions and mashed potatoes): green beans werent my favorite, they were overcooked but the mashed potatoes. Perfectly cooked, tasted so fresh. They dont use a ton of butter or sour cream which was favorable to my taste buds.  Would definitely come again FYI:  happy hour 3-6:30 pm. From what I could make out on the menu written in chalk: Half off appetizers and three 5.5 oz of draft beer for $5 (normally $6 for 3 - 5 oz beer sampler) oh and something about $5 wine"
4,"Wow. I forgot that libraries existed.  Until recently, when I wanted to get some travel guides for an upcoming European vacation. Then I thought, hmm... maybe a library would be a good idea. So I visited the Mesa library on my lunch hour and I was amazed at all the great books they have there. Seriously, there were all these brand-new, just-released hardcovers just sitting on tables, waiting for me to pick them up. I remember being a teenager and having to wait MONTHS to get new books. Now, apparently, because either a) no one reads or b) no one uses libraries or c) both, new books are readily available at the library. Well, good news for me. I also think the Mesa library may be a great place to pick up decent books because most of the patrons seem to be really, really old or homeless and possibly illiterate. Im not trying to be snarky, its just something thats quite clear from the moment you walk in. Overall, however, this is a very nice, well-stocked library. And you can even keep renewing your books on-line.  Thanks to the Mesa library, I just  may make it to the Yelp book club meeting  this weekend... !"
4,"Yelp search for vegan food led me and my mom here nice little place on a beautiful golf course. Friendly, knowledgable staff made my inner server glow when they knew which plate went where. Quite a few vegan dishes, delicious local wines. I really dug that they took a lot of local ingredients and added a nice flair to their menu. Glad I came!"
5,"What a wonderful night. It didnt start out that way. I found this restaurant on yelp, not realizing that it was sixteen miles from the hotel my wife and i were staying at. I heard the grief all the way there. ""Come on honey, its an adventure!"".  We arrived, and were greeted warmly and shown right to our table. Zach, our waiter, was right there to offer us drinks and appetizers. We had the Summer Rolls and they were delicious!  I explained to  Zach that I was allergic to wheat and he brought us a special ""gluten free"" menu the owner had created for those of us who are allergic to wheat. Zach even brought us some special wheat-free dipping sauce for the Summer rolls. He showed great care, provided great customer service,  and the sauce  was delicious! The portions were good sized and the presentation was beautiful. But the wonderful tastes and personal service made the night special. Oh, the bathrooms were clean too. Thanks Zach, and thanks Malees. It was a great night my wife and I look forward to repeating. (Yes, she admitted after dinner that the drive was worth it.)"
5,"NEW LOCATION FOR 2012:  Portland Parkway in Downtown Phoenix, Portland St. & Central Ave, right across from the Roosevelt Light Rail Station!  Saturday, November 12, 10am-4pm Find more info here: http://www.localfirstaz.com/fall-festival/ Bigger location = more fun!"
5,First hole in one on #3. Ill always love you Vistal.
2,"I was so disappointed in this place. I just moved out here and was craving filipino food and found this place based on reviews. Although the reviews were average, I was hoping to catch this place on one of its good days. Nope, not the case.  The place is not much to look at and the food did not look good. I was hesitant to eat here but was so hungry and saw that they had my fav dishes, sinigang and diniguan. They were both ok, Ive def had better. I ordered the pancit for my husband and it was terrible! He had maybe two bites and threw the rest away.  Oh well, wont be coming back here. Theres another filipino place in Phoenix so well be trying that next. Gingeroot, also in Chandler, is way better but expensive. Guess its worth the price when you have your cravings!"
4,"We went there for a dinner today, very nice place, a little noisy for my baby thougt ;) I had the italian wedding soup, it was very good but a little spicy. I also have a glass of wine, prosecco with passion fruit, very good... My husband had a tagliatelle w/braised short ribs, which he said was delicious.  The service was very good as well. The patio looks great for when the weather wams up."
5,"Beautiful restaurant! Terrrific service!  Wonderful, fresh and authentic cuisine - what more can I say but dont miss the Carpaccio!"
5,Went here for the first time a few weeks ago and it was some of the best BBQ Ive had in Arizona.  The service was great as well! The manager stopped by a few times as well as our waiter to make sure everything was good. *****UPDATE*****  Looks like they went out of business. Havent been open for two weeks now.....
5,"Seriously.  I seldom give 5 stars, but it deserves at least this much. If it wasnt for the location and the super scary after dinner club scene, I would go every.single.day. Truly one the best BBQ places in greater Phoenix.  My mouth is watering as Im thinking about the Hog Heaven special.  In fact, my puppies mouths are watering too.  Decent prices, giant selection.  One of those places where the early cowboys of the SW would appreciate.     If you are a cracker family, I suggest going super early, like super early bird special early , like when the snow birds come out for the senior special early, because after dusk, the whole place transforms into a pulsating super loud, super dicey Mexican Dance Club, and the blue hairs are sure to have a coronary attack after indulging in such a  lipid laden meal as they attempt to make their way out of the Club.     Ah the sacrifice for decent BBQ...."
2,Long waits and teenage workers with bad attitudes...nuff said.
4,"This HD is very good.  They seem to have knowledgeable people.  When I was putting in my irrigation system a while back I got a lot of good info from their plumbing guy.  Apparently he was a master plumber. On this trip I needed a overheat sensor for a can light.  The lighting guy had a can he said he couldnt sell because it was missing something, and proceeded to rip the sensor out for me.  No charge.  Thats customer service!"
5,"ABSOLUTELY ADORE THIS RESTAURANT!!!! Amazing location and such a great food !!! Been going there for a long, long time! I have yet be even slightly annoyed. BLISS! They wait on you hand and foot, food presentation and TASTE is Fantastic...Always make you feel very special.. the hostesses are not rude nor snooty and are always smiling- GREAT Managers! LOVE them all around! ( and I AM SUPER PICKY ( and Proud of it!) DO IT!!! GO THERE!!!!! #1 rest. per me in AZ for beautiful location and food!"
5,"I have been to Cherryblossom countless times for lunch over the past few years. I have to say the location kinda sucks, but thats because of all the traffic. Are they ever going to finish construction on Camelback?!  Any way, I decided to get a to go lunch order today. Since it was actually chilly out, I ordered the cha-shu ramen noodles with a couple of their yummy bread rolls & also picked up a slice of their amazing blueberry bread. The rolls were yummy as usual & I ate half of the cha-shu, so good & a big enough portion for me to have it again for lunch tomorrow.  Service can be slow there sometimes, its best to go at 11am or after 1pm, to beat the lunch crowd. Other tasty items I have enjoyed here are: cali crunchy roll, double shrimp crunchy roll, grilled chicken salad (w/ginger dressing instead), calamari, edamame & I have tried a couple different pasta dishes which were surprisingly good!"
5,One of my favorite places to take my 3 and 4 year old. Only drawback is it gets really crowded- especially with the school groups so we call early to see how many school groups there are and then we decide if its worth it or not. They sometimes host 500 kids at this museum and thats just not fun. Other than that this place is amazing.
5,I am for out of town and came here to celebrate my Birthday and it was a blast. The food was delicious and our Tepenyaki chef Robert was hilarious and very on point. This place is definitely a must when going to Scottsdale. I do go to Arizona a lot and will definitely be back soon.
4,"Formerly Sandbar, this is a great new spot in Central Scottsdale to chill out after work. Good Mexican food, good strong drinks, and a massive outdoor patio with pleanty of drinking activities. They also have plenty of TVs to watch the big game. FYI - It gets slammed on weekend nights..."
3,"We were going to movies when the skies opened up.   That is when we first noticed we needed new windshield wiper blades. Kinda dumb, right?  But, the only time we use them here in the Valley is after a car wash?  Think about it.   So we stopped at this location on Northsight, next to former site of ""Als Beef"" which is now closed.  The folks who work there stopped me as I walked in and asked for the make and model of my car.  Within ten seconds we were over to the aisle and had the correct blades for our car.  WOW!  What a great group! A funny aside.  As we left, I started taking out one of the blades and began throwing away the plastic and cardboard in the outside trash bin.  Another shocker.  It was filled to capacity with old blades.  Great minds, Eh?"
3,"ok experience, just got to a point I did not want my membership anymore and it was complicated to stop it all. I just did not like the autopay committment."
2,"Bleh.  I have been anxiously awaiting the opening of this spot, since I frequent the other spots on the same corner.  I had some pretty high hopes that this might end up rivaling Postinos or Bomberos... or well... something other than a drive-thru. I ordered the daily flatbread pizza.  It was a Chicken Teriyaki with prosciutto, pineapple and red jalapenos.  The ingredients didnt seem to be of the best quality.  The chicken was a little gristly (sliced breast meat would have been nice), and the cheese was unspeakable.  It was straight-from-a-bag mozzarella... which was congealed into a huge mass of grease.  The pizza was so wet with sauce and grease and heavy from too many toppings, that I couldnt even identify the crust... it was disintegrating before my eyes.  The prosciutto was all in one large clump, instead of being sprinkled throughout.  So disappointing.  My friends caprese salad was mainly a plate of tomatoes with a garnish of cheese and a sprig of basil.  I love a good caprese - and especially enjoy when there is a fairly equal amount of all ingredients.  Helps balance out each bite, you know?  No such luck with this one!  Our service was fine.  Helpful enough in the beginning, but I think once she sensed we werent thrilled with our food, she just tried to get away with a minimal amount of interaction.  The waitress never asked me how my meal was... even though I was clearly picking at it, and only ate half of it.  She offered to clear it away - not box it - so, she must have realized I didnt enjoy it. I will definitely wait a while for a return visit.  Since it is close and has a great layout/atmosphere, I am hoping that they work out these rather large kinks and become the kind of place that I would like to revisit."
5,"I cant believe I havent yelped about the place yet. Several months (maybe over a year?) ago my husband read a newspaper article about the Clover coffee maker and the one place in town that had managed to procure one. I was skeptical (as is my nature). It cant be that much better right? Youre just saying its amazing because you want to talk about the new hot coffee shop you discovered, right? Well, maybe. But I love this place. And I dont think it has a whole lot to do with the Clover. They roast their own beans and they roast them way differently than that other ginormous coffee chain - all a light or medium roast. Never bitter, never oily, never yucky. The coffee they make there is, obviously, the best. But I send my husband in every week now to buy a pound of beans so that I can approximate the same coffee at home. Add an edgy (though sometimes intimidating) seating area, great local art (which we bought off the wall), and smiley service...Im sold. Cant wait to try out the downtown location."
5,"Troy, the owner, is a brilliant businessman! Being a pharmacist myself, I am familiar with the quality of his products and his facility. Trust me when I say his sterile compounding areas are more advanced than many hospitals in the Valley. After spending a day at his old facility when I was still training, I felt comfortable enough to send my mother to Troy so that he could help her with hormone replacement therapy. The docs around town trust him enough to let him dictate what a patient needs; they simply sign off on his recommendations. My mom has had a huge increase in her quality of life since seeing Troy, and I feel the compounded HRT is safer than the Prempro she used to take. Do not hesitate to consult a compounding pharmacist if youre having health issues that arent being adequately addressed. Troy is one of the best in the Valley. Its worth the drive to consult with him, and further prescriptions can be mailed to your home."
5,"AAAAMAZING. They have the best hot dogs and corn dogs i have ever had.  It is definitely a place to try if you love hot dogs. They have good fries, excellent onion rings.... and very very reasonable prices!  I have never met a single person who has said anything but incredible things about Teds..... definitely a must try!"
5,"Im in (puppy) love with the new Wag NWash in Scottsdale... Id been to the Phoenix location years ago and remember wishing they were closer to my home, and my wish was granted... this new location is less than a mile from where I live! Minnie and I popped in a few weeks back for a self-serve bath.  I initially called to see if a groomer was in, but they were booked out for weeks.  Doing it myself was actually not only cheaper, but it was fun... and a good bonding experience for me and Min as well.  Sara helped us out and explained our options.  We decided on the ultimate wash which included an extremely efficient shampoo and conditioner, brushes, towels, cologne, etc... It was easy and quick - bonus! Minnie was clean and fresh within 20 minutes or so! Of course we spent a tad bit more time at the store doing some shopping and I was impressed with the dog food selection, homemade treats, eco-friendly collars and leashes, etc... Ill definitely head back to Wag N Wash again really soon... so psyched that they moved to my hood!"
2,"I almost moved up to three stars because Nicole, the pianist, makes dining here such an amazing experience, but the food just never is up to par, so 2 stars it is. I was here with the Downtown Friday Nights (aka #dtfn) crew, and started out with a glass of AZ Stronghold Mangus, which was a delight. We were noshing along, so I ordered the spinach dip, which was so salty that I couldnt even eat it. Yuck. I asked the waiter to take it back , and he said ""yeah, weve been hearing that a lot tonight"" News flash, if you are getting a lot of complaints, maybe you should stop serving it for the night. Im glad I had a friends cheese plate to snack on...it is hard to mess up brought-in bread and cheeses. My Florist is all atmosphere and no substance. The space is great, the piano is awesome (she will even take requests by text message, while shes playing) **Correction....the GM sent me a message pointing out that all of their bread is not, in fact, brought in, but is baked fresh daily. Duly noted**"
4,A hidden gem in downtown Phoenix. I loved the design of the restaurant and was so excited to try the food. The menu isnt large at all but there is great substance in their offerings. I had the chili lime chicken which was really delicious. I dont think I managed to eat even half of my order but it made for great leftovers. :)  I noticed they had a very reasonable take out menu too!
4,Im glad that Cafe Rio Mexican Grill opened up in Town and Country.  We have been to Cafe Rio a couple of times now.  On Tuesday they have tacos for $1.50.  Cafe Rio is now my favorite place for tacos.  The beef and pork tacos are the best.  If you are looking for a good taco you should check out Cafe Rio.
1,"I have so many friends that love this chain, but Im not a fan. Ive eaten at different locations across different states, but always end up sick. I think that I must be allergic to a seasoning that they apply to everything. Ive gotten sick from salad, pasta, to steaks. Needless to say, if a friend wants to eat dinner here, its tea or water only for me."
4,"I had a small fender bender in a hospital parking lot a few months back.  No big deal, and the other drivers insurance company immediately took responsibility, so all I needed to do was get an estimate and get it fixed. They were quick but thorough with the estimate, and when I brought my car back for the repair, they found some additional hidden damage, contacted the insurance company, secured a promise from them to pay the shop directly (so I didnt have to pay then wait for the insurance company to reimburse me), and still had everything done as promised, when promised, and they called me a few times to update me on the progress. The only thing that I would like to see would be some courtesy transportation, even if it would only be offered within a certain radius. All in all, they made the process as painless as possible.  Strong 9 out of 10; if they offered to drop me off and pick me up at work at no additional charge, itd be a 10 out of 10. I hope I dont need a body shop in the future, but if I do, I wouldnt hesitate to bring my car back to Brighton Collision Centers."
4,I really like the facial I had done. I was able to choose what I wanted and I could see the results when I left. Very nice.
1,"Went in for acrylics on Friday and it was horrible! Ive been getting acrylics for years and it has never been a problem to have them filed down...until this time. The tip of one finger was filed down so bad that its blistered. (At least the nail tech put some antiseptic on it so its not infected.) Also, when I put some lotion on my hands Tuesday a lot of my nails started getting sticky and filmy like they were going to disintegrate. NOT NORMAL! I removed mine today and found that my nails were finely filed, so it looks like they would have fallen off soon anyway. Im not going back there again."
4,One of the best breakfast places in Phoenix.  I love it.
3,"Narcisse is truly an interesting place.  Good food and pretty good service. The staff/servers look good and keep the ""image is everything"" so important here in Scottsdale working for this place even if the looks exceed the quality of the service. The late night crowd is of the ""look at me"" variety and makes it a good people watching establishment if you do not mind the huge egos that go with it.  The selections of food and drink are impressive. If you can reserve a table to dine and drink with friends do it as the place fills up and leads to a fun night out experience for the above 30 crowd."
4,"Im working downtown now (new themed list to come soon!) so Im exploring the area from a different angle. Im no stranger to downtown/midtowns happy hour and dinner spots, but Ive never had to go out and search for breakfast or lunch during the day.  I checked out Focaccia one morning when I hadnt had breakfast yet at the recommendation of my husband, Myles M, who works right around the corner. He said I should order the breakfast burrito, so I did, because hes pushy and I always do what Im told. Ok, neither of things are true, but in this case, he had conviction and I obediently complied.  The breakfast burrito was worth every penny. Being a somewhat recent convert to pescetarianism, I got it with egg whites (cool that they had that option), spinach, green salsa and potatoes. The woman behind the counter made it up right there on the grill and it was warm and delicious. The potatoes were skin-on which gave them a great texture and flavor. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the green salsa had a great kick.  The hot coffee from the carafe I got to accompany it was airplane-quality, but next time, Ill just grab something from Cartel on the way back to my office. God knows the burrito alone will be enough to keep me coming back to Focaccia."
3,"Good barbecue, but not great. I ordered the BBQ Sampler and shared with my wife.  With an extra side and a delicious chocolate chip cookie for dessert, it was plenty of food.  Unfortunately, the quality of the food wasnt as high as I was expecting based off of all the Yelp reviews. All of the meats were very tender... The brisket and pulled pork especially.  But they were devoid of significant taste and had to be drowned in BBQ sauce in order to taste anything.  Thankfully the sauce was excellent and readily available.  Of all the meats I sampled, the winner here was the ribs.  Definitely not the meatiest, but extremely tender. I could pull the bones right out and devour.  Delicious! Outside of the food, everything was excellent.  I arrived at peak time on a Saturday night, and the line moved quickly.  It snaked through the restaurant and out the door, around the corner, but it moved quickly.  We waited no longer than 30 - 40 minutes.  All of the servers were extremely nice and helpful.  There was plenty of seating available, especially outside.  It was a lovey place to enjoy a meal.  It is unfortunate that the quality of the BBQ does not rise above ""medium"" to match the high quality of the rest of Joes Real BBQ."
4,"Clean establishment. Rows of freezers in the back. Hidden from the street. Greeted by name what must be one of the regulars. Carries both Modelo and Dos Equis. Slowly made food for being dead. The green enchilada sauce is a must. Green chile chimis are fantastic. For the price, it was certainly filling and enjoyable. A place to come back to if youre craving decent Mexican in a sit-down environment but are too far away from a Blue Burrito Grille."
5,"I was sad to come back to lai lais and they no longer had the Mongolian :( boo,, but i took my mom there and we were starving so we decided to order off the menu. My mom is allergic to  msg and they helped us with what we should order. and she didnt get sick!! woo hoo.. we ordered three dishes and an appetizer to share between her , my bf, and myself, and we stilll brought food home, and I dont think we spent over $30 bucks for all that food!! it was very good to! i love good cheap food!! Ill be back, they are always friendly."
4,"Went Saturday and got there just after opened at 11:00am as suggested by other yelpers. Glad we did as filled up quickly. Rate 4.5 stars as Im a big fan of pub grub and atmosphere that goes with it. Would have been awesome if had a more brit/euro style feel by adding sports tele/bar music but thats being awfully picky, especially for such a small venue. Food was great, huge selection but could have been a tad warmer (my choice). Beer choices good, unfortunately out of my first pick but cant knock em too bad for that, and a bit warmer as well (again, my choice). Wait staff very friendly and efficient. Didnt have any unusual wait for service considering crowd. Prices I thought were reasonable, and we left full and satisfied. Definitely will be back again."
3,"Alison B. sums up all the great things about this unique store - and I would return if I was looking for a unique gift for any female friends of mine. However, when I went in on a Sunday I was 1 of 4 women in the store.  The man working was chatting it up with the 3 other women who turned out to be together, and once they left he had a seat and didnt say a word to me as I browsed.  I walked out after several minutes of silence."
4,"Popped into Sol Mexican Cocina before a movie one night for Happy Hour.  We were seated quickly, which was great because there was only 15 minutes left for happy hour and we wanted to get our order in before it ended.  Our waitress was SOOO... nice!  She had a great personality and was attentive and informative, pretty much everything you would want in a waitress. We ordered everything off the happy hour menu, so I cant comment on the main menu, but the happy hour food was great!  The Hubs and I shared the pork tacos and chicken tacos - he loved the chicken and I loved the pork - go figure.  We shared guacamole, which was good, but needed a bit more seasoning.  By adding the salsa, which was served with it, it became quite good.  BTW, love the unique ""chips"" that are served here... some of our had a ton of seasoning and others had only a little - we liked the ones with just a little.  We also shared the empanadas (I think thats what they were), anyway they were really good. Overall, we had a great happy hour experience here.  It thoroughly redeemed my not so enthusiastic impression from the Yelp event here (just about the food, not the event).  I cant say enough great things about our waitress - cant remember her name, but she was awesome.  I am sure we will be back soon to try out their main menu."
5,"This place rocks!!  We bought 750 sq ft of tile a few months ago to install on our own and we had no idea what we were doing.  They helped us every step of the way. We made several visits over the course of about 3 months and everyone we talked to was helpful and knowledgable. I will absolutely go back when we re-do the floors in the rest of the house. And the prices are the best.  I am a bargain shopper and will research prices for months before making a large purchase and that is exactly what I did when we embarked on this project.  I researched prices all over... online, in stores, with contractors, etc and Floor and Decor by far had the best prices.  The entire floor cost less than $1500 in tile, materials, and tools. It looks beautiful and I couldnt be happier!"
4,"I love the food!! Love for the environment.. eh.. not so much. Mom and I missed our reservation at Cowboy Ciaos on a Friday night and a worker recommended us to visit the sister restaurant ""Kazimierz."" Ok, well go as long as they have the famous Stetson Chopped salad. My mom loved the salad when she went to Cowboy Ciao. So we enter the restaurant and the place is so dark. How the heck are you suppose to find a table and read the menu?? We had no idea how the seating worked, so we asked a worker. We were seating within a couple of minutes. Mann.. we had to hold up the candle to read the menu. The environment is nice if you are just spending time with your friends and chatting. But to eat and see your food?? The darkness is not good for that. Anyway, we had the Stetson Chopped salad ($12). It was sooo good with the smoked salmon, dehydrated corn, pepita mixture, and the greens. Yummy! The Burgundian Flatbread ($13) was also delicious! I liked the crispy crust and the chunks of brie!! Wow!! The morels and the shallots gave the flatbread some sweetness. Since I liked the food, Ill give this place 4 stars. However, I wish I could see what I was eating. Thank goodness I took a picture of what I was ingesting.  The service and atmosphere is more like 3 stars."
5,"I just went here for the first time with my boyfriend this afternoon. I got a Green Apple Snow and he got a Mocha... Blast? or something like that. We both loved them. While the drink was amazing, what was even better was the quality of their boba, they werent too hard or squishy and they had the perfect taste.  The shop was really clean and nice and cool. I also noticed they had battleship and I think checkers and some other board games out for customers to play with. They also had a computer monitor I am guessing for games. I didnt go to look at it. I think there was music on but I cant remember. The service was really fast, but then we were the only ones there. You cant use a debit/credit card for an order under $10 so we ordered an extra drink for our friend we were going to visit. We asked if she could make it when we were ready to leave and she was really nice about it.  I cant say one bad thing about it. If I find something else on another visit I will update. As of now this is going to be my number one place to get boba."
1,I had not eaten in about 12 hours since we were at the hospital having a baby... and this pizza STILL tasted horrible. Barely average fast food quality and taste. Avoid!
4,"In Phoenix on Spring break vacation, we found Baby Kays by using the entertainment coupon book we bought to use while out there. They were in the front for fine dining, and had a great coupon deal, along with a sample menu. Everything on the sample menu sounded delish, and we very much like the spice of Cajun cooking. It was a little hard to find, although we were not at all familiar with the area. We had the wings as an app. and used the Louisiana gold hot sauce, something new to us that we are having trouble finding in Ohio since we fell in love with it there. The gumbo was outstanding, and even the alfredo pasta had a spice sprinkled on top for a Cajun style kick... it was unexpected, and awesome! Huge portions - that we both had plenty to take with us for a whole other left over meal. ... the prices were great, especially with the coupon (or actually the entertainment card that they punch for fine dining restaurants). Excellent staff- close to closing for the night, and welcomed us in, and didnt rush us at all - made sure we were happy with everything we ordered, very friendly! Definitely would recommend it for any one who likes a little Cajun kick, and something different from chain restaurants..."
5,"As far as sports bars go, this one cant be beat. You wont find one in the East Valley with better food, beer selection, happy hour, or a friendlier staff. This is hands-down one of my favorite places in all of Ahwatukee and the surrounding areas. Ive been here bunches of times, and the only one bad experience I had (overcooked burger) they took care of the situation above and beyond. I cant say it enough: go, eat, drink, see for yourself: Public House is the best around."
3,"Decided to check this place out for lunch yesterday. The decorations were very modern and I really liked the outdoor atrium you can eat in. I ordered a burger and wifey had the Hot chick sandwich. My burger was good, nothing to write home about but good. The wife enjoyed her sandwich, all though she overlooked the fact that the guacamole was spicy. I think this could be a great place to come and get some wine and appetizers, looking forward to coming back on the weekend! Late open kitchen is a bonus!"
5,"I am new to Jamba, however i am surprised at the AMAZING customer service that this store dishes out. One of the workers there has always noticed me as a regular customer. He has a stellar personality, gave me a 20% off card and sometimes has my order ready by the time i finish paying the cashier. Hes always very bright and smiling or laughing with his co-workers, I believe his name is Christian. He suggested a banana oatmeal with peanut butter the other morning and i have to say that it has been the most incredible oatmeal i have ever had!!! (You must try this) At times i visit the store twice a day simply because i cannot get enough Jamba Juice!!"
4,"I used to work near here and we got take out a lot.  My favorites: spinach enchiladas, green corn tamale, chicken mini chimis ( they come with a green chile cream cheese dip, OMG).  I loved their tex mex spin, not authentic Mexican, mind you, but tasty.  I cant speak to the service, I rarely went in to pick up, even... Im one of those crafty people who can get others to do that, lol.  I liked it though."
4,"Finally, a great Asian fusion restaurant. The service was super friendly. They even got me Yoo-zu tea because they didnt have honey. Server was great also and gave us recommendations about the amount and food choices because we asked - very professional.  Now, the food... - spicy wontons: mmmm deliciously fried to perfection and i absolutely love that wasabi sauce - shumai: ehhh..though a lot of people on yelp liked it, the skin was a little hard for me - sesame tofu: cute little deep friend tofu cubes - shabu style miso with shrip: warm light soup, definitely a must try - red thai curry: omygosh, that almost took off my tastebuds..i wouldnt recommend it unless you like spicy beyond jalapenos Overall, a great experience, delicious food, nice ambiance. Oh, everything fried tasted non-greasy and rather healthy - a rare treat. :)"
4,"Well my first review of Over Easy; have gone here a few times; only reason I dont go more often probably because of the wait. The food is definately makes me want to return.  The Hopple Popple, the Wolf  Pack, and what I had today, the Loco Moko (only criticism is the rice); great lemonade (when I used to drink lemonade) and the hash browns & they have tater tots!!! Ill be back; when I can get up early..."
5,There is no shortage of Mexican restaurants in AZ and this one is one of the tops on my list.  Its not your average Mexican fast food.  Its a little more pricey but well worth it.  Their bean and cheese burrito is so good (they say no lard and I dont know what else they use to make it good).  Their carne asada and pastor tacos are done to perfection.  I stop by whenever I pass by this place.
4,Pretty delicious -- very tasty sashimi platter. Loved the ambiance too -- a nice respite from the very toasty desert outside. :)
5,"Even for meat eaters, Green has a lot to love. A lot more than just tofu! I go here at least a couple times a month for lunch and its spectacular 95% of the time. A few of our favorite items are the BBQ ""Chicken"" sandwich, Thee Argentine sandwich, the crab puffs and of course, the Tsoynamis. Everything is fairly priced ($8 for a sandwich, $7.50 for a bowl w/ your choice or rice or noodles). The only thing I dont particularly care for is the buffalo wings as I think they are far too salty. The ranch that it comes with is fantastic, though. Also, if you get something with cheese make sure to use Daiya instead of Teese. Daiya tastes much better, in my opinion. The atmosphere is very artsy. There are always paintings for sale and there are a bunch of old car doors and hub caps over to one side. They just got a few booths which is fantastic if you want a little privacy. There is free wifi, a booshelf will all sorts of great reading, and the staff is always super friendly. Another great thing about Green is the vegan market. They have all sorts of great vegan foods and books for you to spoil yourself with. Its the only place I know of where you can find Teese, Food for Lovers Queso and Soy Curls. As an aside, I highly recommend Soy Curls as a healthy replacement to the meat in your fajitas or cheesesteaks. Another thing you absolutely must check out is their annual ThanksLIVING festival on Thanksgiving. They will load you up will all sorts of delicious and traditional Thankgsiving day food, veganized. ""Turkey"", stuffing, biscuits, brussels sprouts, asparagus, cranberry sauce, gravy, corn, pie and a drink. Youll get guest speakers, live music and local arts and crafts. Highly recommend."
5,I go there often. Love the food. Love the atmosphere. Great beers & usually great service
1,"Every time I come here the staff is so rude! Its the closest bar to my gate so Im kinda stuck. Hey staff, can you please pretend to like people????"
3,"Same Majerles menu as the other locations.  Decent food (especially wings), but high prices for both food and drink.  Good service -- even overattentive on my last visit.  Great setup for watching football games."
5,"Finally a teriyaki bowl place that does it right.  Nothing against Samuri Sams, but Yogis is a bit better in my opinion.  Yogis  menu is strait forward and clearly lists the options available.  The place is clean and the staff is fast and friendly.  The food is also very reasonably priced.  I was very impressed with their different bowl/plate/salad options.  You are able to order some teriyaki veggies, chicken and/or beef pretty much however you want it.  Extra meat, over lettuce, over veggies, brown rice, white rice, etc.   Anyway, when I visit a place like this my desires are simple.  I want a decent portion of not-overly-sauced white meat chicken over a bunch of veggies.  Thats it.  Yogis delivers this and then some."
5,"There are so many good things for me to say about this place that I have no idea where to begin. The ambiance is so amazing no matter what time of day you go. The small, intimate bar area (with quite a few pretty men!) is lovely on a sunny day out, while the tables inside are the perfect place for a romantic date. The menu is so great, carrying lots of new age food items (quinoa, black forbidden rice bowl, kale,and lots of dishes carrying local food items). It does make me very sad that they do not have a lot of vegetarian/vegan menu items. One time I tried to order the wood-fired vegetables and the waiter *swore* it was vegan. As soon as I tasted it I knew it had butter on it, and the waiter subsequently learned he had no idea what ""vegan"" meant. We ended up having to call a manager over. The cocktail menu is so interesting its hard to decide what to get. My favorite is the Dark and Stormy, which has ginger beer. *the BEST* cocktail around IMO. Do not pass up dessert. The bananas foster is amazing! Not traditional but good in and of its own."
4,"Ive visited the Crudo in Old Town and was really excited when the new one opened in Arcadia.  Visited with the bestie a nice quiet weeknight to enjoy some girl time.  You can get a 3 course meal for $35 and pick from salads, meats or what I would call side dishes.  Its a bit pricey for what you get portion-wise, unless you decide to order 3 meats..but who does that?  The wine is very reasonably priced.  The food is amazing!  Everything is cooked and seasoned perfectly, and presented to be delicious.  The decor is very simple, feels like you are in a big open warehouse.  Itd be a great place to have a group dinner for 6-10 as they have these rooms that are a bit more secluded they could put you in.  The service was a bit too good, to the point where we almost felt like she was rushing us even though there was nobody else in the restaurant.   Id visit again, but this is definitely a place to take another food loving girl friend- the boyfriend would be hungry and feel ripped off, its just not his style..."
5,"This is seriously one of my favorite restaurants of all time. Ive been many times and its always fabulous. I LOVE their Mahi Mahi Tacos - they are so good! I also highly recommend the Pork Osco Bucco, Smoked Red Chile Pork Roast, and the Cowboy Beef Stew. The nightly specials are often very creative and delicious. This place is also good for Sunday brunch. Good bartender too - drinks are never too weak."
4,"i used to come here all the time with my family, right after work wed head over here for some delicious pizza and AMAZING salad! Pablo Picasso Mexico Salad. was sent from heaven, one thing. I havent actually had it since I became vegetarian a couple months ago, but the salad without chicken would not be a miss!! You may be curious to know why we havent been here in so long, well just ONCE we saw a cockroach on the wall that grossed us out, and thats why this place loses a star. Other than that, I recommend it without a doubt. Thin crust pizza is way better than the deep dish here!"
2,"i was really unimpressed with the pizza here. its conveninetly located, but never very busy, even at its prime location by a bar even on a friday night. cheap slices, and easy to get in and out of, but of all the many, many people i know who frequent this area, none of them really ever eat there."
4,Excellent family owned business that knows how to make real Italian dishes!  Their prices are a little on the high side but you get plenty and its good.  We had enough left over for next days lunch.  The waiter was nice and attentive even though it started to get packed at around 7ish. They even gave us free Amaretto drinks after dinner! :)  Going back for another romantic dinner soon.
3,"even after 1.5 hours wait i loved the atmosphere and did not mind the wait at all. the service was good. not too friendly but everything we needed was on table.  Disappointment was domestic Kobe burger. it was served overdone (just little pink in center after i ordered it medium - rare) it is served with Asian slaw ( peanut dressing) which is served on top of the burger. It was way too strong and it took away from the burger itself. it was hard to taste the meat with so much peanut sauce in the slaw. If i was to order this dish again, i would ask for slaw on the side. the fries were fantastic and fried cheese was very good.  i will definitely be back for more for my friends loved their burgers.  the 3 stars is for the fact that burger was way overdone and i could not taste the major component to that dish - Meat!"
1,"I decided to break from routine and get a haircut at a local Great Clips. I called ahead and asked if they had an experienced barber that could do a flat top. The lady assured me that they did. I was Leary to say the least when she sat me in a chair of a 20 something fibbertygibbet dressed like Madonna. Half way through this butchering, she asked my advice and then the advice of the owner on how to accomplish this haircut. Kid you not, it was an inch longer at the sides than the center. I looked like a cross between the Gunny and flock of seagulls. I went home, set the clippers on 3 and finished the job......Would not go back here unless I lost a bet."
4,"we ate there this past saturday evening. arrived in time to take advantage of the 50% off wine price, which was great.  they have an extensive offering of wines, with emphasis on chilean and argentinian. delicious. ordered the fig/prosciutto salad that was wonderful. my companion ordered the salami/proscuitto/olive plate that came with bread and crackers. he ordered sangria. everything was very tasty. we sat outside. the atmosphere is so welcoming. had a great waiter. really enjoyed ourselves. we will absolutely go back."
5,"I am a huge fan of this restaurant. I love their locally grown fruits and veggies. I love their healthy options. I had their brown rice with curry sauce, veggies, and organic chicken...it was incredible! Cant wait to travel to Arizona again and return to this wonderful restaurant! PLEASE OPEN ANOTHER LOCATION IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA! It would be a hit!"
1,I love how all other Yelpers reviewing this company have discovered the same issues that would never permit me to use their services again. Company is a disaster and should be reported to the BBB.
3,"Very nice happy hour. Its dark inside but the beer prices are good and they have free sliders, chips and salsa."
3,"Reminds me of the 24 hour on Camelback - similar layout.  Ive noticed all 24 hour employees remind me of jocks.... well at least in Arizona. Anywho, I think they need fans in the cycle room - no wonder its so warm in there. Like all the 24 hours Ive been in Arizona, its just so warm. At least this one doesnt have a chloride or funky smell in the beginning.  Employees are receptive when you have questions/inquiries."
4,"I know that Wal-Mart gets a bad rap at times, but I need to report how nice they were to me the other day.  I went in there to buy some Christmas presents and found everything I needed and went to pay for everything.  I apparently did not take everything off the kyosk of bags and left one package there.  When I got home and these items were not in the back of my vehicle, I went back down there.  They told me to just go and get two more pair of the item I was missing.  I really felt they were so nice in doing that.  Thank you Wal-Mart."
3,"Overall good place. Pizza was good and a great selection. The service however was really slow and non-attentive. Took 30 minutes after being seated to have wine and sodas at the table. Cute place, but the acoustics need some help, very noisy. Would go back if in the neighborhood."
5,"What a great little find especially for Phoenix!  Ive been there on at least 4 occasions and have never been disappointed and just had to let everybody know about this little gem!  Recently  I took my mother and we had delicious Singapore Noodles and Malaysian Rice Noodles (which are kind of like Thais Rad Na but better).  On another occasion my husband ordered Pork Belly Curry and really loved it.  I wasnt as adventurous and had delicious Chicken Kebab Burmese style.  Family owned, quiet, and very affordable.  You have to really look for this place since its in a shopping center(its on the north side of Shea between 70th & 71st St in Scottsdale). Great early bird dinners as well!"
5,"I love this mall. You need a giant mall like this when it is 120 degrees outside! It is one of the only indoor malls that I like. I feel so calm when I am here. You can find just about anything in this mall.  The food court is pretty good.  I like Paradise Cafe for sandwiches.  There are sit down restaurants and a movie theater inside as well.  Plenty of parking or you can just valet.  My favorite Nordstroms is here.  I find the Nordies in SF to be too big and overwhelming.  The one at the Fashion Square is minimalist, well organized, and edited to suit my tastes."
5,"We-Ko-Pa has been prominently listed as one of the places to play if you are in Arizona.  I first played it several years ago, and it has become one of my favorite desert courses in Arizona.   There are two courses - Cholla, and Saguaro, and although they are both desert courses, they are somewhat different. The cholla course is an older, more mature course and doesnt have the same feel as the Saguaro course.  The Saguaro course can be walked, but has a wild side to it and to me, seems to have more elevation changes. That said, both courses are immaculate, wonderful condition, and a joy to play. Over the years, I have played the Saguaro course more, but lately the Cholla course has grown on me.  Now when my golfing buddies come down, I always make it a point to play both courses with them.  This has led to some interesting memories.   The first time we played, despite my warnings, one of the players wandered off the Saguaro course and found a Jumping Cholla.  He liked it so much, he brought it back to us - stuck all down one side of his body.  It took us quite a while to get them off of him - and then he wanted us to give him extra strokes. Not a chance. Another time, one of my friends teed off on a par 3 on the Cholla course, and hit it into a dry creek bed. He seemed to lose his composure, and hit five provisionals, which also went into the desert. Then he found his first ball, and ended up with a par!!  Of course, we havent let him forget the five provisionals... I have read some comments about the marshals on the course, and in the past would agree. However, the last two times we played, the marshals have been very good - very courteous and very helpful.  The last time, while we were playing cart path only, one of the players was very slow (as usual) and the female marshal most diplomatically asked us to speed up.  She was one of the nicest, most courteous marshals I have had experience with, and consequently, one of the most effective. The courses have a nice driving range, chipping and sand area, and putting greens. Unfortunately, they no longer allow you to use them, unless you are playing one of the courses (you used to be able to pay a daily fee to use them). Finally, the service is friendly and courteous - from the drop off, to the restaurant, to the desk personnel, I have had nothing but pleasant experiences with the employees. I think any golfer should experience these courses at least once - a visit would be well worth it."
3,"Daves has a good BBQ sauce and reminds me very much of KC style BBQ and sides.  I have eaten here a few times and found that the portion sizes are immense!   Service has always been efficient and no reason to complain about anything.  I think this BBQ place would be the best option for a large group. Is this the best BBQ in the world?  No, but I sure wouldnt turn it down! Enjoy!"
4,"Ive been here for dinner and the food was pretty tasty. The mixed grill platter is a definite recommendation, and the chicken biryani was full of flavor. The only downside was that the naan was just ok. Not straight out of a tandoor like naans should be. Their weekend brunch was decent but kind of disappointing. The chicken tikkas were kind of bland and there were no fresh puris to go along with the channa and halwa.  But all in all, a good tasty experience and definitely one of the better IndoPak restaurants in the Valley."
4,"Ate here again this weekend and I am happy to say that Fudds has officially won me back.  The burger was positively delicious!!!!  And this time, I ordered the fries without the seasoning they add to it. Perfect! Hey, Im a french fry traditionalist, what can I say? I hate weird seasonings or funky toppings on my fries (see review for Greek Gyro Express... and try to keep your cookies down)."
4,"My birthday cake came from Tammie Coe and it was AMAZING.  It was beautiful decorated with amazing frosting. But it was the inside that won me over. Gooey, decadent chocolate, oh my! It was so rich, I ate half a slice... but it was oh so worth it!"
4,"Great hotel- though its more of a condo. Got a room for my mom this past weekend and she liked it so much she didnt want to leave the resort. Our room was very large. Had s dining room, living room, fully stocked kitchen, 2 patios, and a large bedroom and bathroom. Theres like 3 or 4 pools in the resort, a nice restaurant and bar with live music. Its  Close to Desert Ridge, and the Quarter so good location for out of own visitors. Got an amazing price through hotwire. Service was also outstanding. Nice job Xona!"
5,"Really good pizza has to be among the most perfect foods in all the world.  Really good pizza would likely be on my last meal request list.  Specifically the roasted corn and goat cheese pizza at La Grande Orange Pizzeria which has to be near the top of the list for all the great pizzas the two us who contributed to this review have consumed.  And that is a lot of pizza. We were visiting Scottsdale as tourists when the concierge at the resort recommended this place to us.  Bless her.  Very convenient too to be able to shop for wine at La Grande Orange grocery, adjoining, and other goodies while we waited on our take out pizza order.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-grande-orange-grocery-phoenix#hrid:4cXbhzxxtmExF9kRjmFViQ/src:self The only hitch here is parking is terrible during peak hours. So it goes.  The pizza is worth the parking hassle.  Were on our way back to Scottsdale in a few days for another visit and La Grande Orange Pizzeria is on our ""go"" list again. The Rocket Man pizza is calling our name this time."
4,"Jan Ross has one of the best selections of crystals Ive seen - they literally had every crystal I was looking for, and I subsequently left as a satisfied customer. Friendly staff too."
3,"Ive never had any real problems with this store.  It is your typical lower income neighborhood grocer.   What really bugs me about ALL the Frys stores is their waste with receipts.  Call me a hippy, but more than half of the receipt paper has nothing to do with my purchase.  I buy 1 item and they hand me a receipt 12 inches long!  With all the stores doing that it equates to many thousands of pounds of paper wasted every year unnecessarily!  Hundreds of trees are dying because these guys just dont give a shit. Ya, ya, I know, its probably the least of this companies waste issues, but its one thats handed to me every time I shop there, staring me in the face.  I dont like it and I dont like supporting it."
1,"Nice facilities, nice AC, but two FATAL flaws: 1. Children running around yelling and screaming at all times.  This is a failure of the parents and, more importantly, of the staff who apparently REFUSE to enforce any kind of policies against noise whatsover. To parents and staff: THIS IS A LIBRARY *NOT* A DAYCARE!!!!! 2.  The ""collection"" here is 90% DVDs and ""Dummies"" books with trashy novels thrown in for good measure."
4,"This place is super darling. Thats right, super.  Ive only been once and it was to quickly grab some cookies to curb a serious pastry craving. I had never heard of Churn and found them via good old Yelp. I snagged a Chocolate Chocolate Chip cookie and another fabulous cookie that sadly enough I cant remember exactly. It had cranberries and it was heavenly.  I love how they have old school candy displayed through out the store! Good to know for when Im buying goodies for events or holidays. Their ice cream selection is killer and I will be making a special trip out there one of these smoking hot days to enjoy some!"
4,"In our continuing quest to identify cool, locally owned places to eat and/or drink, Caroline and I auditioned Vintage 95 last night.  Before I go further, understand that whenever I go out for eats or drinks, I have  in  mind a Platonic Ideal of the Bar/Pub/Eatery I most want to frequent. Im on a constant quest to find that  Ideal expressed in Real Life.  Vintage 95 isnt quite there, but its damn close. If I ever give something Five Stars, youll know it has pegged my Platonic Ideal. Anyway... The plan last night was for drinks. No plans for food, just Adult Beverages and warm conversation. But it turned into more. The location in downtown Chandler is terrific for us. The owners have created a very fine visual experience - leather, stone, dark woods, good lighting. And they dont have the music turned up so loud that you CANNOT HAVE A CONVERSATION. This is one of my pet peeves. If I want to stare at people move their mouths while enduring an aural assault, Ill stand on the deck of an aircraft carrier. When I go out with friends, I want to enjoy their company AND their conversation. Is that concept so difficult to grasp? [/rant off] The atmosphere at Vintage 95 is very close to my Ideal. Id go back just to sit on the leather couches in front of the fireplace, and then go back another time to sit on the leather stools at the bar, and then go back about fourteen more times to sit out on the patio. Seriously - go check out the patio. It is EXACTLY what a Patio Hangout Bar should be. EXACTLY. Caroline and I told the hostesses we were only there for drinks, so we were seated in the bar area in some fabulous leather club chairs. It wasnt initmate, but we werent looking for intimate. And speaking of the bar, even though V95 advertises itself as a wine bar, they DO have booze. Im not much of a wine drinker and was very pleased to see that they carried a pretty good selection of single malt scotches. Not an overwhelming selection, but well beyond the normal Glenfiddich /Glenlivit /GlenMorangie trio to which most places are limited. I had a couple of drums of Ardbeg, which is one of my new favorites and very reasonably priced at retail. (Scotch is never reasonably priced in restaurants, but I was celebrating so I didnt care.) Caroline had her normal ""vodka martini extra dirty extra cold"" which she judged to have ""perfect dirtiness"", (no wonder I love her!), perfect amount of olives and very cold.  The limited Happy Hour menu had some very interesting choices. We settled on the bruschetta and the smoked tomato bisque. The bruschetta was VERY nice and quite unusual. You get to select four of eight choices for your bruschetta platter; we picked: (1) white bean and pancetta, (2) gravlax, caper goat cheese and pickled onions, (3) fig chutney, ricotta and prosciutto, (4) brie, pear and onion jam. They were all served cold, in nice sized portions and the flavors were all nicely balanced and very interesting. Caroline would have preferred the bread to not be so crispy, but I really liked it. The tomato bisque  was creamy, smoky and had well-balanced flavor. Caroline said it was unique and I say it was just darn delicious.  Things being as they are, drinks and appetizers turned into food. A friend had told us ""you have to try the Vintage burger"", so we did. It came served with a mixture of regular and sweet potato fries, all nicely cooked and nicely seasoned. Recommended. The burger was VERY tasty. They obviously use good beef, the bun was fresh, the fixins were tasty. HIGHLY recommended. In for a dime, in for a dollar, right? So we ordered dessert. Again, the dessert menu is short, but Im okay with that as long as they do it well. Chocolate torte with hazelnut gelato, apple pie with carmel sauce and creme fraiche gelato, and something else we couldnt remember. Im allergic to hazelnut and dont like sweet desserts, so we decided to try the apple pie. Like everything else we had sampled, the apple pie was unusual - you wouldnt find it anywhere else. It was served on a freshly baked puff pastry, cubed apples served on top and inside - tender but not mushy -  with lots of cinnamon and sugar, plate was swirled with salted dolce la leche. It was tasty, but instead of the expected creme fraiche gelato, we were served hazelnut gelato. I didnt realize it was hazelnut until Id had a couple of bites and my throat started to swell up. At this point that the night could have turned into a disaster, but to their credit - it didnt. We told the waiter who told the manager, (Gavin - one of the owners), who immediately came and asked if I needed emergency assistance. I didnt, Im not THAT allergic.)  Frankly, their response was EXACTLY the kind of customer service you want to see. Anyone can make a mistake, so no harm, no foul. But I must give BIG Kudos to Gavin for his kindness, attention to detail and outstanding customer service. We will DEFINTELY be back and I strongly recommend you put it on your list too."
5,This place is an experience.  I cant stop thinking about it!!!  I love the weird odd flavors (Basil Lime?)  and everything tastes so fresh and organic.  Its nice to have something like this close by our house!  A true guilty pleasure.
5,"Let me start off by saying that if there were 6 stars, Id give this place 6 stars! ""Last Chance"" is simply amazing, but only to those true bargain shopaholics. There are days when the store will be flourishing with dreamlike items fluttering all over the place, waiting to be picked up and finding a new home in your closet. Other times, you must dig deep, and then come out with a diamond in the rut. I visited ""Last Chance"" today and fell in love all over again. I got a BCBG dress, three name brand tees, two casual dresses, eight hair bands, a adorable pair of earrings, FIVE purses and a pair of lace leggings for $39.00. And they all still had the Nordstrom tag on it!!!! They had so many things on sale (in addition to their already low prices). To truely love ""Last Chance"", you must have an open mind and realize that this is not your typical department store, therefore it will not operate like one, so get over the kids, crowds and messes, its Nordstrom stuff at below yardsale prices!! You must also be fashion and brand savvy. ""Uhh.. Darn diggity goodness mother of Betunia McGrittles, these scary looking boots with a devil pointy edge are $29.99, and they look like they have been tried on oh fooey pooey, that is just too garsh darn expensive Gurtude, And someone wrote their name, ""Jimmy Choo"" on it. Uhh, why are there so many  people ALL over the place, and grabbing shoes like crazy making a mess.. Oh goodness heaven no, this store is horrible.. Just like that ""Juicy Couture"" jumpsuit for $9.99 a piece up front, oh no another child making a mess, lets get out of here and go to Sears or JC Penny, they have such great elastic pants grandma jeans and they never have a mess there! I do not see why people like this place darn diggity.."" -Random ""Last Chance"" non-enthusiast. Key point, if youre not into brands and fashion, and are not creative and a bargain shopper lover, then you will not appreciate this beautiful place we are so lucky to have in Phoenix!! :) ""Last Chance"" tips.. (All ""Last Chancers"" will put a  hit on me after this, but I love my fellow yelpers oh so much lol) *Arrive EARLY. Anytime after noon all the goods will most likey be gone and all the damaged/ugly stuff will be left.  *WATCH YOUR CART! People will take you 25.00 pair of Coach wedges lol *Dont make eye contact with anyone! Dont trust anyone! If you see a pair of Seven jeans for 14.99 DESCRETELY grab them and move on.. Any sense of alert will beckon a herd of jean hungry woman and you will get mobbed! *Move QUICKLY, if you have to RUN! Especially if you are there right when they open, set your mind to what you want and RUN to that department. This will assure first dibs on the that sections finest. *Dont start crap with ANYONE! It can get really ugly.. and there is a wall of pictures of ""banned"" people from ""Last Chance"" and that is no where you want to end up in for ANYONE!

No woman really wears those sizes so they figure to just stash them there for a few minutes.. I cannot begin to describe the designer glories I have discovered stuffed behind a size 11 pair of Pumas.. NOTE TO EVERYONE: OVERALL, PLEASE BE NICE AND SHARE.

3,"The lemon grass pork is 2 stars on a generous day. Disappointing, since they tout their Vietnamese selections as being specialties. The pork was tough and the noodles were more like lo mein than the vermicelli type rice noodles I was expecting. Portions are certainly generous enough... I like that you can make your own rice bowl. Thats the direction I recommend if you come here."
2,"This is a club -- not a lounge, or supper club. I was drugged and dumped here by friends a few months ago (Fri, around 10pm)... It is too loud, too packed, and drinks cost too much. I am certainly not one of the ""beautiful people"" who belongs here... Good luck!"
3,"So.... our teenage daughter ran out of toilet paper. No problem, right?  Ill just use paper towels... for 2 days. Yeah, it was a mess and Roto Rooter fixed it.  For only $400.00. so then... they come back the next day to snake a camera thru the pipes. I think maybe they were looking for problems because well, they found them. Price quote.... between five to eight thousand dollars to repair some pipes. Errrrrrrrrrrr..... I dont think so. Did they do a good job with the problem at hand?  Yep. Were they expensive?  Yeah.... I guess Do I think theyre now looking for an extra paycheck?   What do you think?"
4,"Fast service, attentive waiter, food cooked as I ordered, clean restrooms...What more could I ask for? I was on my way to a meeting at the Marriott so I stopped in to grab lunch beforehand. I was in an out in less than 45 minutes. Perfect. Ill be back the next time I am at the Desert Ridge mall looking for a place to grab a quickbite to eat without ordering fast food."
4,"Youfit is always very clean and the staff is really friendly. Trainers are not pushy if you dont want to be trained. The only downfall was when I signed up it said unlimited tanning, but they have no tanning beds. All in all though I am comfortable there and dont feel like its a huge pretentious gym. I was made aware of the yearly service fee and which month it would be charged as well."
3,Food was good. Service was not good. Only one waitress for entire restaurant.
1,"My husband and I went to Ernies a few weeks ago on a Saturday night because it is within walking distance to our house and there is always a crowd so we wanted to check it out. We met our friends in the bar and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited. Still no-one offered to take our drink order.  The bartenders and barbacks made eye contact but no-one came near us. We dont look like hooligans or ruffians or anything so it was irritating. The weird thing was there were people eating in the booths around us, and one or two other people at the bar (who had drinks.) We finally got up and left. Why waste money on places that wont take it! I wont return and will recommend my friends dont either!"
2,"Since this was a little local spot I always passed, I decided to give it a try one day. The décor is so beyond needing an update, it needs a complete makeover. If you had Mr. Ramsey visit, he would say, ""Oh God...what were you thinking"". The location is great and I think that the restaurant has potential to do better than it is. The prices were about average in comparison to other breakfast restaurants in the area and the menu had a wide selection of breakfast goodies. The food was extremely average...I would have to compare it to the quality and creativity of Dennys. Nothing special, and for $30.00 for breakfast for two...I would not go back. There are so many great restaurants in the area and I like to support local business but this place just needs to start from scratch to make it great."
5,"This place is absolutely wonderful. My boyfriend and I have been here for a few special occasions and have never been dissappointed, the food is amazing and the service is just as good, our waiter was so unbelievably nice. Their steak could possibly be the best steak I have ever eaten, and their creme brulee is to die for. This place even does complimentary filet mignon sandwiches for happy hour...guarantee you will love this place just as much as we do!"
3,"Let me start by saying the crawfish ettouffee was the best Ive had in a long time! The food itself should probably get 4 stars, however, our service was just plain bad, so Im just going with 3 stars. The outside patio area was really nice and they had live music and a bar outside."
5,So many flavors and the ice is melt in your mouth soft. Add cream to make it a little better than a normal icey treat! Lots of sugar free flavors too! Mmm!
1,Horrible service. Twice now Ive gone there and they keep messing up my drink. I work for Starbucks!! Its not hard to get a drink right! Believe me. Horrible service. The people that work there All have bad attitude. One lady doesnt even look at you when your ordering your drink. I think that someone needs to go In there and fix it and make it a welcoming Starbucks that its known for. Ya a few of the employees that work there are absolutely wonderful but when you get that one that is just rude it just makes you not want to go there anymore. I stopped going. They still get my drink wrong when my mom goes to get coffee. Horrible.
4,"I go here often. This is my kind of place for a leisurely coffee and roll. Big, open, airy, warm atmosphere. Only downside is it gets too crowded. So find your own place for coffee, this is mine!"
5,"My daughter loves this place, unfortunately they ran out of money and are closing currently."
4,I told myself not to buy clothes at Macys since I did not have that much room in my carry-on luggage. Darn you Macys!! Why did you have a bazillion racks of clothes that was on sale!!! NooOOo.. I could not resist the temptation and bought 4 shirts for $60. I wanted to buy more too!!  I have a love-hate relationship with this Macys.
3,"Whatza Culvers?   I drove by this place as it was being built; didnt know what it was, but ""butterburger"" and ""frozen yogurt"" caught my eye..... so I decided to visit it on 2011-05-30 (dine-in).  Looks like it just opened, and it was busy. Turns out this place is a fast-food chain based out of Wisconsin that I had never heard of before... kind of like a cross between an In-and-Out and a Dairy Queen.  Menu is a bit daunting the first time - a burger or a sandwich?  what side?  smoothies, or regular drinks?  You walk up to the counter, place your order, take your number to your table, and they deliver your order to your table when its ready. The burger patties are different... theyre about 1/8"" thick and seem pressed/fried.  The buns are nice and soft... ingredients are fresh or properly cooked.  Flavors are there... but it is a different style burger than what were used to seeing.  I tried the cheese curds; just wish they hadnt breaded/deep-fried them.  I like my curds natural.  A fountain drink completes the ""value basket"" deal. Their frozen yogurt or ""concrete mix"" sealed the deal.... we tried the banana split (nice) and their ""brownie cookie dough"".  Kinda hard to screw up frozen yogurt!  yum!  Okay, so I now know what a Culvers is.  Its a good change-of-pace from the other fast food chains.  Not sure Id go out of my way just to come here (unless Im really in the mood for it).   Ill have to try other items, but for now, its a 3 star rating."
2,"Busy right after school which is to be expected...Wasnt very clean which is disappointing, especially for an ice cream parlor. We stopped in to try the new soft serve ice cream with sprinkles that turn the ice cream a new color. Dont know if the boy behind the counter was stingy or what, but the kids got only a couple of sprinkles that didnt even cover the ice cream which was disappointing considering they charge for them. All in all wouldnt visit this location again. We prefer the one closer to home :)"
4,"I went for lunch with my mother-in-law, she had the veggie fajitas, and I had a chicken burro with green enchilada sauce. we both enjoyed our meals."
4,"There are a lot of things I miss about SoCal and one of those things is the rich and ever present multicultural food experiences. So Ive been on a mission lately and I am quite the happy camper now that weve found legit pupusas here in Phoenix.  Salvadoreno is a neat hole in the wall joint that just screams authenticity with a family run affair and kitschy decor on the wall. We arrived early for the dinner hour on a weekday so there wasnt any other customers in there at the time. A little disconcerting at first had I not read the other Yelp reviews. The service was pleasant but the food out a little slow. Not a big deal since everything came out so freshly hot and just prepared.  With the four of us in our party we managed to try the pupusas in carne asada, revueltas (pork, beans and cheese) and the loroco flower (a squash/okra like veggie) with cheese. The pupusa dough was perfect and perfectly fried as well. The accompanying rice was buttery and delicious. The homemade tortilla chips were sinfully satisfying and the fried plantains (a separate order) added a fabulous twist to each bite of pupusa.  All in all we were pleased with our meal and I was even more pleased that Salvadoreno is fairly close to home. We will surely be headed back.  Note to self: the horchata here is not the typical rice and cinnamon drink youre used to from the Mexican joints like Albertos. Here, The menu described it as a morrow seed drink. Since it was not what I was expecting I had a hard time drinking it but it WAS good...just in a different way thats going to take some getting used to."
5,"This is my favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area. There, I wrote it...and I am sticking to it. First off -- fresh local, sustainable, organic are not just words on the menu and the website. Now, in places like San Francisco and NYC, this would be nothing notable, but in the desert, it is truly something hard to find. Aside from the practical, in the land of Fox Restaurants (True aside) and the big box store at the strip mall, there really appears to be little demand for a small, local restaurant on a farm. Its time to make new demands! Its time to say no to the next Zinburgergeist and try that little corner place run by your neighbor...but I digress.  We enjoyed the Farmers Feast and it was worth every penny of the $65/person. First, the house cured meats, including the head cheese, were amazing. Second, how often do you get a chefs menu where each persons plate is different? Not often. Ultimately we each tried 10 different items. And each item, was amazing. I would come back for the pasta alone, let along the perfectly cooked scallops, and melt in your mouth sliced fillet.  The service was ideal. If you want to eat in 60 minutes, dont come here, but if you want to enjoy in evening of great food, do come here. I noted to the waiter that the previous night they had sturgeon -- something I havent seen on a menu since N. California. I commented on how unique it is, etc...Of course, it was not available on the night I was there...or was it? When it came to our fish course, the waiter brought out sturgeon for me. The restaurant didnt have enough to have it on the menu, but the waiter clearly put in a special request on my behalf and made the effort to make a diner happy.  Maybe if I offer to work on the farm I can eat for free..."
4,"Eh?  How have I not written a review for Matts?  I went there a while back, but thankfully it wont be hard for me to recall the experience! Place - Small. Food - Fantastic. Wait - Usually. Bathroom - An adventure. We didnt have too long of a wait when we went, but that was entirely luck. Ive seen crazy waits here, which is just par for the course when the food is good. Most of it is local and very, very good. Service was fast, and spot on. The bathrooms are next door in an old motel. Apparently a separate room set aside just for Matts. Just one more stand out feature for a very stand-out sort of place!"
5,"So, for my date tonight to the Compass Room, I needed to get my nails done.  I removed my acrylics myself last week.   I read the reviews here and decided to try DV. You know, sometimes when you walk into a nail shop for the first time, its almost like the Soup Nazi.  Not this place! There were two girls ahead of me, so I waited a bit, but only about ten minutes.   Its bigger than the place I had been going to!  Really clean and I heard ENGLISH being spoken by the nail techs!  That was nice.  Yeah, there were still speaking Vietnamese (or so I think) to each other, yes, probably about us gringas, but it was refreshing to hear actualy conversations. I had Le.  She was so sweet!  I told her all about my date, too. She was quick, and made some suggestions about what to get.  Usually I like clear tips that they have to paint.  I was kinda short on time, so I went with her suggestion of white tips.  Plus, it was about $5 cheaper. She was quick but *really* methodical.   I think this may be the nicest set of acrylics Ive gotten out here in the PHX! She even called me by name throughout the conversation. $25 for a new full set.  Not bad at all"
2,"Came here on a Friday night to split some wings and a cheeseburger with the lady.  Well, if you want to split a burger they charge you $1.50 for this.  Hmm.  Why were my wings not charged an additional $1.50?  I understand their thought process but we were not hungry enough to order 2 dishes and waste food.  Also, for a sports bar on a Friday night, I expect beers to be continually full, not waiting 10 minutes in between.  Ill be back for the wings and for a change but the customer service definitely will be remembered."
4,"This is where I get my gourmet cupcake fix!  Love the cupcakes, lots of unique, delicious flavors!  The edible glitter just speaks to my inner girlie-girl and makes me happy! The coffees are great- I calorie splurged and had a Spanish Latte on my last visit.  It was the perfect sweet-bitter combination!   Ive only eaten breakfast here, but the menu looks great.  I love the atmosphere-very industrial meets antique meets country.  It can get a little loud, but I blame that on the rude people who dont watch their children and scream into their cell phones more than the business.   Staff has always been friendly and efficient!"
4,"I have been to this Mojo fro yo location several times now and really enjoy their yogurts! The yogurt tastes great, is light and refreshing and somewhat healthy if you avoid all of the chocolately/candy toppings yet they offer tons of fruit options. Priced by weight, a great stop after retail therapy at Saks or dessert after Stingray Sushi or True Food at the Biltmore. A must try, plus they have punch cards for free fro yo after a couple of visits! :)"
2,"I have to admit the quality of food here is better than your average bertos restaurant, However the girl who works the drive-through during the late shift makes some of the strangest mistakes with the food. Warning if your ordering 2 items dont be surprised to find them in one box combined into some strange hybrid. I honestly dont think she understands the word ""And"". This has happened to me several times int the last month. Always make sure to check your order here."
3,"Good flavors, fast service.  Love their green curry.  Great happy hour where appetizers are 1/2 off the reg price.  The downside is that most of the appetizers are deep fried.  I like lunch better than dinner as they offer a nice salad with the meal."
5,"I love Pizza-A-Metro and so does Joe Arpaio. I am quite certain it is the only thing we have in common. This is where I take my foodie friends because they are usually so busy eating they shut up for a while. (I kid, I kid...) I have never had anything here that I dont find super delicious and crave-worthy. The first time I went here my party was personally doted on by Maurizio, who was over-the-top gracious and seemed to truly love what he was doing.  While I dont see him every time I am here, the service never suffers. The calamari is crisp and light, which is a nice change from heavy, fried calamari that is so ubiquitous in too many Italian joints. Hands down my favorite item on the menu is the Frescolina. The combination of the arugula and prosciutto makes my mouth water even thinking about it! So next time you are at Pizza-A-Metro, my advice is dont loudly discuss if the portly man next to you is Joe Arpaio. Dont look him up on your Blackberry and pass the photo around to get the opinion of your fellow diners. Dont bring up that his mother died in childbirth, and how that potentially explains a great deal of the mans politics. No matter how much wine you have had, do not forget how small this restaurant is. Because in the end, after he and his bodyguards leave, the server will tell you- Yeah. That was him."
2,"Based on the reviews from some of the people, I would have to disagree. The gelato is not that great. Im a little perplexed by the near unanimous 5 stars. I seriously dont think these people in Phoenix havent ventured past AZ state border. Ive had gelato here, and I thought I was eating Coldstone."
5,"Have been there several times. Im quite fussy about where I eat and quick to condemn, so my continued custom says it all."
5,"If you are looking for top-notch produce and organic goodies then NGD is the best. Pricing cant be beat and its delivered as well. Always great quality, and a large selection. Easy ordering process and awesome customer service. One of the reasons I am sad not to live in Scottsdale anymore."
5,"This place has negra modelo on tap.  I would almost give them 4 stars alone for that.  The food here is incredible, very reasonably priced, and is mostly locally grown and raised.  Add in there musical taste, a mixture of latin and indie rock, and you have a place about to explode from too much hipster cred.  I mean that in a good way.  We live in the east valley, so this is a haul for us, but this is THE place we take our out of town guests.  Everyone loves it."
5,"Cafe Monarch is more than a restaurant - its an experience. If I had to put an analogy to this one - I would say that most restaurants are like watching a concert on tv and this place is like being in the front row at a great show. I was immersed in Christophers beautiful world and entertained the entire time. As Camille H mentioned, this place may not be for everyone. There is no menu provided to pick things from. This is not a place for a quick snack, although, I bet if you asked, Christopher would provide it. If you are a picky eater or have food allergies, call ahead of time. But if you go in with the mindset that you are going to be surprised with a meal full of the freshest ingredients, wonderful combinations of flavors and fantastic stories to every dish, you will not be disappointed. I am not sure I would bring my five year old to this place. She would enjoy it, but I think my husband and I will get most out of our dining experience with a babysitter. Since Christopher is a one man show - chef, server, host, story teller, etc. etc, each course takes awhile, and my childs attention span most likely would not last through the entire meal. For a description of the amazing food we ate, please see Camile Hs review. She described everything perfectly. This is my new favorite place in the valley. I cant wait to go back! Highly highly highly recommend this experience!!!"
4,"This place has a fancy exterior and you definitely pay for the ambiance. Definitely a sit down with a napkin in your lap kinda place. I have tried the tikka masala, pakuras, vegetable korma, and naan.  Its all very delicious and the portion sizes are bigger than expected.  Drawback: kinda pricey. Not a good place for cheap take-out.  I ordered out for 3 and it cost $50!!!"
4,"This one is consistent every time I come to this restaurant. Good flavor, good service.  On occasion the fixings selection is a little ""off"". Brown lettuce and those tasteless winter tomatoes. But the good thing about a burger is that they are still good wiht just the basics."
5,"I was impressed with this place. I had the Mongolian Lamb and an Asahi beer. It totaled $14.00 before tip which I thought was reasonable for dinner and especially for a lamb dish. The portions were very generous and even though I was starving when I stopped in, I ended up only eating about half of the meal before getting full. It was delicious. Tender lamb and a great sauce. The waiter was very polite and helpful and the food came out pretty quickly. It was very comfortable inside and the decor was tasteful. I did not expect that one of the best Chinese restaurants (of course in my opinion) would be located in Avondale. I feel bad for frequenting the Pei Wei on Dysart and McDowell so often when a non-chain place of this caliber is right up the road."
3,"Staying here in lieu of getting a real apartment.   Pros: There is someone making my bed. Location. Eye candy (they got something right).  Girls are smokin.  Valet.    Cons: I have a rental car but for nights out, where are the taxis?  You would think paying $250/night 5 nights a week, you would think theyd call one for me.  When I called front desk, they told I can catch one downstairs.  No, I do not want to stand out front in the cold and wait fot the parking attendant to holla one for me.   Very small rooms - No couch or real sitting area. And what?!  No tubs except for the suites.  No jacuzzi? Gym - is that treadmill falling apart?  No, its just someone using it. Bliss lotion (smells great but useless) - all this dry weather, I have to BYOL.   Room service (food and wine by the glass)...more variety please."
5,"Okay,talk about coincidences.... The other day I was compli-chatting with fellow yelper Jarvis about hard to find music. Today I run into a past acquaintence while out and about. How do either of these tie into a review of Boom Boom La Rues? Okay,follow along if you will. So I run into this past acquaintence whos apparently had a bit of a rough week.She tells me about finding this store in the middle of a bad day and it immediately turned her frown upside down. Shes raving about it.Then she tells me she has a yelp account and has added a review. I tell her I too have some reviews on yelp. Today Im in that neck of the woods and so I stop in. Holy hell! This place is a drag queens delight! Its insanely glitterific and there are beaded dresses and sequined accessories everywhere. Not anything I can personally do anything with,but I did manage to pick up a few things as gifts for friends. And none of it broke the bank. What does this have to do with my convo with Jarvis? A day or so ago we were discussing hard to find music and I brought up Nina Hagen. The sales girl in this store was a DEAD RINGER for Nina Hagen!!!! Flame red spikey hair and clothes right out of 1978 pure punk rock! That took me back to the good old days for sure. She knew the stock,was able to make excellent suggestions by asking specific questions and wasnt the least bit pushy. She was able to attend to  several customers at the same time and created a very social atmosphere for everyone there. For someplace I didnt expect to feel comfortable in,it was a pleasant surprise. While there wasnt anything there I would feel the need to buy for myself,I could see going back again and again to get gifts for friends. A great experience."
5,"Really good, healthy food.  Owner is super friendly. Would definitely recommend. :)"
4,"When I called to place an order last night I was put on hold briefly, however, this time my call was actually answered!!!!  When I walked in, the one girl at the desk seemed somewhat awake!!!  Keep up the good work Cantina Laredo! My queso and guac were delicious!!!"
5,"A hipster shindig- for day and night- make your meal with THE Burger au Poivre, Cobb Salad and best made cocktails around... One of the best places for brunch!"
4,"I have lived by Wallys for years and I finally hit it up the other day ravenous for some yummy food. I expect great things from a restaurant near AJs and the Arcadia crowd was definitely representing but I was still a tad skeptical.  We started with the calamari which was lightly battered and not like chewing on a tire. So far - I was pleased.  I then ordered the pesto caprese pasta which was soooo good. Im not big on Italian food but Ive always raved about it to like five people since I went two days ago. Ill go back and order the same thing - Im so boring.  Lots of other yummy dishes are served at Wallys such as burgers, other pasta dishes, salads that looked so good, soups, and they have daily specials like pork chops which that night came with a salad, some sides and dessert.  They also have a good happy hour. I believe she said all apps were $6 and beers were $4.  Wally - Im not keen on your restaurant name but I dig your food so I will be back! The staff is really attentive (not in a 5 sec filling up water way either) and really nice like weve all been pub buddies once upon a time.  Perhaps we were... cheers!"
1,"I just finished my G & S meal that I ordered to-go; actually, I just finished throwing it out. It was HORRIBLE. And by horrible, I mean shamefully bad. And by shamefully bad, I mean, heinous! I had a very disappointing experience here about a year ago but I thought I would give it another try. I should have proceeded with caution when I asked the long-term employees at the neighboring Blockbuster what was good and to the person, they all stammered and failed to reply. Seriously, zero out of four could give me one ""great"" dish! Ive lived in both Mpls & Chicago and my Ex used to travel the Orient and we were always surprised at how POOR the quality of Asian food was in this area and WHY the people here, seemed to like it!? Its absolutely baffling! I had the Orange Beef & Spring Rolls. The Orange Beef looked scarey right in the container. But when i ate it - UGH! The texture was all off and the sauce..... it had these big, clear, GELATINOUS, ..... ugh ugh ugh! I cant even talk about it. Like biting into a ball of corn-starchy orange extract! Im still sick from those few bites! [Truly.] And while I ordered vegetable spring rolls, I got what tasted like low-quality hamburger meat! In fact I finally identified the flavor and texture as: SAUSAGE! It was like an Asian Spring Roll with chunks of Italian Sausage inside!! Hows that for a combo? Ugh...... [stomach turning] Im sorry, Im a Single Parent and Im usually grateful to have someone cook for me. Grateful even when i am paying. But during ""tough times"" when i actually ""treat"" myself and then plunk down $20(!!) for unedible... yuck - its totally, TOTALLY unacceptable!  Shame on you, George, for offering such little quality control and not aspiring to a higher standard overall. No wonder the place was (not) hopping on a Saturday night! Simply one of the worst meals EVER."
4,"Got the chance to go out with the wife and WITHOUT the child, so we decided to go here after reading about Becketts Table in the paper. A lot more casual than I was expecting, but not necessarily in a bad way; I just assumed that being voted into the top 5 restaurants in the city, the place would have a touch more snooty-factor.  Kinda like an upscale, family restaurant if that makes sense. I started with the creamy grits and schreiners sausage trio.  I have to say it was my first time for grits.  Solid dish, I may prefer polenta to grits, but this dish was done really well.  Wife went with the brussel sprouts.  Very tasty, but strange to see as an appy - thought it might be more of a side.  Seeing as theyre not on the menu anymore, it doesnt matter. Mains: I had the Short Ribs and my broad had the Cast Iron Chicken.  I was blown away with the short ribs - they were indeed fork tender, as I didnt lift my knife once for this plate.  Great flavourful mash with the red wine reduction.  Truly a great dish.  Wifes chicken was great as well.  Smoky, tender chicken with the incredible stuffing. Bacon cheddar biscuits were ordered, but we had to take them home as we were both stuffed.  A little dry, but good the next day, however. Service was rushed in the beginning, as our waiter asked how are meals were, but was gone before I could answer.  He was in the weeds though as it was hella busy for a while.  He made up for it later in the meal. Dessert: wife had Nutella pudding and it was adequate. The coffee creme brule on the other hand was outstanding.  Thick and rich, and packed of caffeine.  Good finish.  Oh, and good cocktail menu too. Will return."
3,"A nice place to shop, but I wouldnt want to live there.  I never used to be a department store shopper, but recently Ive discovered that nicer cloths just seem to fit better. Go figure. While I still like getting a deal, I usually wait until there is a clearance or sale or some type. The macys at scottsdale fashion square seems to have more selection, such as more size options for the items you seem to like and a few more items to choose from also. For guys, I would suggest checking out the Dillards at fashion square; the mens dept is about the size of this entire macys store. 2 or 3 times a year dillards has an awesome clearance event and you can pickup 65% off clearance prices; which are usually already 50 - 70% off the original price. I digress; this is supposed to be a review of macys. If youre in the biltmore area and looking for higher end quality shopping go ahead and check them out, then travel down camelback to fashion square mall when they tell you the item you like is only available in your size at a different store."
5,"This little taco shop gets 5+ stars!  The fish tacos were out of this world, breaded and fried to perfection. I also tried the al pastor taco that was marinated well and you can taste the marinade in every bite. I also tried molotes for the first time. The cilantro salsa and red salsa was homemade and oh so good and spicy. The quesadillas are like cheese crisps. I am so disappointed that I did not find this place earlier since its so close to home.  I have to try the other items in their menu soon. Price is very reasonable as their tacos range from $1-$1.50."
5,"Scottsdale Fashion Square is the king of shopping centers in Arizona. Its unrivaled and it maintains its crown through constant improvements, expansions, and new stores. Empty stores are rare. Try that on for size, PV mall.  The food court is decent, but a wide variety of restaurants surround the mall, providing the shopper with an endless amount of stores, and a great selection of places to eat. Scottsdale Fashion Square aims to please the most critical, and goes above and beyond all expectations."
5,"OMG try their breakfast burritos!!!!  Habaneros has good, cheap, fast Mexican food."
3,"4 star service 2 star food = 3 stars. The bfast potatoes were undercooked and obviously microwaved, not grilled. The bacon was just OK. The prices are HIGH, both for the menu & the grocery. Wi-fi is unreliable.  When it goes out, it takes them 15-20 min to reset it. Great friendly service.  Nice, sunny outdoor seating."
4,"The Vig Uptown is on my list of very favorite places to go in PHX!  Ill keep this one simple: great food and awesome atmosphere thats chill, not pretentious, but still super cool keeps me coming back to The Vig Uptown.Sweet Central Phoenix vibe and location. I like it that this place is close enough to the Central corridor but also close enough if Im headed over from Scottsdale or other PHX hoods.  Happy hour is a great deal with half off all appetizers, 5 dollars for any burger and fries on Mondays after 4pm to close, and a stellar menu of comfort food thats still inventive. I adore the wings aka ""vings,"" the artichoke dip, the salads, the burgers, sweet potato fries,and anything Ive ever tried here. Other good things: nice patio area thats really indoors for hot PHX days, fireplace area, a bocce ball court, the fact that its in a repurposed 1950s bank building with a retro feel, and the Vig Rig: on weekends they will pick up/drive home if you want to drink a bit! Only knocked them a star because: sometimes the service falls off when theyre busy - Ive waited way too long more than once just for a salad, etc. If it was only once or twice I wouldnt have knocked them a star...but theyre usually busy and the service usually isnt very good. If they can fix that a bit, 5 stars for sure."
4,"Tasty food, great deals at happy hour.."
4,"With quaint accommodations, friendly staff and interesting selection of food choices, I was able to forgive, and forget, that the Centurion didnt yet have a liquor license.  The Centurion is a cozy (and by cozy, I mean small) place. But it has personality and I can imagine myself hanging out on the patio after work - in cooler weather.  For those vegetarians out there, Centurion offers a diverse selection choices. For our lunch, my companion and I split a Heirloom Tomato (with Brie) Panini and the Shitake Spinach Risotto.  Both were flavorful. And the prices are quite reasonable at $8/each.  The menu offers a diverse selection which includes burgers, pizza, pasta, salads (all around $9) and some higher priced dinner entrees (ranging from $23-$42).  I hope to return to try their dinner entrees, the blue cheese crusted filet mignon sounds wonderful!  I feel like I had fallen upon a hidden neighborhood gem. Im crossing my fingers for their liquor license!"
3,"Party of 7 please.  Do you have a happy hour? Yes, handing me a placard with 6 appetizers that are 1-2 dollars off..  Ok, give me one of everything, please. Im used to saving more than a dollar at happy hour but, the apps ARE good. Our waitress CJ then explains in Thai to my wife and daughter a couple of the dishes.  We order 7 entrees and they arrive in a timely fashion and were all quite tasty. Problem 1  The sticky rice which came with the pork dish was about the size of two of my fingers, should have been at least 4x -10x as much. Problem 2.  The rice which came with 2 of our entress was fine but, we ordered EXTRA rice and, that didnt show up until most of the main dishes were gone.  Even after asking a second and third time, it took 4-5 minutes for them to scoop it out of the rice cooker and bring it,  Not cool, guys. This is my third time here and it is ok but, 5 stars?--not."
5,"I cannot believe I am about to say this: AIRPORT FOOD IS GOOD. For any of you who eat in airports on a regular basis, youve surely come to accept the fact that airport food just sucks.  It doesnt matter how much you spend:  the bread is stale or soggy, meats are dry and tasteless, and forget fresh veggies and fruits of any quality. I was just shocked when I visited the Roadhouse at Sky Harbor recently.  I had an hour before my flight so I ordered a Stella Artois and a french dip.  I wish Id had a camera to catch my expression when I bit into my sandwich.  The bread was soft and warm.  The meat was tender and tasty.  The cheese was really good; no joke this was real cheese.  And HOT au jus?   OMFG I almost freaked out it was so good!  I couldnt wait to tell my server how pleasantly surprised I was.  She kinda laughed at me and said they get compliments on their food all the time.  AT AN AIRPORT?  Folks, this is the best kept secret at Sky Harbor.  I will make it a point to go out of my way to eat there in the future, even if my gate is in another termial!! This place is in the low B gates - try it and you wont regret it!"
5,"I love love LOVE this place. My boss (who is into healthy eating) recommended this place. I went over with some highly skeptical friends and one dinner was enough to convert them into believers! The food here is so good! We had the Shrimp dumplings and the Onion tart as starters. We ordered the Shirataki noodles and street tacos as entrees. So also ordered the Kale-aid. All of the dishes were yummy.  I have gone back many times since then and have never been disappointed! I have gone after yoga to get some Kale salad or the chicken chopped salad. I always have to get the Kale aid.  Once, a guy at the next table, uprooted a whole plant by mistake (on the patio) and was highly embarrassed as was his date! Ever since, I have very careful not to throw my arms around as I can be quite clumsy sometimes! I do NOT want to be banned from my favorite place for my clumsiness! I dont think I can live without True Food!"
3,"I wish I could love this place... Its just tough.  Ive eaten here several times and just havent really LOVED anything. My sandwiches have always been dry and kind of bland tasting. Salads have been ok, but I usually feel like I can make them better. Hummus - dry. Dolmades - tasted like the ones from the jar. Ahh, so sad, because its food that I do normally love.  Here is why I gave this a three- happy hour prices are good ($2 or $3 for small plates). With prices like that, I can forgive some of the food quality a bit."
4,"Great menu selection, food is hot and fresh and you cant beat the prices!"
1,"Goddess got it right.  This place is pretty, and it looks so promising.  Big disappointment.   There was nothing for vegetarians.  The food was mediocre at best.  Id choose Pho Nhat over this pretty restaurant any day.  Dont judge a book by its cover.  No good."
3,"First of all, I have to say you cant beat the price here.  $6 Pho, come on now!! However, I wasnt too fond of the food itself.  I mean, it was OK but not ""I have to drive 45 minutes just so I can come here to eat lunch"" good.  We happen to be in the area and Yelp showed us the way.   The spring roll was meh ... not super fresh but it wasnt unfresh either.  Hard to explain but I definitely wouldnt get it again here and the peanut sauce was actually not good at all.  I was really disappointed with the sauce. I ordered their meat pho and the flavor was good.  I definitely think the place is good enough to try but when we are in the area - which is not often - well prob find another pho joint to try out.  For the price and ""ok"" food, you will enjoy."
5,"Try the Chicken Parmesan!  Its the best Ive ever had? Quite possibly. When I worked in that area we would hit it for lunch once a week. Donna is awesome in a take-no-shit-but-still-take-care-of-you kind of way. She calls it as she sees it and I think thats great. By your third visit she will most likely know what you are gunna order. I cant comment on the rest of the menu as Ive only ordered the Chicken Parm. Yeah, its that good."
5,Pho-k yeah .......and the spring rolls too ........
4,"We moved here from Northern NJ where a NY style deli is worshiped right along with any big religion yet in our last few years there, all the great NY style delis by us were closing in rapid succession.  Going into NYC just wasnt an option each time I wanted some half sours and a knish.   It took moving to Scottsdale, AZ to find a solution - go figure. The gigantic menu youd expect, pretty good bagels, great breads, not to mention the grilled cheese/Jewish sliders/patty melt/kosher dog with kraut/knish/fresh chips/potato salad/macaroni salad - all are awesome.  I did not care for the Reuben I tried, however, I am crazy picky about corned beef and I realize that a true NY deli serves the meat a little fatty so thats my hangup.  Husband had an omelet today that could have fed 4 people - he loved it.  If you are going to Chompies with someone and it is their first time, force them to look at the menu online first or you will be filling up on half sours for some time as they decide. Great service, efficient but not pushy."
5,"I think I may be addicted to this place. This location is a  bit out of my way, but after a terrible experience at the Superstition Springs Buffalo Wild Wings this became my go-to place. All of the servers are incredibly nice and efficient, and my order always comes exactly as I ordered. Ive been here twice during the 2011 Stanley Cup finals and was happy that they had the sound on loud enough in the bar, but not too loud that you had to shout to the other people at the table. The food is consistently perfect, the atmosphere is great, and all of the employees I have encountered are friendly. The drink specials arent too bad either. You cant go wrong!"
1,"Yeah...notsomuch. Sprinkles is sooooooooo not worth the wait . Or the chaos. Or the hype. Or the attitude from the morons who work there. Other things that are terrible about Sprinkles include... - The cupcakes are not that great. I ordered two. The vanilla was okay, the cinnamon was dry and chalky and I really disliked it. - This place is a disorganized mess.  - There is no rhyme or reason to any of the ordering process. My friends and I were carefully watching the ordering process and we actually think they decided to choose the dumbest and most irrational methods to take orders and dispense cupcakes. Just stupid. - The owners must have purposely only hired people who cannot think for themselves or make decisions. No sane person could possibly work here without being like ""um...there might be a better way to do this..."" - Also, the employees were rude. Did I mention dumb? So get this: I attempted to order a bottle of water. I told the clerk its 100+ degrees outside, I walked there and Im realllllllly thirsty. The idiot at the counter told me ""You can order a water here but you must wait for your name to be called to receive the water and pay for it."" I pointed out that the water was RIGHT THERE and there wasnt anyone currently paying or using the register. Couldnt she just sell me a water? She said ""NO"" and proceeded to WRITE DOWN MY ORDER (just the word ""water"") on a cupcake order slip. She then told me to stand there and wait for my name to be called so she could HAND ME THE WATER and then ring me up. I was all sorts of thirsty and all sorts of moody that day so I got really ghetto on her ass and was all like OH HELLLLLL-TO-THE-NO!""  I said ""Its quite simple. Just hand me the water and I will hand you money. End of discussion."" (There are the actual words out of the mouth!) She looked really mad and also possibly terrified of me and my 54"" 110 lbs of fury. Thankfully she handed me my water so I did not have to stab her. Which was good because I was waaaaaaaaay too thirsty to stab anyone.  I must be properly hydrated in order to commit crimes of passion. And Im mad crazy passionate about my cupcakes, yo."
4,"So if you like to (seriously) cook or bake then this is the place to go. They have all sorts of professional cooking/baking goods that places like BBB will not have... Like the professional Bosch cooking tools (mixers, grinders, etc). I cant say much for the place as Ive only been there once to buy my mixer... however one of my friends is seriously into cooking loves the place. They also have cooking classes all the time and I think a lot of them are free but are subject to availibility."
3,"Mucho Taco falls closer to 2.5 stars-average.  The prices are very good and the staff was very friendly. Let me start with some positives:  the salsa was fresh and tasty as in these were whole tomatoes 5 minutes ago.  veggies on the tacos were also fresh and crisp. I had a fish taco & a carnitas taco-total about $4.50.  The fish was decent but the carnitas was pretty gristly.  I overheard the kitchen staff talking to a customer and found out that they make liberal use of the ""L"" word here.  Thats right, old school cookin for better or worse; Lard."
5,"Words cannot express how much I love the meat shop. I love it like a fat guy loves the place that sells him the best bacon he has ever had... because I am and it is. Ill be honest, it can be a bit intimidating walking in to the Meat Shop for the first time, if you arent a chef and dont know your cuts, you may be afraid, but dont fear just ask for help because the staff are excellent! Whether beef, pork or lamb, the meat here is always the best quality, and knowing its locally raised and by people who care about what they are doing makes it even better. And price? Ive never compared closely but I dont really think twice about the price here! Be warned! If you buy meat here, you will be ruined! You will never again be able to purchase that saltwater packed, antibiotic injected, hormonally treated, ammonia and pink good filled crap in your supermarket again! And that is a very, very good thing."
3,"Great sushi, not so great on speed. Cute place, friendly staff. Try the Vegie Goyza, it is great. Sushi rolls are a bit large for one bite. Asked if we wanted a Tea refill as we were leaving. Huh?"
5,"This is the BEST hit or miss bargain spot for everything. I frequently find great deals on quality body care products (be sure you know how to read the labels, theres a lot of low quality products in the mix), designer sun glasses, shoes, clothing, housewares, baby shower gifts, pet gifts, and guy gifts. It seems I go at peak hours, where lines are incredibly long. I see it as a small price for Macys quality at a Walmart price."
4,"I cant get enough of the Chicken Pesto with Feta sandwich here.  This place has a great sandwich for a reasonable price. My only complaint is that they literally put mushrooms on EVERYTHING, but, if you are a mushroom fan, live it up.  On another not, if you like fresh lemonade, you must get a glass of it here.  It goes great with any sandwich. If you are in a Pasta mood, The chicken pesto pasta is excellent."
5,"This is by far the best and most authentic Mexican food Ive had in this area of town. I try and get different dishes each time I visit and have yet to be disappointed.  If youre looking for an amazing location/view/atmosphere, this probably isnt the place for you. If youre looking for amazing food, then youve come to the right place.  The prices are great for what you get. The quesadillas are served on a pizza tray so bring your appetite!"
5,"Unfortunately, my birthday always falls right around Mothers Day.  Which means that every time I want to go out to eat for my birthday it is packed.  We thought wed celebrate early by going on Saturday, but it was still packed.  We called ahead and the earliest reservation was 9 PM, but the person on the phone said that if we just came down, they would fit us in. So we sat at the bar for maybe 20 minutes (IN YOUR FACE CHAIN RESTAURANTS!!!) and our beers came with a small appetizer of cheese and salami.  These people think of everything. And the wait staff is pretty damn attentive.  The hostess heard me say something about my birthday, which was passed on to the waitress so my super huge and yummy meal ended with a delicious dessert of my choosing.   The bread and relish tray would have been more than enough of an appetizer for me, but my partners in crime also wanted the spinach artichoke dip, which was soooo tasty.  My steak was SOFT but cooked exactly how I like it.  These are true professionals.  Asparagus was cooked perfectly.  The chicken pot pie soup was exactly what I expected and so yummy.  And the dessert?  Triple creme brulee - kahlua which tasted like a caucasian, chocolate which managed to be super chocolately but not too rich, and a mixed berry that would have been fabulous if I was a normal rasberry eating human. Yes, its a little pricey, but you easily get 2 meals if not more out of one dish.  Especially with the yummy bread and relish tray that is also presented before the meal.  The atmosphere is cozy and a little crowded.  If you are wierd about personal space, this is probably not the place to go. Overall: I love this place and go every time I get the opportunity."
4,"Good food, decent price and a southwestern atmosphere.  The food is decidedly better than the decor, but then again Ive never been big on the southwestern look. Something about Antlers above my head while Im trying to have a romantic night out with the lady just doesnt cut it for me.  I (like most everyone else) recommend the big ass burger. You cant go wrong with their side of mac and cheese either and I recommend giving it a go regardless of how much you fill yourself with all their other delicious entrees."
4,"The pork chop & eggs w/ home fries is out of control.  I feel the same way about this place as I do Roscoes.... you dont go for an egg white omelet, you go to just enjoy yourself & eat some food that your grandparents used to make the old school way, butter & grease.  Just too darn good to pass up."
3,"Service was faster than some of the other (but better) Indian restaurants I have been to in the area. The food was so-so. Nothing special. I enjoy spicy Indian food, but the ""hot"" was not. The only reason we ate there was the buy one get one free in the Phoenix area coupon book... no that, was a good value."
5,"This is my favorite coffee spot in AZ.  They know how to make a fantastic Americano.  They use very good coffee and a real European espresso machine.  I hate those machines that Starbucks uses with the coffee storage on top and the preset grinders.  YUCK.   The cafe has a comfortable and welcoming Vice.  Everyone will say hello to you when you walk in the door. They do have free wifi, but it is REAL SLOW!!  That is my only complaint.  They need to crank it up!"
5,"Great food as always.  The owner is incredibly professional, friendly and charismatic;came buy three times to check in on experience and even asked if we wanted more antipasto salad items(on an already generous, well-priced portion.)  The service is great.  Homemade breads.  Extremely generous portions.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to all."
4,"Blue Martini hosts ""Take The Stage And Be The Lead Singer Of The Band"" on Monday Nights. Usually there is a band that sings top 40 but on Monday nights anyone can go up there and sing. My friend loves karaoke and was dying to get up on stage and have her moment so I went for moral support. BTW she rocked! Most bars are dead on a Monday so I was surprised that there was a decent crowd here. No cougars in sight the whole night! The drinks specials arent that great but you can get $7 specialty martinis or if you go with a group of people you can split a bottle of vodka for $100."
2,"This 2 stars is extremely generous. Wanna know why? Read on. My party of 7 and a baby got to Pappadeuxs around 6:30. We were told that it would be a 30-minute wait. It ended up being more than an hour. We were standing right in front of the hostess station, yet no one ever came to give us updates on how long it would be for our table. We would go check about every 20 or so minutes. One time we were told that our table was ready. When we went to check on it after about 20 minutes we were told that they were waiting on a busboy to clean it. A few minutes later they were still waiting on a busboy. In what universe does it take a restaurant 30 minutes to find a busboy to clean a table? We watched group after group after group get seated. A group of 7 that came after us was seated before us. We ended up being sat next to them; by the time we were getting our menus, they were finishing up their meals. Once we were finally seated, we waited almost 10 minutes before someone came to our table to introduce himself as our waiter. When he asked how we were doing, we kindly told him that we were a little frustrated because it had taken more than twice as long as we were told, and we had been told twice that they were waiting on a busboy to clean the table. The waiter said that it was a busy night and said that he didnt get paid to deal with unhappy customers. He asked, ""So are you gonna do this or what?"" WHAT?! It was so rude - I dont know how he meant it, but it came across as sounding extremely annoyed. We were appalled and my boyfriend asked to speak to a manager. The manager came over and spoke with my boyfriend. Not sure what was said, but after that things got much better. The manager brought us an appetizer plate on the house. Our food ended up being really good - including the alligator. I got shrimp etoufee, and it was great. The gumbo wasnt so fabulous. Overall, everyone was satisfied with their meal. We got three different drinks, and they basically tasted the same: like cherry Nyquil. The food was good, but its not always about the food. The service was horrible. Dont think Id ever go there again. There are too many other places with great food and equally great service."
4,"I really wish that I lived closer to one of the Crackers locations, because their breakfast menu rocks! After a field trip to IKEA with my mom and sister we decided to grab a bite to eat, I knew that Crackers had recently opened nearby, so we stopped by. The inside is very cute, feels like you are in someones country home. The menu has a huge variety of breakfast dishes, sandwiches, salads and soups. On weekends, they serve breakfast all day!  I got the Carnitas breakfast skillet, and let me just say, they seriously have some of the best carnitas in town, no joke! The pork was so tender; covered with jack cheese on a bed of potatoes, heaven! My sister got the BLT, and they were not skimpy on the bacon! I have had some of their soups before, and lets just say, the Cream of Spinach & Artichoke is like heaven in a bowl! So rich, and creamy, it is like eating dip without the chips!  They are only open until 2:00, but it is great spot to grab a bite to eat for breakfast or lunch!"
2,"We went there for dinner in April 2011. The dishes are hit and miss, and all are over priced. My wife ordered pad thai, and it was horrible. Instead of the traditional, flavorful dish with peanut and bean sprout, this dish at Flos is just a salty, chicken noodle. My wife and I both took a bite, we had to send it back. It was not edible. Too salty. Only chicken and rice noodle. There was no peanut, no bean sprout, no pepper, no egg, no ..... Basically, it was NOT a pad thai at all.  On the upside, my son ordered a sweet&sour chicken, and it was better than most places. They used fresh pineapples. Based on food quality, ambience, and dinner prices, I say there are tons of other places that are better."
5,"Went here for our anniversary.  Pretty much what you would expect from an upper end steak house.  Yes, its pricey.  Steaks were good and service was attentive.  A good place to celebrate."
4,"I found this place whilst trying to find good mac and cheese places on yelp. Ill be honest, I love my wine and I love my cheese. Bonus points if its melted over mac. And they do great mac and cheese. Some better than others- my favorite so far has actually been the spinach and pesto. If you want the chorizo, I say pass. The spinach or the bacon is much better. If youre into bleu cheese, the bleu cheese mac is VERY bleu. Take that for what its worth.  Thats not all they do either. Their entrees are consistently great. My boyfriend got some scallops that were incredible, though I dont think its on their menu now. Their wines are great too. Ill be honest, Im no connoisseur, but they had a moscato from Israel that the bf still drools over. Its enough that the next time I was there I picked up a whole bottle, just for him. Ive also had one of their mojitos and that was great as well. As a note- if youre in for happy hour and get a cheese plate... I really do think its better to splurge and get a regular cheese plate. I got a happy hour cheese plate, and its... miniscule. All of the stuff that made their non happy hour cheese plate awesome was diminished. 1 cheese instead of 3. No boursin. Fewer crackers. Less of that fantastic orange blossom honey and apples. You get my drift.  Definitely a must try. Service is great and attentive, and its always been nice and quiet when I went in."
2,"I must have looked like a poor, ugly person the other day bc seriously NO ONE helped me. no one even said hi. I was in there for an hour too.  I decided not to buy anything bc the service was so bad.  this is a little bit like OJs ""i didnt kill my wife, but if I did this is how I would do it"" in that if someone had helped me I would have bought 6 place settings- mats, chargers, napkins and napkin rings. I also would have bought several drapery panels.  but no way was I going to spend that much money at a place that couldnt even say hello or ask a girl carrying around a ton of place settings if she needed help.  so i just set everything I had gathered up over the hour in a pile and left. youre welcome employees, hope you had fun putting everything away. i also hope they work on commission and are regretting not saying hi to me."
5,"Best pizza in AZ, hands down."
4,"The food here is consistently good. We tend to come here annually at Christmastime while shopping at the mall. Went last week with the ladies and had the ultimate food envy watching my cohort eat a chicken salad sandwich. Came back this week to test it out and it is the BEST chicken salad sandwich I have ever eaten. May have to add this to my rotation of dining spots.  My other dining mates had  the Shepards Pie, which was delicious and the grilled fish tacos which were also exceptional. I always have a sense of trepidation when I pore over the such an extensive menu. But 3 out of 3 dishes were a winner. Yet another chain with multiple locations in the valley."
4,"Love sitting at the sushi bar, the chefs are always super friendly and really fun to watch. The urchin with the quail egg is a MUST for all you sushi lovers."
4,"Stopped in last night for a take out dinner. I wanted to bring home something different than burgers or a pizza or fried chicken. So I used my Yelp app.... And showed Yusefs nearby with good reviews. The owner was a very personable person....and very helpful. Everything smelled wonderful, and it was pretty busy....all good signs. I order 2 of the falafel dinner plates, and the stuffed grape leaves plate. The only ""side"" for a dinner plate was the split pea soup. It was a generous portion....and VERY GOOD! The falafel and grape leave were both generous portions....and delicious! I want to go back a do a little grocery shopping for some of the unique items that I think you could find only in Phoenix here. Good job Yusef! I liked it!"
4,"El Paso currently has some recession specials that lower the price of several entrees. I got the brisket platter for $9 (reg. $13) and it was plenty of food for a good price. The brisket was juicy while hot, although when it cools it gets drier. I should eat faster next time! The brisket also had a very dark pink smoke ring and good smoky flavor. the bbq sauces are good but nothing special. The platters come with 2 side dishes and I was pleasantly surprised that the veggies were not boiled to death. The carrot strips were just the right tenderness and sweet, and the broccoli was slightly crunchy. My other side dish was the sweet potato fries. They were good and went well with the BBQ sauce. For the price, Id definitely go back to try some of their other meats. Side note - I dont know why, but all of the tables around us were filled with elderly people. Does El Paso put coupons in AARP magazines?"
5,"Im happy to say that Ive incorporated Guedos into my weekly routine.  The food is excellent and the atmosphere is spot-on. Ive read several reviews where people complained about the food being overpriced but I really dont mind paying a little extra when it comes supporting local businesses; especially a staple of the community like Guedos.  If youre looking for a place with awesome food and an owner who cares to learn your name, come to Guedos."
4,"We tried The Turf for breakfast this weekend.  We were definitely not in the mood to wait a lifetime for Matts after perusing the market, so we decided to head over to the Turf.  As expected, the place was empty except for one guy at the bar... considering it was like 9 am I am really hoping this guy was just drinking apple juice.  Our server was very nice, and I am pretty sure we had her on our first night here.  After explaining to us what black and white pudding was, ewww, and then running away, she came back for our breakfast order.  I got the Bacon and Cheese Omelet and the husband got Biscuits and Gravy.  My breakfast was served with hashbrowns and toast.  The hashbrowns were thin and crispy, just the way I like it.  My omelet was stuffed to the max with bacon and oozing melty cheese.  It wasnt a big fluffy omelet like at IHOP but it was a dense solid little guy.  I much prefer my omelets to be like this.  The husband was a little less than pleased with his meal.  We both agreed the gravy was pretty good and we really liked that there was actually sausage in it, the way it should be.  The disappointment was definitely in the biscuits though.  They were certainly not fresh and definitely not homemade.  Considering how easy and quick biscuits are to make, this bummed me out.  To the owner of Turf:  If you want me to, I will be more than happy to come over and show you how to make a good biscuit.  If there are good, fresh biscuits, this could be a great dish.  Not the best for breakfast, but a good alternative for when we dont feel like waiting for hours in the hot morning sun."
4,"I have only been to this theater once.  I was hanging out with some girlfriends and this is the closest theater to where they live.  At first glance, it looks like a typical movie theater.  For the most part it is.  The thing that I found awesome, was that it has a daycare center.  If a couple wants to go to a movie and its not appropriate for the child or they just want to do something for the two of them, they can bring their little one to the day care center.  I cant believe all the parents, who bring their kids to adult movies.  Its unacceptable and of course selfish of the parents.  I hope other theaters catch on to this.   Its also right next to Buffalo Wild Wings and several shops and other restaurants in the area.  Check it out."
4,"I love this place!  Great quality food, great service, large portions and fare prices.  In the Frys parking lot.  Try the bbq pork egg foo young, mongolian beef and get the lo mein instead of rice.  Good stuff."
3,"Sometimes you CAN judge a book by its cover. This looks like a typical diner and indeed thats what it was. Even though the place was busy (Sunday breakfast time) I was immediately seated, the servers were friendly and everyone used the obligatory ""hon"" when addressing you, and the food came fast in spite of the busy time. Taste and quality of the food were typical for a diner - OK, not great, but the pancakes were definitely more than I could finish. Not as inexpensive as I though it would be: pancakes (3) with bacon and eggs and a cup of coffee came to a few cents short of 10 bucks! Very casual atmosphere: most of the folks here were attired like they were about to do some home gardening after breakfast."
5,"I really love this place. Im not sure why there are so many mixed reviews... maybe what they ordered? I always get the regular size custom burger... blue cheese, mayo, lettuce, tomato (and sometimes bacon). Simple and delicious. The rosemary fries with Smash sauce are also amazing. The only thing I didnt care for were the fried pickles... a bit too salty."
3,Great place for dine-in and pick-up! Ambience: Contemporary/ Casual Food/Drink: American.  Good salads and desserts!
1,"Ive now tried Thai Elephant three times.  My first two experiences were solidly mediocre -- nothing was awful, but aside from one delicious dessert (black sticky rice with pumpkin custard), nothing stood out, either.  As a recent Bay Area transplant, I admit to being a bit picky, but in my 6 months in Phoenix, Ive found several places that more than satisfy my rather frequent Thai cravings (Swadee in Chandler, Thai Lahna in Arcadia, Sala Thai in North Phoenix, and, in a pinch, Thai Hut in Central Phoenix).  Until now, Thai Elephant hadnt really done it for me, but since the restaurant is literally 40 feet from my office and since other Yelpers seem to have had positive experiences, I was reluctant to give up on Thai Elephant without giving it another chance. On Friday, looking forward to a relaxing night at home, I called in an order for Pad Thai with chicken, Panang Curry with beef (extra spicy), and Spicy Eggplant with tofu (spicy, which I thought would be automatic given the name, but apparently wasnt).  I got home, meted out ridiculously oversized portions of the three entrees, and sat down to enjoy my feast. Wow.  I dont know quite where to begin, but to say that I was disappointed doesnt begin to cover it.  The Pad Thai was about on par with the Taste of Thai boxed dinners you can pick up at the grocery store, only less flavorful; marginal at best, but edible.  The chicken didnt stand out as being of particularly low quality, but the noodles were some of the worst Ive had at a Thai restaurant (some bites were underdone to the point of being crunchy, while others were seriously soggy). Sadly, the sub-par Pad Thai was the high point of the meal by a wide margin.  The Spicy Eggplant was a bland stir fry of soggy, overcooked vegetables and limp tofu.  The tofu appeared to have been fried as a large block and then sliced, and a few small pieces of eggplant were thrown in for good measure.  The Panang Curry with beef was even worse.  Though I ordered the dish ""spicy,"" the curry tasted like straight coconut milk with a few drops of red food coloring thrown in.  The beef was the last straw for me; it very may well have been the worst quality, most gristly meat Ive had at any restaurant Ive ever been to.  I tried several pieces, and all were similarly inedible. I really, really want to like Thai Elephant, but after the experience I had, I dont know if I can bring myself to give it another chance -- especially since Ive found so many other good Thai restaurants in the Valley and since the second-worst Thai meal Ive had since moving here was at Thai Elephants sister restaurant, Thai Basil in Ahwatukee."
3,"This bar is ok to hang out at. I think its sort of frumpy. The drinks are fine, Ive never eaten there.  They have PBR there.  Lots of local people mostly regulars. Anyone can go there an fit in there.  I have been a few times but its not a place I spend a lot of time."
2,"Was extremely psyched to try Lobbys, considering all of the great reviews, but I was sadly disappointed with the results. Im a freak for Chili burgers (good ones are very difficult to find) and The Lobbys Chili burger was fairly dull, featured Cinci style Chili (BLAH) and like. some sort of cheese whiz kinda crap.  Boo. Also ordered fries, and a Chicago dog.. the Chicago dog was overpriced and forgettable, and the crinkle cut fries were reminiscent of Del Tacos.. which isnt exactly a bad thing, but considering that Lobbys is supposed to be a tasty, quality burger place, frozen crinkle fries are kind of a half assed approach.. ALSO the amount of salt on the fries was enough to invoke a stroke! :x  Finally whoever dude was that handed me my bag of food was all like ZIPPY DOO I GAVE YOU A CUP OF FRENCH FRY SAUCE.. There were two orders of fries.. one cup of sauce.. which was just basic secret sauce.. not super great... secret sauce, to boot.. Thanks bro, but I dont need any secret sauce favors."
2,"Place is avg.  Sushi was good but the red sangria saki was bad. Service was sporadic and we had a one plate that they forgot to put the sauce on, and another couple plates they tried to give us which we did not order.   I would try to find another place."
4,I have been going here sense I was a kid! They have the best food that is not comparable to anything else! It is a must try restaurant!! I always leave pleased :)
5,"FANTASTIC little lunch/brunch spot! Went here with the family while visiting Scottsdale and really enjoyed it!  We had the Tuna Melt, which was delicious with their spiked cottage cheese!  The cranberry chicken salad made into a sandwich was DELICIOUS!  The omelets and scrambles looks great - I didnt taste, but then again, there was nothing left on the plate! LOL  Smaller place so could be busy during peak hours, may call or try and hit an off time. Service was ok, wasnt anything special but the food was really cute and made for a really cute little lunch spot!"
1,"THIS PLACE SUCKS!!!!!  It really deserves NO STARS!!! You can only like this place if you dont know anything about Vietnamese food.  What I tried... Bun Bo Hue:  Broth didnt even taste like Bun Bo Hue.  Spicy but has no flavor.  Wheres the beef shank or hogs feet?  You cant have Bun Bo Hue without the shank or hogs feet.  They use the cheapest cuts of meat.  This item was on their Daily Special.   Pho Chin Nam:  The broth was super sweet.  You know what that means....MSG galore!!!!  Not even a hint of Anise star in the broth.  How can you specialize in Pho if you cant even make the broth taste right? Service stinks.  I hate it when the waiter holds the bowl in such a way that his thumb is on the inside of the bowl while serving it.  The dude never refill the water, ask how things were, etc. Vegetable platter was not fresh.  Bean sprouts were starting to brown.  If you cant cook something why even bother serving it to customers.  I dont know about other entrees they offer but I wont be coming back to find out.   This has to be one of the worse Vietnamese restaurant in the valley.  Check out my extensive list of Vietnamese Restaurants for suggestions to better ones."
5,Andrea is absolutely wonderful. Shes pet-sit for me several times over the past several years and Ive never had a single issue. On her first visit she stopped by to meet the animals and go over details with me. Now I just call her to let her know the days Ill be away and she arrives without any problems.  Shes very responsible and trustworthy - her copy of my house key broke off in the lock and she called me right away and we figured out a solution. She even came by on a day she didnt have to in order to get it fixed - all of this while I was gone.  On another occasion my travel plans changed suddenly and she was able to continue watching my animals.  I highly recommend Andrea as a professional house-sitter. She cant be beat.
4,"The good thing about Pearl is their all-day everyday Happy Hour menu.  There are about 5-6 specialty rolls on there for $7 (regular price is about $10+).  I highly recommend the Fish Shticks - imitation crab rolled & fried in tempura batter, topped w/ spicy tuna and a sweet aioli.  There are also the basics like California roll or Spicy Tuna roll for $4.  I love their Happy Hour mini bomber menu.  Get the Fruit Bomb! - vodka w/ a guava juice chaser. Anyway, I finally got a chance to eat there on a Sunday and take advantage of their Viva Las Vegas promotion - you get 10% off and get to roll a dice and get an additional discount or other prizes.  WELL, after my cousin & I finished our dinner of Fish Shticks and the Deep V roll, we asked about the Vegas promotion.  Of course they would tell me that they dont do any promotions in the months of July & August.  Um, that wouldve been a good a disclaimer to have on your website!  This wouldve dropped 1 star from my rating, but I give it 4 stars for the food, mini bombers, & daily happy hour menu. Beware of service on Friday nights though.  They are terrible!  They forget your food orders & are super slow to get drinks.  I understand that the place is super busy on a Friday night, but thats no excuse for the waitresses to take their time flirting with guys rather than coming to check on your table."
3,Had a decent lunch here the other day with my co-workers.  We go here often for happy hour after work. The food was pretty decent.  The lunch menu is oddly full of mostly non-mexican style food.  That was odd. Service was ok until it got a little busy.  Then my cup was more half empty than half full.
4,Really fast and friendly service even during busier moments. The staff is also very helpful when asked to assist with using copiers and finding appropriate mailing supplies.
5,"5 stars? Definitely! Upon walking in, everything from the atmosphere, decor and staff was warm and inviting. We each ordered a 3 course meal, and agreed on different selections. The addition of a homemade mozzarella appetizer and an amazing dessert meant we each tasted 8 dishes that night. 8 amazingly unique and delicious dishes.  We tasted from every section of their menu, including raw (butterfish and albacore), cooked (gnocchi and risotto), and meat (short rib and pork belly). Pretty much everything was ""my favorite,"" and a couple of glasses of Barbara complemented the meal perfectly.  It was pretty quiet on the night we visited... if I may make a suggestion it would be to GO GO GO to Crudo. Like, now."
4,"We stopped by Switch the other night after getting raped by the IRS and while we were still feeling quite sad and pathetic.  We wanted something casual, inexpensive, and fast, and that is what we got!   Service was great!  We were one of maybe 3 inside tables and a full patio, and our waitress was fantastic.  She was very attentive and kept our drinks full. We had the wedge fries, a weakness of mine, and they were pretty good.  Not great, but definitely good. They had several vegetarian options, and I chose the Chop salad, which was SO yummy.  So yummy in fact, that I have been trying to duplicate it at home for days now. My husband had the turkey berry sandwich, which I didnt try (no meat for me), but he said it was good.   We would definitely go there again. Try it!"
2,"Things I liked: The homemade chips (mmm), the red salsa, the tender chicken pieces in my enchiladas and the service. Things that just didnt work for me- The green sauce was so blah I couldnt eat it without dousing it in the red to get a little flavor. The beans and rice were disappointing as well. Perhaps it is my lack of familiarity with New Mexican cuisine, but I was not impressed."
2,I agree with the other guys. The towels here are gross. Staff is not helpful. When i checked in there was no vehicles in parking lot. When I asked for a room I could park in front of because I wanted to be able to keep an eye on my truck they said none were available to me. If you dont get much business maybe you should be nice to the people who do show up.
4,"I live in a town where I can find 5 Filipino restaurants in a 5 mile radius. So when I came to Phoenix for work, I wanted to see what the Filipino restaurant scene was like. Like the previous reviewer stated, there are very few Filipino eateries. The supermarket that I found on my GPS was closed, so I found this one on Yelp. Overall, I would recommend to go to support the local Filipino restaurant. When you first walk in, you start in the bake shop area where youll find cakes and pastries on display. I wasnt sure if I could seat myself, but I was greeted and seated. There were two other tables filled with about 8 people eating including myself. What concerned me is that 2 of the other folks were the only other Filipinos - as I tend to judge all ethnic restaurants by the number of people of the same ethnicity. But that logic doesnt seem to work here were the demographics of Filipinos seems relatively low. I was craving Sisig (grilled pork - which is my favorite at Ongpin in South San Francisco) - but they didnt have that. On the whiteboard, they had Sinigang na Baboy (pork) - so I figured I couldnt go wrong with one of my favorites. Since I was here on business, I figured Ill order a few other things including the shanghai lumpia (eggrolls), Halo Halo, and topped it off with Hot Pandesal. The Sinigang was served in a bowl with 3 pieces of boneless pork. The meat was very tender and you can pull it apart with a spoon and fork. The soup was a little on the salty side since they may have put a little more tamarind mix, but that I might just be a little oversensitive about my sodium intake. I couldnt help but think that I was eating at home or a family friends house. Included in the sinigang was spinach, string beans, eggplant, a small potato, and cut onions. What was missing was dikons (those white radish things). It wasnt bad, and it wasnt exceptionally delicious because nothing compares to home made sinigang. But this would be the next best thing. I ate all the meat, and had quite a few eggplants left. The shanghai lumpia came out shortly afterwards. The portion was pretty large and I could have shared it with someone else. I didnt care for sauce that it came with. I wanted vinigar, but a filipino family came in and there was only one server. If you ever had Halo Halo at Ongpin, youd find this lacking. It is served it a large plastic cup. What was missing is the ube ice cream. In fact, there was hardly any ube in it. There was a spoonfull of the leche flan, but I didnt finish it. I actually ordered the Pandesal later, this version was like two very large dinner rolls served with butter. The bread had a fresh out of the oven taste. The restaurant section was clean, with standard fare dining. There was a large flatscreen tv with TFC playing. Last week, when I ate there, they were just written about in the local paper, but I didnt get to read the review. They accept Master Card and Visa, but not American express. I would eat here again to try some of their other dishes not because I want to support my fellow Filipinos, but because the food is actually worth having again. I took some photos of each dish with my iPhone, so Ill have to figure out how to upload them. This is actually my first review because I was hoping to read more about Philippine restaurants in the area, I only saw this one. So I figured, I should also contribute!"
4,"Decided to roll the dice on a Saturday night and try this place everyones been raving about. Despite showing up at prime time to a packed house we got a table relatively quickly.  The food was delicious and came out promptly. I didnt any problems with the wait staff like others have expressed. The presentation was a little more than expected without feeling pretentious or like I had to keep my elbows off the table; not that Im a slob. Didnt get a chance to make it upstairs but the main dining and bar areas were well-lit but still cozy and had a simple, modern feel. Good place for a date or toss back a few cold ones with your crew. St. Francis is definitely on my list now."
4,"This place is great!   Ive eaten here twice now and both times the food has been wonderful.  Ive driven by this place for years and it always looked closed to me.   The windows are very dark.   My husbands barber told him his customers (the barbers) drive all the way from Scottsdale to eat here.    We decided to try it out after hearing this and reading good reviews about it on Yelp.   The first time we went for dinner.  I had the Osso Bucco and my husband had Seafood Paella.   Both were great.  Ive had  Osso Bucco in high end restaurants that couldnt compare to this.   The second time we ate here for lunch.   Husband had the Philly Cheesesteak with Peppers, Onions, and Mushrooms.  I had the spaghetti and meatballs.   I had some of his sandwich and we both agreed it was the best Cheesteak weve ever had.  The sandwiches are loaded with fillings and are not salty.   Spaghetti and Meatballs were good but I like Babbos and Humble Pies better.    I would have given it five stars but the atmosphere is not the best.   Our first waiter even told us they do have the reputation for being a hole in the wall.   The service is very casual with no sense of urgency.  On our second visit for lunch our waitress told us she had been there over five years and they have quite a few regulars.    Both times we have visited the restaurant was almost full.    Try this place out even though it is a ""hole in the wall."""
3,"I have been to this restaurant several times.  I can say it has been better each time with the first time being absolutely terrible.  Why did I return?  Because I was with a friend who wanted to try it and I couldnt believe it would be so bad the second time.  It was a bit better and most recently it was good.  The hostess initially was very ""French"" in that she was affected and snooty and yes, a young American woman.  Initially we had a very bad experience with a fire alarm that continually went off, the staff didnt apologize and did not comp us anything.  Other diners just left without paying or waiting for their meal.  It has since been better, but I certainly am reluctant to return.  There are many other restaurants from which to chose!"
4,"Great breakfast, great service. Yummy!"
2,"My least favorite sushi experience in a long time . . .Ive had better from the grocery store in those plastic boxes.  Took an employee on their recommendation.  I guess its quite different at happy hour and the evening.  Very nice surroundings down to the fish swimming in the floor. That day it must have been a ""two-fer""  Sushi and attitude all for the price of the sushi. Rachel T. sums it up well!"
5,"Lux is a great place for coffee, bakery items, bites, and even cocktails if the occasion permits. The people are friendly, and it has a great atmosphere. I love coming here in the afternoon for a cup of their Americano, which is pretty damn top-notch. As I dont live in AZ, if Im going to be away for an extended period of time, Im always sure to take a bag of their freshly-roasted coffee beans from wherever with me. I was there last week on a Sunday afternoon having some darn good mimosas with a friend, and it wasnt too crowded. The only downside Ive experienced is it can be a bit confusing where to order for food and cocktails during the day. If you go for the first time, dont be shy. Grab a cup of coffee and explore. As one of the earlier reviewers mentioned, you might get looks walking in like you shouldnt be there. Maybe its your hair. Maybe youre displaying something thats not eco-friendly. Whatever, dude. Be brave, press on. Its worth it."
3,"Thank you, Mobile Yelp App!  Without you, I would have been stuck in Phoenix with no idea of where to find Thai food for lunch that was near a Light Rail station in Tempe! I arrived at Thai Rama about 11:15 AM.  On entering, there was no indication of waiting to be served and no one visible from the staff, so I selected a table and sat down.  My waitress came to the table and asked if I would be more comfortable at a 2-seat table instead of the 4-seat table I had selected.  Since there were about 25 available tables of various size, I declined and told her I was comfortable where I sat.  There were 3 other tables active in the restaurant, so I did not anticipate the restaurant needing my 4-top before I was done. The waitress set the lunch specials menu on the table and went to get a glass of water.  The lunch specials menu had 10 options available, but no Som Tom.  I asked the waitress if Som Tom was available and she answered that she did not know what Som Tom was.  She reached for a full menu as I explained that Som Tom is green papaya salad.  She handed me the menu and directed me to the third page for salads.  There, first on the list, Som Tom. I ordered Som Tom, the yardstick by which I measure every Thai restaurant, 10 spicy (5 makes my nose run, 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes), leaving off the green beans and shrimp, and jasmine rice.  Waitress asked if I wanted anything else to drink, but I said I would stick with water. Ambience here is pretty plain...and the paper napkins are not of the highest quality.  The decor reminded me of a formula-type restaurant like an Applebees or Chilis...with a hispanic flair.  I observed the chef as he came out of the kitchen and made a loop around the dining room.  As he walked by, I asked in Thai how he was doing.  He stopped and replied that the day was starting off slow, but that it would be busy soon enough.  Then, he continued back on to the kitchen after wishing me a good day. About 5 minutes later, my papaya salad was brought to the table.  Portion size was nice, about 2 1/4 cups.  I took a taste and evaluated a 5 spicy.  When the waitress came to ask if I needed anything, I asked for more chili and lime.  She returned quickly with red chili pepper and sliced lime.  I doctored up the order and fell to with a gusto.  For the price, adequate.   Jasmine rice was about a cup, and not too sticky.  The waitress was good about keeping my water glass full...and in Phoenix, that is important! On completing my lunch, I sat and waited for the waitress to bring my bill.  I saw no one for about 10 minutes, then the chef came out of the kitchen and made another round of the dining room.  He asked me (in English) if I enjoyed my salad.  I answered in Thai that it was not spicy enough, and I was surprised he was using red chili instead of Thai chili.  He chuckled and replied that Thai chili was a little more expensive.  I asked for my check and he said he would send the waitress out. For the convenience, outstanding!  For the next experience, I will be sure the chef sees me before I place my order.  For the wait on the bill, a little too long."
4,"AZ88, the cousin of Hannys, brings more glitz and better food selections than is Downtown relative.  My friend had a killer salad with buffalo chicken and I had a tremendously delicious burger with avocado, jalapenos, and salsa.  They were able to accommodate my desire to skip the fruit and veggie sides and go all waffle fries for me.  When I asked for dipping sauces beside ketchup, I got three choices.  I would only complain that their water glasses are far too small, especially for some of their spicier dishes.  I think the expectation is that you have cocktail to help you wash away some of the heat.  Speaking of their cocktails, the martinis, which I have had on a different occasion, are quite good.  This place definitely provides for an evening out and makes you forget that you live in Phoenix."
5,"everytime my sister comes to town we go striaght from the airport to Karshs. our intent is to buy bagels and we do, but we can never stop there and wind up with a variety of goodies. all that we have comsumed over the years has been really great. as for service, always with a smile and friendly attitude. we used to go here all the time when we lived on n. central, but since we moved to the other side of the world it has become a special occasion place. so please open one near us too."
4,"I was pleasantly surprised by Sauce. We went here for dinner last night, and wanted something quick, tasty and casual. Done. I think of it as a cross between a fast food place and a pizzeria. I had the Pepperoni and Crimini Mushroom pizza, and it was great. The crust is amazingly thin yet perfect for the pie. The center where the toppings are is a nice and soft but the edges are super crispy with a chip-like ""crunch"". The sauce and toppings were noticeably fresh and perfectly proportioned on the pizza. M had the Turkey salad, and she too was very pleased. I can describe hers much - as we both stuck to our plates! The waitstaff was very pleasant and everything came out well; however nothing really blew me away to earn that 5th star."
5,"i love, love, love the high level of customer service that paul and his staff provide at central car care.  i recommend them to all my friends.  good service, nice people, great prices, reliable.....  what more can you ask for?"
5,Loved my haircut. Walked in and waited for just a minute. The stylist cut exactly like I wanted and I walked out paying 20 which included the tip.
4,"Me and my best friend wanted to check this place out. We both enjoyed it. Here are my pros and cons: Pros: - There is ample parking across the street and the lightrail stops right by the bar so its very easily accesible. - The drinks are decently priced. I mostly had beer and they were all about $4 each. Bartenders were friendly, cute, and fast. - The music was good. I wanted to dance my little butt off. - The drag queens were fabulous. - No cover. Cons: - We went on a Saturday night and the place was dead. I really wanted to dance but there was no one in the other rooms getting their groove on. I was disappointed. - Its mostly men. There were a few lesbian couples there but its mostly gay men. (This could be a pro, depending on how Im feeling.) I look forward to going back on a busier night. From what I have heard, Fridays are the day to go so we will be checking it out another Friday."
3,"Im not really a fan of Jo-Ann.  They dont really do much to help you find what you need.  There are never any helpful people, nothing is labeled properly, and the fabric counter is always a nightmare.  This one is tolerable because no one is ever here.  The people that they hire at this one are just people who need jobs, not people who love crafts.  You better know what you need and where to find it when you go here because it is easy to get lost and there are no Jo-Ann Sherpas to get you back."
4,"I hate food shopping.  Okay that is probably an understatement.  When I go to a big market I am so overwhelmed and usually end up with a million things I dont need, while forgetting the things I do need.  Fresh & Easy is small, but it has most things I need.  I like that they have meats and chicken that already have seasoning on it and are ready to cook.  This makes shopping extremely easy.  I also really like their brand of food, especially the pasta.  I think its some of the best tasting store bought pasta I have had.  Dont go here if you need to buy kitchen supplies like cake pans or cookie sheets.  They simply have food, drinks, wine and beer here."
5,"Was in a few weeks ago and had the white bean chicken chili. superfantasticdeliciousness.  ive only had one meal out of about 20 here that i didnt like.  Wildflower is one of our favorite afternoon places to grab a bite. Thanks, Louis!"
3,"Similar to Los Betos - Fiesta is decent inexpensive mexican food. The staff is nice and accommodating. I did have a pretty hilarious conversation with the girl at the counter though... I was trying to order my burrito without onions, and she kept saying ""okay"" and ""yes"" and nodding at everything I said. I would ask her questions and she would say ""yes"" and press buttons on the register. It took me a few minutes to realize she had absolutely no idea what I was saying.  Aside from that, my burrito wasnt bad... nothing special though. The beans were from a can, the guacamole wasnt fresh (I doubt anything was), everything is cooked in or made of lard, their chips are flavorless and kinda stale, and they are seriously lacking any sort of salsa. They just have the typical generic nameless hot sauce found in these joints.  As I said - Los Betos... but cleaner and a little better maybe. Its just a place for convenient late-night munchies."
5,"I think that most of the negative reviews Ive read about this Golds gym really stem from peoples own insecurities. I have been going here almost 2 months now and have never had a single issue with the gym or ANY of its staff or members! I find the staff to be extremely friendly and helpful, and I was even offered a free personal training session when I signed up to help me get on the right track to meeting my fitness goals!  I read one review about some poor girl stepping onto a treadmill that was going full speed and falling off... who does that?? Did she not see the treadmill going FULL SPEED? Dont blame lack of common sense on the gym or its staff... Another review complained that there are too many gay men hanging out in the locker room. REALLY? As a straight male, I can say that Ive never felt uncomfortable, and have never been solicited for sex in the locker room. Get over yourself and your homophobia dude. Some yelpers truly disgust me.... Great location in a beautiful new area, convenient hours, tons of parking, a BEAUTIFUL state of the art facility.... what is there to complain about?? Show up, work out hard, and go home feeling better about yourself... thats what gyms are for!!"
1,"Einsteins in general has mediocre bagels at best, and their ""schmears"" appear to be highly processed.  Ive generally given up on Einsteins all together because because their food has really taken a nose dive, as has the service.  I stopped by this location recently because I was driving by and in a hurry, and wanted a bagel (theyre supposed be a bagel store after all!).  First, no salt bagels.  Arent salt bagels one of the standards?  Second, I ordered my bagel with cream cheese (cream cheese being a $1.50 option) to go and that was my real mistake.  Whoever made the bagel didnt even manage to slice all the way through the bagel and put an amount of cream cheese approximately equivalent to a pat of butter on one-half of the bagel.  The other half was basically dry.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I was pretty annoyed when I got to work and opened up my bagel.  Stick to any of the local bagel joints like Chompies or Kashmans - they have much better bagels, and they will dump a brick of cream cheese on them for you."
4,"Ive never had a bad meal at Z-Tejas.  My favorite is the Jerk Chicken Salad, but Ive also had some great scallops there.  The cornbread is always delicious, and theyre famous for their margaritas."
3,"I dont like mega-chain pizza.  I dont like Dominos.  I dont care for Papa Johns.  Ive never had Hungry Howies because frankly on their flyers it looks horrifying.  And I will never ever eat Little Caesars again in my life . . . but I gotta admit, Pizza Hut makes a decent thin crust pizza There were a few great locally owned pizza joints where I used to live in Tempe.  Tessios and Boulders On Broadway stand out, but ya know what?  Sometimes you dont want to pay $20 $25 bucks for an extra large 3 topping pizza.  Sometimes you just want something decent for only $10 $12 bucks.  Sometimes you really DO want a decent cheap pizza delivered to your door in 30 minutes or less The three years I lived nearby, I probably ordered Pizza Hut delivery or takeout once every couple of months, and Ive never had anything to complain about at this location on Broadway PS - the boneless spicy bbq wings are dangerously addictive"
5,"I just purchased a new Sorento here and my experience was amazing. Mike Bergesson was super easy to work with and got me a great deal. I live 50 miles away and there are 4 closer Kia dealerships, but I would do business with Salazar Kia over the others any day. Thanks!"
5,I was really looking forward to eating here this morning when I got to the restaurant and found that everything was super clean and nice looking. I had been drinking all night and it was time for some breakfast.  They had a great selection of hot tea. The people in my party got quite a few things and everything came in heaping portions. The French toast is the super thick kind and very fluffy. They also proved that they can really cook eggs well. They also brought lots of coffee and hot water for all of us. I also go their chicken tortilla soup and it was AMAZING. The service was super fantastic! I will definitely come here again. :)
1,"HORRIBLE service - did nothing to correct our experience. On July 7, 2011, my date  and I arrived around 6:30 pm, well dressed and ready to enjoy a celebratory dinner without any financial limitations. We would have easily spent $250+. Instead, after an hour of being seated  to review our menus we were never offered more than a cocktail. Tables around us were receiving quality attention by other servers...complete with the run down of the specials, house favorites, answering questions, etc. We, on the other hand, were lucky to have our make server look at us, much less take us to the next step our level in our dining experience. When the table behind us, seated a good 15 mins after us, received bread before we were, my date and I decided that was our tipping point and would not stay any longer. When our server came to ask if we were ready to order we informed him  we would not be staying for dinner  and would like the bill for the cocktail. Never once did the server apologize, offer what he could do to make things right, etc.  Needless to say, we were stunned. The hostess thanked us for dining on our way out...again, we both gritted our teeth with frustration. However, later we discovered that after an hour of sitting in the dining room, we were there long enough to enjoy a meal. Its unfortunate we never got the opportunity to, however. What did go right was...we were promptly seated and the cocktail server provided decent service."
5,"I found this place completely by accident and it was great!  I have been going pretty much once a week since discovering taco caliente. I love that you can choose from about 4-5 different meats and everything is completely fresh. .... Nothing is fried!  The service is good and the owner always stops to chit chat with me.  The salsa bar is pretty good and the hot is actually hot!  Love it!  Cant wait to go this week!   The only thing is that I wish they were open later but I know they just opened recently.  Hopefully, theyll extend their hours soon. :)"
5,There is something for everyone on the menu. Its more than pizza. The service is great. Get a table on the terrace and you get the view of the park and fountain. I will keep going back.
5,"im not a vegan or a vegetarian, i thoroughly enjoy sinking my teeth into a thick juicy piece of medium-rare steak. and i love eggs in the morning and chicken tacos at 2am. i am also very hesistant to try anything the attempts to substitute for meat, because i think its just psychologically strange. BUT ever since my friend turned me onto green about 2 years ago, ive had nearly everything on the menu. and never been disappointed or grossed out by anything. my favorites: number one absolutely has to be the mexi-cali burger. i could eat these everyday. it has the flame-broiled taste of a real burger and even the bright red color of raw meat, but dont let it freak you out. it also comes with hummus, bright orange nacho cheese, and chipotle sauce. this burger is SPIIICCYYYY so beware. their fries are crispy and perfectly seasoned. also love their soy ice cream treats, soy-namis, my favorite being the raisin with captain crunch. their lime-ade, lemon-ade, and teas are always fresh and delicious. i also love the diablo red bowl which is another dish for spicy-lovers and comes with fresh roasted eggplant (yummmm) and tomatos.  their pita chips and hummus are to die for. theyre crispy chips which i enjoy better than just a regular pita being served with hummus. and their buffalo wings are almost as good as the real thing. green nails vegetarian and healthy mock ups of american food right on the head."
3,"Yogis is a great place to grab a quick, fairly-cheap meal. I love the Arizona bowl - its a great alternative for you sushi craving if you dont feel like spending a lot of money. The quality of the food isnt bad. The sushi rolls are alright. The staff is moderate - theyve never done anything to impress me, but havent done anything to disappoint either."
5,"Barrio Cafe is a favorite of mine, the margaritas before you get seated are a must.  When in season the pomegranate guacamole is second to none.  A refreshing escape from the cookie cutter chain restaurants.  When you go go with friends and dont have a schedule as the wait can be long, but worth it."
3,"Fajitas is one of those places where you may go for an occasional, unmemorable lunch. Nothing is gross. Nothing is exceptional. Everything is just, well, there. Ive tried different variations of the fajitas theme over several lunches (chicken, steak, veggie, etc.) and they were all ok. Not a big fan of their tortillas, though. If you work anywhere near there, then Id say go ahead. Its a safe bet for lunch. You wont puke or curse the world. But is it a joint where Im saying, ""Dude, you GOTTA try this place out""? Nah. Youve had better fajitas elsewhere... 3 Stars."
4,"A co-worker of mine wanted to take me there because she said it is the oldest restaurant in town and walking in, thats how it felt.  This place is all about the atmosphere, its got  that  swanky kind of loungy,supper club feel to it.   The wait staff are all dressed in tuxedos but, were a little curt when we asked for extra things.    The food was pretty good we both got Chicken Giordano which was a little dry but had a good flavor to it.   The dessert we had was amazing, three flavors of creme brulee..great to share and a nice change to the standard dish.   One thing to watch out for is that they will try to sell you on their wine special of the night....dont get me wrong it was a great bottle of wine but, they push it on everyone!!    Great place to go if you are in the Phoenix area!"
5,"I absoloutely love this place.  Great Coffee, Americanos, and Lattes.  Try the Chemex if you are looking for something unique.  Very Tasty Breakfast Burritos and friendly staff.  I wish the North Location was still open, but Ill take their brews anywhere I can get them.  Skip Starbucks and hit up a real coffee shop..."
5,"I will start this review off by saying that I would normally have given this place 4 stars, but for a large dog-friendly patio, and immediate water bowls the minute your dogs butt hits the ground, they get the extra star.  We went today, a Sunday, and sat down next to people that had the exact same dog that we have (a female harlequin Great Dane) and knew that it was fate.  We sat by them, because they seemed awesome and in great company, the food flourished in my eyes.   They have a pretty decent beer selection, they had my favorite Sonoran White Chocolate ale and my boyfriend had something he loved on tap called the Bells Two Hearted Ale (but apparently its an amazing IPA). I knew Id love mine, he LOVED his. We had the Mac and Cheese, which was awesome, but not as amazing as others Ive had.  So order it if your a Mac person, but dont if youre not.   We had two sandwiches for dinner, I had the Acapulco Cheesesteak (UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!!!!!!)  and Seann had the RB&C (an equally impressive Roast Beef concoction). Those were both devoured with great beer and great conversation with others. Lastly we had the Triple Chocolate Brownie, per a recommendation from our fellow dog owner and it was delish.  VERY VERY chocolatey and too much food after an app, a sandwich and two beers, but it was definitely worth trying. Overall the food would have gotten a four, but the experience with cool people around us, and a great waitress really sealed the 5 star deal.  Now being added into the rotation.  Thank you Main Ingredient! : )"
4,"We are lucky enough to live basically right accross the street.   The food is great. Love the thin crust pizzas and the sweet potato fries. They grow a lot of their own veggies. They seasonally sell dates at the farmstand that are GREAT.  You get your food free on your birthday. Gets very crowded on the weekends! the dessert is just OK, but the shakes are great!"
1,"I brought my sweet sister in law shopping at this Forever 21 location.  She had a bag full of goodies (several hundreds of dollars worth) from H&M.  She stopped at Forever 21 and  sat her bag on the ground right beside her while she tried on a pair of shoes.  Her H&M bag was stolen during that brief moment that the bag was not in her arms.....and while this certainly was not the responsibility of Forever 21....we were so disappointed in the way the Forever 21 staff reacted. They did not call security, or the police, or even offer any condolences.  They just shrugged their shoulders.  My sister in law did love some of the fashions at Forever 21....but the store was such a mess.  There were clothes all over the floor under each and every rack.  There were way too few staff members working, and many who were working were ""socializing"" with one another instead of helping customers or maintaining the store inventory in a decent fashion. The only employees that were on task were:  1 at the checkout, and 1 at the fitting rooms - there was a band of 5 girls dressing one mannequin while the store was amidst in chaos (including someone stealing bags from other customers)..... So - if you choose to shop at this store - hold on to your bags :)"
5,My family has been going to Dr. Brittan for 10 years.  He is an excellent dentist and can handle any situation you can throw at him.
3,"Meh..not particularly memorable. Ive eaten at this location and the one by ASU, though I like this location better. I would probably only eat here if I was walking by and I was starving.  The cookies ROCK though, I like that you get one with your sandwich. And they have my favorite flavor of Jones Soda (Sugar-free Black Cherry) which kicked ass.  Warning: The roast beef sandwich (Overture?) comes with horseradish sauce and it is hot as a mother.  I like the spice but it was almost unbearable. My nose pretty much turned into a snotty waterfall.  Go to Opa Grill next door instead."
5,"I cannot believe all these negative reviews.  First Id like to start with the prices. Dont get me wrong, I love a good deal, BUT, if you are going to complain about how jobs in America are moving to China and India and not shop at AA because of their prices, then you are a hypocrite. AA supports US jobs and their factory is here in the states where they actually care about ethics and their employees. And, they have sales too, I have been in this store more than a few times and seen 30% - 50% off sale signs. And, on their website you can shop the sale section and save up to 75% if not more. To the clothes - I understand some people may be weirded out and flash back into the 80s when they see the clothes here, as I have read from the reviews on here, BUT, these clothes are actually very stylish and a simple top with a simple pencil skirt  from AA and with some accessories you have a fab outfit. If you are looking for something not so simple try a white strapless romper with their petticoat skirt, add some accessories, and your done.  The sizes - I am size 4-6 with curves, and the clothes from here fit me fine. I can understand the frustration if you are a little bigger and have had a hard time fitting into the clothes from AA. But, the good thing is that AA is now coming with XL sizes in some of their clothing.  The models - I love the fact that the models are real and barefaced. As someone who has struggled with a skin condition, I always hate walking around the mall only to see photoshopped perfect faces surrounding me. I always feel comfortable when I walk into AA. This store - I have never had a bad experience. Always a good one. i like the store, the employees have always been nice to me, I have no complains."
5,"I really (REALLY) like The Lodge so I was gonna give it 4 stars. To be honest though, I really cant think of any good reason NOT to give it that 5th star. Ive mostly been here for Happy Hour when visiting AZ, but Ive also stopped in a few late nights, and have always had a good time. The Lodge has one of the best Happy Hours (deal wise) in Old Town. All apps (except the mac & cheese and fried pickles) are half off along w/$2 cheap drafts, $3 Lodge signature drafts (which is a tasty beer) & $3 wells (stuck to beer on this last trip, but if I recall in the past they actually use a heavy pour during happy hour). Ive tried quite a few of the apps, and theyre all good. The pretzels & cheese are particularly tasty. I always get pretzels & cheese no matter where I am w/the friend I came here w/for happy hour the last time I was here so I can say Ive tried quite a few in my day & the Lodges ranks right up there! I admit Im a sucker for cheesy theme bars, so I kind of of dig the ski lodge theme here. the dining room area isnt huge, but is clean w/comfy seats. The bar area is pretty big & the patio is nice, weather permitting.  Ive never had an issue w/the service here & both bartenders & bouncers are always nice."
4,"Cibo doesnt appear to need my review, since they have a lot of fans here and other places.  This is a good lunch spot if you can get there early enough to avoid a wait.  The patio is particularly nice when the weather permits.  I work about five blocks from here and Ive only been there for lunch.  Ive wanted to try dinner but something about coming all the way back downtown after Ive driven home to Gilbert just doesnt appeal.  Maybe on a day off sometime.  The food is great.  I like the speck sandwich.  Speck, for the uninitiated, is just another kind of cured ham like prosciutto.  The bread is always perfectly toasted.  Currently they offer as sides a salad, fruit, or chips.  An orzo salad, a la Carlys, would be a nice addition."
5,"Recently bought a house and had issues with the speed and interference with the very many wifi networks around me. I decided to go wired so after I did a lot of research on how to get a wire from my second floor to first floor for the entertainment center. I bought a lot of tools from Frys electronics and then after I started actually looking at what I had to do, I realized it would not be something I can do myself. I called good guys electric and they came over and ran a couple of wires using CAT6 instead of the CAT5 I would have used through the (nail-ridden) attic and through walls without any wires sticking out while they kept away from the electrical wires to prevent interference. I returned the tools and wire I got from Frys electronics and that made the install very affordable. Im very happy with the quality of my network speed now, being able to stream HD content from my server upstairs to the TV 200 feet away. After completing the network-wiring job, I had them install a new chandelier on a remote-controlled dimmer switch which was done quickly and works great"
5,"I just celebrated my birthday at Oreganos.  I had the best server I have had the pleasure of meeting in a lonnnnng time.  ASK FOR ALEXANDRA.  Knowledgable, adorable!, attentive, funny, and charming to boot!  Amazing pizza and salad, fab cocktails wed never heard of, and to-die-for dessert.  All per her recommendations.  Cant wait to come here again."
5,"This place is as good as it gets for shooting.   I became a full member today after also researching Shooters World, Phoenix Rod & Gun, and Scottsdale Gun Club (where I will also become a member).   The cost is VERY reasonable at $85/year ($110 after adding the initial administrative fee). The club is huge (140 acres).   There is a main range for members and the public.  Then, there are multiple other shooting areas for members only.   You can shoot out to 500 yards at this facility AND you can shoot any weapon.   The only restrictions appear to be on the allowable ammo.   Im really looking forward to shooting at this club next weekend."
4,"Came to town for work and remembered coming to Thai Elephant the last time I was in town and loving it. Walked here with friends and the name had changed. The wait staff saw my confusion and quickly reassured me that the name and menu had slightly changed but the food was basically the same. I had the curry fish last time and was craving it so I tried it again and yes, still absolutely delicious. Tried the calamari and crab wontons as appetizers. The calamri was solid but the crab wontons were only okay. A little too fried and in a skin that didnt feel like wonton skin. The curries that came to our table looked pretty neutral colored and the noodle dishes, instead of being on the red side or the dark brown side was also very neutral colored. Since I didnt taste those dishes, I cant legitimately penalize the restaurant but I have to admit that I hesitate to order anything else besides the fish because of their appearance. Im still going to give this place 4 stars because of the taste of the food I ordered, the good service and the fact they had brown rice as an option. If ever Im brave enough to stray off the path, my rating may change. But in the meantime, check this place out and order the curry fish on their specialties menu. I ordered it level 4 - hot and it was just the right amount of heat."
4,"I went during the week with my two young children. We met a friend who also has a young child. Nice use of space. We didnt watch television, but it does have a few flat panel TVs that would be nice during football season on a weekend.  The space was child friendly - nice menu although they didnt offer crayons to kids, which they said they were in the process of incorporating.   Menu was huge and offered lots of traditional breakfast combinations. I had the waffle with eggs and sausage. I ordered the pigs in a blanket for my children. It is prepared with sausage that was fantastic. The perfect amount of spice and wrapped in pancakes that were also really good. My waffle was wonderful.  Really light and fluffy but with the perfect amount of crunch on the outside.  My friend ordered the French Toast, which was coated in captain crunch cereal (this sounds odd, but it was incredibly good and the bacon served with it balanced out the sweetness) and served with her choice of bacon. She ordered the applewood smoked bacon. It was excellent. They have five different types of bacon, including one infused with jalapeno, which I will try next time.  The service was a bit slow, but understandable given it was the first week of opening.  The staff was very friendly and attentive. I will definitely be back and would recommend to anyone for a nice neighborhood breakfast spot!"
3,"Growing up near this little hole in the wall, this place was a constant stop for my family. Its really good, greasy chinese food that basically tastes like you would expect it to. Now that I live farther away I still have cravings for their delicious orange chicken and chicken fried rice. If youre nearby during lunch try out a lunch special, really great prices!"
3,Very nice and helpful staff. One guys always asks me too many questions but I figured he was just trying to be nice. Theyre on top of trying to sell you a new phone and service. But when you shoot them down they get off your ass about it.
5,So my friend and I stumbled upon this place on our way to Barbs bakery but WOW I have never had a better taco in my life. The carne asada street tacos are freaking amazing. They also have the bottled cokes from mexico that for some reason taste sweeter than cokes bottled here. The waitress was also extremely friendly when we were checking out we asked how to pronounce the name of the restaurant and she started teaching us some Spanish.
4,"Relatively inexpensive, good solid mexican food place. I wouldnt drive 5 miles for it, but its a lifesaver if you live nearby. Better than the bertos."
4,Get to the airport early and relax with a nice drink and some tasty food at Chelseas Kitchen @ Sky Harbor Airport.  Good beer selection. Tasty appetizers. Wait staff is friendly.
4,"I ordered takeout from here recently...and it was delicious! I phoned in my order during a busy dinner time, so it was a bit chaotic and the food took a longer than they had quoted me, but it was worth the wait. I had the imperial rolls, which are like veggie-filled non-greasy egg rolls, and the pad thai. I wasnt sure about a vegetarian pad thai without chicken/shrimp, but neither was missed because the flavor was amazing. Definitely will be ordering food from here again--just maybe during a less busy time."
3,I went there on March 7th in the late afternoon.  My friend ordered before me and got a burger meal.  AND THE POWER WENT OUT RIGHT AS I WAS ORDERING!!  My friend ordered about 5 minutes before me so I got to eat some of her steak fries....the were awesome!!  Other than that not much else to say.  Gotta try them again some time.  The Nutter Butter Shake looked full of calories but delicious.  Better luck next time!
4,"Nestled between the bright lights of the once famous Graham Central Station and a no-name BBQ place is a lovely gem I like to refer to as ""Skips"". The bar side of this place is nothing too special. Dont get me wrong, its BIG for a bar, but the ambiance and furniture are pretty dated. So, unless you enjoy playing pool, I dont know why you would want to come here. That being said, the pool here is great!  They just got around 15 brand new Diamond 7 tables which play AWESOME.  Their 9 tables also play well, but they have some PRETTY unforgiving pockets.  So if you are a beginner, I wouldnt play on the big tables unless you like to be frustrated. They have no house cues on the floor.  you have to rent them up at the bar for $1.00.  This is great because they can maintain a better quality cue for you (if you use house cues). Their food is actually REALLY good! Ive had their Turkey Burger which was moist and delicious.  It comes with a nicely sized basket of fries.  Also, their Nachos are ridiculous good (Thats saying a lot coming from me)! The only bad thing about their nachos is that they use that liquid fake cheese... I prefer shredded blends on my nachos. The waitresses there are uber friendly. Yes, UBER! They always make a point to remember your name and they are always SOOO busy! Make sure to tip them well. They will remember you! Wednesday night is league night there, so unless you want to watch, avoid Wednesday from 7-10pm. Oh, and HH is from 2-7 and lots of the food (including the nachos and Turkey Burger) are priced to sell! Go shoot some pool!"
5,Love Love Love it. The Frozen Yogurt is only 8 calories per ounce. You can get your yogurt fix and still be healthy. Also they run specials if you sign up for the deals. Then they have a punch card program as well. My husband loves going there because he can still get regular Thrifty Ice Cream.
4,"Wow, I am kinda suprised by the recent reviews of this place. My girlfriend loves this place and has been going for the past 5+ years. She would probably give it 5 stars. I really like this place, the atmosphere, we always get great service. The food is really, really good and the prices arent bad. Sometimes, very crowded, but havent ever waited too long. We love going back and cant wait till our next visit."
4,"Yummy! Worth the wait. Yes, it is all the hype so get a drink, enjoy the scenery and munch on some fabulous pizza. Not one thing I wouldnt order. Have fun and have a slice for me!"
4,"Ate here kind of randomly on New Years Day, and it was pretty great!  I was looking for a hangover solution and the food here really hit the spot.  Great selection of breakfast items and friendly service.  The southern scramble that I had was delish.  The coffee flowed as readily as the wine had on the previous evening, so I walked out of Scotts ready to face the new year (right after the nap that I planned).  Also, sitting outside was some of the most interesting people watching I had experienced in years."
1,"This may be my worst dining experience ever. The scenery was beautiful, we cant complain about that. The menu was decent, there was a good number of selections to choose from. However the prices were definitely high, were just talking tacos & burritos here... I ordered a taco salad with steak. It was $11.99, for lunch...which I thought was crazy.  When I got the salad, it was the cheap iceberg lettuce, with a couple tomatoes & a few onions. The steak was DISCUSTING. I wouldnt feed a dog that steak meat. I asked the waiter for some salad dressing, he gave me this funny look and said ""most people just use salsa, but I guess I can get you some ranch or something"". Great service, huh? I asked the waiter about the margarittas, and he willingfully told me that the 3 cheapest ones are no good and are too watered down. Nice...so I then asked about the Patron Margaritta (my fav tequilla). The Patron rita was $16!!!  The waiter was extremely unprofessional, and even gave us this pitch about how hes only working there until he finds a new ""gig"". The prices were ridiculous! I would NEVER go there again and hope to share my story with many people before they waste their money!!"
4,"Since The Mission is getting ready to celebrate their one year anniversary, I figure its time for an update.  I went in for my first visit last November, shortly after they opened, and Ive been in countless times since.  The atmosphere is amazing, the staff welcoming, the food unique and tasty... oh, and the drinks go down easy too! The Mission has become Jareds second home - hes there much more than I am!  I go for an occasional drink or dinner.  My favorite menu item is the tableside prepared guacamole.  Its fantastic!  I am also a huge fan of the white bean puree, the street corn, and the salmon.  I wish they had some lighter options on the menu though - just a suggestion on behalf of those of us that are health-conscious! If you enjoy Latin-inspired fare, for sure go check out The Mission... Or at the very least, go in for a drink and some guacamole.  Look for Jared at the bar when youre there! I""ll for sure be excited to celebrate The Missions one year anniversary in late October.  Im sure it will be one helluva party!  It always is at The Mission!"
5,"Cashew brittle, almond brittle, bacon brittle!  Go now, before its too late!"
4,"I am glad I found this place but it is a bit far from where I am staying at in Phoenix. Their dumplings are really good, spicy cold potato salad was super good and refreshing but their green onion cake was a bit thick and starchy for me. I prefer Taiwans thin and crispy green onion cake. Really clean inside and it is fresh, full of Asians!"
5,"Dr. Dairiki is terrific. She is professional, listens to you and explains things so that you know exactly what she is talking about. I have never had to wait and the other thing I like is that she calls you back personally to let you know test results or if you have questions (plus it is done in a timely fashion.)"
1,"Cadillac Ranch looked really awesome from the outside, this nice red cadillac out front, nice patio outside, and an enclosed bar and grill patio on the side. Upon entering it was pretty dead, well, it was a Monday afternoon after all. I ordered the Southwestern Country Fried Steak, huge plate of food that came with your choice of House Salad or Ceaser Salad. I dove into the mashed potatos, which upon their many options of how you want your potatos to taste (garlic, cheese, horshradish, etc), I picked garlic - always go safe at a first time resturaunt! The gravy was very bland, I ended up putting more salt on it. The potatos were the only thing salty and flavored on my plate. They had also put diced garlic in the mix, not roasted, but raw garlic. I love garlic, but I cant eat whole cloves (horrible headaches) like some of those awesome people can out there, so it was kinda a downer there. The two pieces of country fried steak was actually steak, but the very fatty piece of steak that you should never buy, cook, and serve. Since I came with friends and family, it seemed the only thing they could put flavor in was the deep fried dishes. My mother ordered the Fish and Chips, they were slightly on the dark side, the fish wasnt fishy but slightly bland, the cocktail sauce was the only thing that saved the fish from being totally neglected lol. The fries were really good though! My friend had ordered the same thing, I think she wasnt complaining was because she had ordered mamosas lol. Service-wise, it was slow, but dont expect to be waited on asap on a dead Monday. I think the only thing that tasted good was the Ice Cream Fudge Brownie, but that single dish alone wont help this review get to two stars. All in all, eat at the other different eateries at Tempe Marketplace, I think Cadillac Ranch would be the last resort place if you cant get in to another popular resturaunt at the time."
1,"Found the doctor via his website and called for an appointment. The ladies that answer the phone are sweet so I felt I made a good choice. I was taken into the room and a sweet girl asked me questions and told me the doctor would be right in. He came in quickly and asked if I would mind if someone that was following him would be present. Fine. The other guy walked in along with a lady (medical assistant maybe). No one introduced either of them. Dr. Racette didnt ask me one question and didnt address any of my concerns. He seemed to even brush off the questions I asked or responded with brusqueness. It was very irritating as a patient to be asking questions about serious topics like skin cancer and feel blown off. He prescribed a cream for me and was walking out the door minutes after seeing me and said he would have someone come in with the script. He never talked to me about how the cream works or what it does. Awful awful. Too top it off, they were supposed to call me with test results. I had to call them and the gal that answered said, ""no one called you with the results yet?: NO!! Will not see this doctor again. Sorry but I actually prefer doctors that care to take the time and actually address my questions and make me feel comfortable, not take 5 minutes to rush me through an appointment."
3,"Went here Sunday for the Rockies vs Dodgers game. We got some great free seats just to the left of home plate. Love the awning that provides lots of shade to people who just want to watch the game from the top of the seat section.  I heard that the game was sold out, but it looked maybe 75% full. Parking wasnt too bad for us. We actually parked maybe 4 lanes away from the stadium. The food was ok. This place just didnt have the spring training feel lve come to love.  This really is too far of a drive for me and I truly love the vibe and energy I get from the crowds at older stadiums like Phoenix Muni and Tempe Diablo and even Hohokam and Scottsdale. This just didnt seem to compare."
4,"So we decided to come back and give this place another  try and it was  a lot better than our first experience!  We had the fondue first, which was more than enough for 2 people to share.  I had the chicago dog, again and my bf had a hamburger.  The service was awesome and our waitress made sure we had more than enough wine!  Looks like Windsor has been ironing out their kinks and really making it into a cool, fun space to hang out and eat!"
4,"4 stars because they dont take credit cards. Really? In this day and age?  Yogurt and shakes were good, but not the best Ive ever had, but a solid 4 stars."
4,"I have heard great things about this place and I had purchased one of those online deals to try it out.  I was not disappointed.  The only reason, I didnt give it 5 stars was because I was freezing.  But I had a small chocolate milkshake and the special of the day, philly cheesesteak.  My husband had a cheeseburger slider, chili cheese dog, and french fries.  We really liked the food.  If you want the sliders, make sure you order at least 3, I would say, because theyre kind of small. My husband is from Illinois, so walking into Chicago Hamburger Co, was amazing.  There is so much chicago decor, its ridiculous, but since Ive only been to chicago once, I liked reading all the signs and seeing pictures of former Bears players.   We will most defiinitely return."
1,"Seriously?! With grocery stores like Fresh & Easy, Trader Joes, and even Safeway around here, I wouldnt go to Whole Foods regularly, for ANYTHING, unless I was a bajillionaire. 1. Its wayyyy overpriced. Im not sure if theres a Central Market around here as havent seen one yet, but even that is better than this in terms of price!  We got a few items here, specialty items in bulk foods, for example. The wine and beer bar is cool, but unlike the Whole Foods in Austin, Tx, which was the epitome of awesome, (2) one cant walk around with beverage in hand here. Too bad the rules are so stringent about that, because if I were shopping with a glass of wine, maybe I wouldnt notice the horrendous prices quite so much. My 3rd complaint is that when we ordered coffees from the coffee stand there, my mocha and my boyfriends latte tasted like motor oil, after taking forever to be made, and the girl saw me swipe my card but THEN told me she ""didnt have a register person"" and I wasnt able to cancel the transaction....so then we had to go back through the main grocery line again. Grrr.  I left unsatisfied, uncaffeinated, and feeling like I had just wasted ten bucks on coffee that we ended up pouring out.  They get one star for having a wine/beer bar at all, but then I have to take that star away because the bar tender said they sold the most beer and wine of any Whole Foods in existence (I call bs - the one in Austin is twelve times busier and people can shop with their beverage of choice, and they have a bunch of restaurants there too so its truly an experience - it dazzles). This leaves one star for the supply of bulk and specialty items they carry. We went to Trader Joes after, got twice as much stuff, and spent half as much money. Sayin."
4,"The pancakes would be a 5, but the breakfast burrio would be a 3 and the breakfast torta a 4 so I averaged it out to a 4 star.  A very cute little place and you have to try the pancakes for breakfast.  You can order just 1 if you want, perfect for those of you with something else in mind but still have to try the 5 star highly recommended pancakes!!!!"
5,"Yo, this is my favorite AJs here. If you gots a beef with the prices then go somewhere else. Actually, the prices arent any higher than Safeway, they just carry better, and more expensive for them to buy, products.  They have been great to me as far as ordering Rambutans when I have a whim or a craving. The sandwich counter is awesome, and I love the slices of pizza that are as big as my head. The drink counter is stellar and they brew China Mist iced teas. Every once in a while the Prickly Pear flavor comes up and Im so so so happy.  This store is much larger than the Scottsdale/Lincoln location, and the service here is friendlier than that location as well. Shot out to Gerri at the floral counter, she is teriffic, as well as the produce manager who takes care of me every time. You guys rock!"
2,"If I had written this review prior to an incident in September it would easily be 4 stars. The bar tenders were awesome.  One night I was carrying around a largeish trophy (Why because I own one).  I put it on the bar to order beer and they asked me if I wanted a glass or if I wanted them to put it in the trophy.  Yes, yes I did (although they did have to pour the drink into the glass first cause the trophy was to big to properly fit under the tap).  This might not be a big deal to some, but since Ive been kicked out of bars for drinking out of said trophy before and that was the first time Ive ever had a bar tender be so cool about it.  Every time Ive been hear the bar staff has rocked even when they are extremely busy. Food.  I think Ive eaten here once, so Im not going to comment on it.  However I have been here when they switch from neighborhood bar mode to dance bar mode.  If you are at a table still eating at that time they have no hesitation moving your table out of the way, if youre lucky they will tell you about it before hand. Its a good place for watching football/UFC/etc.  Could maybe use some more TVs.  Music is nothing outstanding, its your typical dance/top 40s/etc that you would expect at any college dance bar.  Since the crowd often is college/recent grads, it fits the bar nicely. I dont normally include bouncers in my reviews, but after what I saw the last time I was there, its affected my opinion of the place and is the reason the place is only getting 2 stars.  If you are kicking someone out and the are leaving peacefully, there is no reason to put your hands on him, other than maybe to keep him from falling over the place.  So when I see a bouncer aggressively pushing a guy who has thrown up his hands in surrender, and in the process the bouncer knocks over a girl who has done nothing wrong, thats just not cool.  Maybe its just me but I would think someone who works for the bar should be picking her up off the ground instead of nearly trampling her to help the bouncer who put her there while throwing out someone who is giving them no resistence on his way out."
3,I decided to check this place out after getting a coupon in my Savvy Shopper magazine for 25% off. I am a fan of all of the little self serve yogurt places popping up but I must be honest that this place is no different than all of the rest. Be careful that you dont overload your cup or you will end up paying a lot by the time they weigh your dessert!
5,This is the best Cajun place in Arizona. The portions are great and the people behind the counter are really nice. I love gumbo and I have tried several kinds here and all of them were excellent. Yes the decor isnt 5 stars but seriously if youre more worried about mood lighting and soft cushions you can go to Pappadeauxs and get charged an arm and a leg for lower quality food. the drive and the price are definitely worth it for this place.
5,"So glad to have found great Thai in my neighborhood.  We thought when we moved away from Tempe that we had lost our access to great ethnic food.  Luckily we found this little gem.  Great ambience, friendly quick service, and fantastic food.  We ordered the green curry chicken and the drunken noodles with vegetables.  Great sized portions for reasonable price.  We got ours on a 3 out of 5 scale of heat and it was perfect for us.  I have a feeling well become regulars."
5,"This is the place for a fabulos breakfast!! I have friends who visit from Texas and they wait all year to eat the Eggs Benedict here. They are the best. I  personally love the pancakes smothered in bannanas, pecans and hot syrup...yummmmy. They also serve some very healthy and delicious salds for lunch like the strawberry spinach salad and the sandwhiches ar e very good, Their is often a wait for breakfast but it moves fast and their is a community table which sometimes shortens the wait."
4,"There have to be some considerations made when attending Frank and Lupes: First off, you have to understand that its not GREAT Mexican food. That is to say, its not real high quality, but more of what you would get at your buddies grandmas house. The second is that the service is somewhat spotty at times. You give your order to the ""waiter"", who then disappears as you are serviced throughout the nite by the ""bus boys"". Getting the check is the hardest thing there is.  Having said all that, this place is TAST-TEE! I cant get enough of their enchiladas. If youre lucky enough to be there when they are doing their Poblano Chile enchiladas, get them! They are amazing. The chicken mole enchilada plate is also incredibly delicious. And sopapillas??? WHERE THE HELL HAVE THESE THINGS BEEN ALL MY LIFE?!?!?! Drizzle some honey on these bad boys and enjoy throughout the meal.  Like I said, you have to understand what youre getting into with Frank and Lupes and if you can look past a few of their shortcomings, the food, atmosphere, and prices here are some of the best in town!"
4,"If you havent shopped at a Fresh and Easy, the simple way to describe the store is its like Trader Joes.  Only Fresh and Easy has a modern feel to it instead of the hippie co-op atmosphere. For being a relatively small store, it carries a very good selection at very reasonable prices.   The thing theyre best known for is the prepared meals that are relatively healthy, and only take minutes to heat up.  One of their best features is their reduced priced on perishable foods. Almost everyday you can get a great deal on steak, beef, chicken or fish thats a day away from its pull date. As long as youre not picky, its well worth it.  The biggest problem I have is with their produce. For a place with ""Fresh"" in its title. Ive notice that fruits and vegetables I buy from Fresh and Easy tend to expire pretty fast."
4,"Family-run restaurant that serves extremely yummy Iraqi food. Go up to the register if you want take-out and they will help you figure out exactly what you want. The cook is very friendly and can do extra stuff for you just let him know exactly what youre looking for. If youre staying in the restaurant to eat, they have fast service and its always served hot. Very good food!"
4,"Im kind of worried about this place. First, this is for the new location Downtown. I guess they have another one in Park Central, but Ive never seen it. When you call for takeout, they remind you of which location youre calling. I like that because some people are idiots and will probably go to the other one. I loooooooove the curried noodle dish. Ive eaten it in the restaurant and ordered it for takeout. The service is super friendly and the place itself is really nice.  Call ahead before going, though. I drove down there one night after checking their hours and they were closed. Who does that????? Thats the main reason Im worried about this place staying open. It gets a good lunch crowd, but they need to work on dinner, too. Prices are reasonable and on par with the 87 other Thai places Downtown."
5,"Holy crap is this place good.  With the gazillion milkshake flavors to choose from, I had vanilla....... kinda anti-climatic I know. Next time though.  The burgers were huge with 20 some odd topings to choose from. I had onions and pickles...... I know, another let down. Next time I sware.  Also the onion rings are tops here. Fries looked good too. The decore is a nice 50s diner type with very friendly staff.  Outdoor seating is nice when its not hot out and its very close to the theatre which makes it the perfect stop before seeing Mama Mia........ J/K on that one. Saw Batman."
5,"I love this place! I have been coming here for ages. My favorites: Elsas Chicken sandwich, any of their burgers, dragon chicken wings, chinas little chicken sandwich, and the hot pepper chicken sandwich. The atmosphere is always fun and the art they display is very abstract but totally cool!"
3,"We tried this place after reading most of the reviews.  I had rice noodle soup w/ fishballs, squid, shrimp & veggies and hubby had shredded pork sandwich.   Both were good and plenty of food.  The pork sandwich was so cheap, it was hard to believe it wasnt a typo.  Beats a Subway anyday!  The neighborhood is a bit shady but if you dont mind that, it is fine.  Service was quick and we will definitely revisit this place.  People kept pouring in during the dinner hours.  Cant beat the price!"
3,"Oh, True Food. I want to love you. But you make me feel like Im eating in a cafeteria. WIth such a contemporary menu and a staff full of bright shiny faces this restaurant is just a contradiction in form... the menu and ambience just dont match. My advice is to sit at the bar. The drinks are well served by pleasant bartenders and do their job, the stools are comfortable, and from that locale you get to skip the experience of having dinner with a room full of strangers right at your elbow."
3,"Sports Authority is like the Walmart of sporting goods stores. No, wait, that would be Big 5. I guess they are more like Target. Reasonable prices, and products that dont completely fall apart the first time you use them (but they are still made in China) and no service whatsoever. And Dicks is more like a Dillards or Macys because they have the higher end brands and employees that are older than 16 or 17 years old. So then I guess Bass and Cabelas would be more like Nordstroms? Thats where the really nice stuff is but you usually walk out without purchasing anything unless they are having a sale. Except Cabelas is sort of specialized so I think that would be more analogous to something like an Ann Taylor. Ok, I know I have gone way off topic here but I think I have made it abundantly clear that I am not a regular customer. But I do occasionally come in to buy gifts for family and friends. On my most recent visit, I came in, wandered around for about 20 minutes and then found what I needed (with no help whatsoever from staff), paid and left. A two star experience for sure but I have to give them an extra one since they offer a discount when you check in thru the Yelp app on your smart phone and so that saved me 10 bucks."
5,"The boyfriend and I like to do little staycations every now and then so when we saw a deal advertised for the Camelback Inn we jumped on it. We stayed two nights in just a regular room, I guess. They had several different kinds of suites (even rooms with a private pool!) but our room was a standard room with a nice patio facing Camelback Mountain. The room was spacious and clean, the bed was comfy and the patio was the perfect place to enjoy breakfast. Camelback Inn was much bigger than I expected. Lots and lots of buildings spread out over the property. Its not the easiest place to find your way around but at least its pretty to look at while you get lost. At the back of the property is a little ghost town set up. It looks like they do corporate events - cowboy cookouts - but nothing was going on while we were there. But we had fun wandering around the ""town"" and taking goofy pictures of each other. Even though it was December it was warm enough to hang out by the pool. The pool is heated so that helped and there are two hot tubs as well for really chilly days. They have an abundance of lounge chairs and even offer float rafts and fun noodles for the pool. There were kids splashing around but the area is big enough you can hide away from the action if you prefer. We ate at two of the restaurants while we were there - BLT Steak and Ritas Kitchen and both were fantastic.  We loved our Camelback Inn staycation and would not hesitate to go back - especially in the summer when the rates are low!"
5,"I have been going here for years.  The staff is always very pleasant, the place is nice and clean and they offer a variety of services.  I also like the $5 kids haircuts on certain days.  Overall, a top notch establishment."
4,"When dining out, I am a big fan of steak, and great service...Flemings offers plenty of both.   Having dined at Flemings on more than one occasion, I can confidently say that they know how to cook a steak to your requested temperature.  At these prices, this should go without saying, but plenty of chophouses still dont meet this criteria. All side dishes are a la carte, and on the large side, so Id recommend sharing.  The potatoes and vegetables are always great dishes. Mixed drinks are poured well, and not priced too crazy, relative to the entrees.  My staple, a Jack & Coke, was $7.50...Ive paid more.  The wine list is extensive if you so choose. Service was excellent, if a bit methodical...could be a bit more personal. Four stars instead of five, because everything is just done well...nothing stands out as above and beyond, especially at this price point."
3,"This is the FIRST Red Robin I had ever been to (earlier this year).  The service is always really good.  Good Veggie Burgers, love the bottomless fries (garlic & sweet potato), cool shakes and mixed drinks.  One of the few restaurants to stay open late in this town!!!  Great place to come after a movie at Harkins."
4,"This isnt a place that you go a whole lot - but BOY are they helpful when you need them! I brought in my cordless phone that has some special battery internally that was slowly dying to the point that I could only talk on the phone for about 10 minutes per charge.  Not so fun.  I brought the phone here and the guy was super helpful to find the right battery that would work.  While I was there I saw folks getting batteries for SO many amazing and unique things.  So if youre looking for something a little more complex than a Duracell AA, you should give them a call.  And even if thats all you think you want - if youre in the area you might want to go by because based on what kind of product youre using it for, I heard them suggest different brands/types of AA battery.  Not something I normally want to think about - but handy to know."
4,"My name is Amy and Im a comedian.  (""Hi, AMY!"")  I perform here about once a month and its one of my favorite spots to make people laugh. This is a bar.  Behind an ice rink.  The wall behind the bar is the plexiglass of the ice rink.  One time, while I was on stage, a puck hit the glass.  Freaked me the you-know-what out.  I thought Id been shot.  But I hadnt.  Lucky for you. I dont drink, so I have no idea about specials, whats on tap, blah blah blah. I can tell you this:  The service is amazing (and CUTE!) and the place is clean.  I judge.  I judge you on your bathroom.  This bathroom is clean.   The comedy show is every Wednesday night.  Its free.  If youre lucky, youll see me there.  Making people laugh."
4,"It seems totally unbelievable that, not only did I hang out for more than an hour at a mall, but an outside one at that in 115-degree heat. I attribute my ability to withstand these two unfavorable conditions to two things: Bonnie  Tea Infusion    It was Bonnies choice to grab some drinks at what she described as a ""great, independently owned tea shop"" located at Tempe Marketplace. Im not a tea connoisseur by any means, and I generally distrust fads (i.e., this silly-sounding thing called ""boba"" tea), but I agreed cause if  Bonnie likes it, its gotta be worth checking out, right?  Parking wasnt too much of a hassle on a Sunday afternoon, and we surprisingly got a space close to an entrance to the ""District,"" just outside of Barnes and Noble. Inside, the shop looked much like a Starbucks - and I dont mean to imply that it was uninspired or anything. It was clean, modern and consisted of a long counter behind which two employees busily hand-mixed tea and smoothie concoctions, along with a few tables/chairs.  The menu was extensive and separated into ""black,"" ""green"" and ""white"" teas, any of which I could get hot or cold...I think. I picked the tropics white in iced form, and B got my second choice, a peach mix white. Both were pretty delicious. There was also a selection of sandwiches and snacks that I did not sample - next time. I also ran into a good friend there who was delighted by the fact that they had this mystical ""boba,"" and so ordered a Chai-type version with blueberry-sized and -shaped balls floating on the bottom, and an oversized straw to facilitate sucking them up along with the drink. I tried one boba ball and it was gelatinous and chewy - not at all like what I expected - and an odd sensation, but I would totally order one the next time Im in.  Being in the District and flanked by stores like ""Hottie Inc."" and Guess, there were several teens inside hanging out in large numbers - boo. So, we decided to sit outside for as long as we could stand it. I was surprised to find that the several shaded tables and misters made for a pretty comfortable environment, and we hung out for a good hour or so before I got so sweaty I have to get mobile.   So, in summary, I would totally come back. Probably before or after a movie, to grab a drink and support an independent store among a mecca of chain retail. Plus, right across the way there is an ASU art gallery (closed Sunday and Monday) that we peeked into and actually cool, interesting sculpture art by local artist and asu instructor David Young.   Touche, the District at Tempe Marketplace - I have to say I am impressed!"
2,"I hate giving this place two stars, but the service has always been inconsistent. Ive been coming here since 2006, and the food has always been excellent. Service has been spotty though; during my most recent visit our server blew off two of our drink orders and I had to order from the bar myself. Honestly if they would hire some frumpy old veteran servers then I bet everything would improve ten fold. Anyone else ever had this problem?"
5,One of the best restaurant in town. I have been there few times and they really manage to wow me every time ! The owner if nice and friendly and is really on top of things. The service is great and the food is amazing ! We are going again this Saturday and I cant wait to taste their New Years eve menu. Happy New year :)
1,"My son and his family arrived into Scottsdale Tuesday April 10 on there way to California. We decided to eat at RnR before they continued there trip.  My son and my wife ordered a hamburger and fries. The fries had no taste and my son asked for two new orders. My grandchildren ate the original fries, while the new fries loaded with Parmesan cheese. The fries were not hot, nor had the cheese melted. I had a few of the fries and did not have as severe a case of food poisoning as my son and my wife.  I have recommended RnR in the past. I do not think I will in the future."
4,"I have been searching for a good Pho restaurant ever since Saigon Pho in Chandler went down hill.  Pho Van is a very clean, well organized, and well staffed restaurant in the Asian Center that shares space with Lee Lees and other shops.   I had the traditional Pho Ga (chicken soup in beef broth) and Goi Cuon (Spring rolls).  Both were very good.  The noodles in the broth were perfectly cooked and had great texture and the chicken was all white meat and very tender.  The veggies that accompany the pho were fresh and crisp.  The Spring Rolls were perfect as well stuff full of healthy green veggies.   The prices were a little higher than I am used to in a pho place but it was not bad.  They also do not accept AMEX so beware if that is all you use.   Overall a great place and this is my new Go-To-Pho in the valley."
4,Nice atmosphere. Good food. I had the buffalo on some fluffy fantastic foccacia bread. It was awesome. A combo with a drink and chips came to $9. They have free wi-fi which makes working or using your iPhone a pleasure.
5,"Been dying to come here ever since I saw this place on Unique Eats. Very laid back gastropub with a friendly, funny/entertaining staff!  We grabbed drinks at the bar first - Moescow Mule (ginger beer, cucumber, lime, rocks) & the Persian (Absolut Wild Tea vodka, St. Germain elderflower liqueur, sweet & sour, Persian cucumber juice, lemon peel, rocks) which were both good, not too strong, but a good refreshing drink. Appetizers: 1) Pork Belly Pastrami (rye spaetzle, Brussels sprout sauerkraut) 2) The Original Chopped Salad Please order both. They were both delicious! I was in love with the salad especially. Entrees: 1) Lamb Burger (Serbian lepinja roll, pickled cucumber-onion, tzatziki, Kennebec French fries & house made ketchup) I tend to be very picky about my lamb... Actually Im not reallly a fan of it/the particular taste and smell lamb has. Why I ordered this, I dont know, but I can tell you that I liked it. The taste/odor of lamb wasnt overwhelming and it was juicy. 2) Pan Seared Scallops (Hampshire bacon, roasted corn grits, wilted snow pea greens & Red Rock cola gastrique) 3) Amaro Meatloaf (Montenegro Amaro Italian liqueur, pork, beef, parsnip meatloaf, smashed Yukon gold potatoes, roasted zucchini, veal demi-glace): the server described it as very meaty and meaty it was! Usually meatloaf is fluffed up with a lot of bread crumbs, but this one was mainly just meat. The mashed potatoes were very good as well."
1,"DONT GET TIFFANY UNLESS YOU WANT A SPEEDY EXPERIENCE Pretty Nail tale with Tiffany- My 10 year old first mani/pedi 4:35 water and feet in chair only 13 minutes and painting toes. Prepped and painted fingernails from the chair- in 20 minutes. 35 minutes in all. Told owner I was unhappy and she said that a kid mani/pedii was 35 minutes then later 35 to 45 minutes. Tiffany never let it dry between coats so when she sat her under the light she told her only 5 more minutes and I stopped her. She said only the under coats will be wet and the top will be dry. I told her Really because you never even let it dry between coats.  She said not 4 coat. Base 2 color and top is 4 ... well top and base dry fast she said...Owner said"" fast or slow it doesnt matter as long as the polish looks good and it looks good."" I didnt tip her on purpose...not because Im poor- I got poor service. I would expect this for a color change but not a spa pedicure/manicure.  Very disappointed.  Youd think the owners would realize that all the other patrons saw her take advantage of us.  Get anyone but Tiffany unless you want a quick job!"
5,I love their beef sandwiches and thin crust pizza. It is just like being back in Chicago. Love it!
3,"Who would have ever thought, chicken and waffles combination?  It is crazy, but it sure does.  The location of hidden inside a big plaza of Albertsons, Aces Hardware, Gas Station, and much more.  It is really hard to find unless you have been inside the shopping center.  People here in AZ like to say something is located on the northwest corner of the street.  This would make it impossible to describe. Once you get there, the restaurant is pretty small.  Typically there is a pretty long wait, but I was lucky the day I went. One good thing is they offer white breast chicken meat, which is always a bonus.  The chicken was tasty, even though I am normally not a fan of fried chicken.   I love waffles, but it seemed like the waffles came out cold, as though they were reheated or Eggo Waffles.  I loved Eggo Waffles growing up, but I dont expect frozen waffles at an establishment.  I would stick to the chicken and call this place Lo Lo Chicken House."
5,Just tried this place this afternoon. Very friendly staff & great rates with no commitments. You dont need to worry about paying some $25-$40 co pay like at a regular Chiropractics office each time you visit. Its $49 a month and you get four visits a month. Its not like massage envy where you have to sign a contract for a year and its hard to quit. This goes month to month. Try it out once for $19 if you want. This company is really growing. So stop by and see for yourself!!
3,"Traveling sure makes me hungry! After a long flight from Chicago I was just about to break into my 3rd bag of pop chips when it was time for lunch. Hooray! I joined the infamous Lindsey F and Gabi M for lunch here at Daily Dose. When we walked in Gabi told me it was a 3 star restaurant. I wasnt sure why we were eating at a 3 star restaurant when surrounded by so many fabulous dining establishments, but any food would do. We were able to grab a table immediately, the menu is pretty extensive and our waitress was friendly. But yep..3 stars. My rock shrimp tacos sure beat another bag of pop chips, but werent anything special.  And the friendly waitress forgot about our hummus appetizer. If I was in the area I wouldnt hesitate to grab a quick bite or drink here, but nothing here to hop on a plane back to Phoenix."
4,"Being a native Californian-I never knew these existed till I drove from Los Angeles to Charlotte, NC in 2005 and realized they are everywhere!!! I kept seeing these bill boards every few miles and finally decided that I had to try one. Fearing it was something like a ""Waffle House"" which Id had the misfortune to visit once at 3am, I was prepared to turn and walk out if it was disgusting. My first experience was a pleasant surprise and this location is pretty much the same, in fact, every location is the same, which is a good thing when  you are on a road  trip and looking for a clean bathroom and somewhere to grab a bite, maybe get some entertainment for the road. The front entrance is lined with rocking chairs and this location has water misters out there, which is good because the only place I have been that is hotter than Buckeye is Needles, Ca and i think Needles, Ca is right underneath a hole in the Ozone! Anyway, inside they have a little country store with every kind of candy you can imagine and seasonal cute stuff along with books, toys, gifts and such. The bathrooms are usually way cleaner than youd find at a truck stop, rest stop or gas station and they have a full service restaurant with a ""down home"" menu.  Best thing is breakfast all day long and they make great breakfast!  If you are on the road and looking for a clean, pleasant pit stop. This is a great place to spend some time and re-charge for the road."
4,"I came, I saw, I conquered.  Would get five stars but parking here is difficult. No signs on where to park if u cant get in the iddy bitty teeny weeny parking lot. Walked an extra mile just to get to the entrance on the echo side"
4,"I have tried the other one on shea, but this is close to home and work. I love the enviornment, the clientle, the healthy food, outstanding service and very reasonable prices. The waitstaff is great, the food always comes out quick and tastes amazing. Get anything with chicken as it is delicious and if you like hummus try it here. Also, they have great ice tea. This place is one of my favorites and well worth a try."
4,"Love this place! Super fun you never know what you will find until you find it! So heres the deal I just adore to browse in there and get ideas-seriously how can you go wrong? I found a ridiculous item which Im not sure that I want to share online-oh well lets do it. So you know when you buy hot dogs and the package doesnt seal back up? So of course the container store would have something as silly as a hot dog container to hold the rest of your package.  Plus they had great large jars, and shoe boxes, and lots and lots of containers. I think if I could get away with it I would build a room of containers! I love to have things organized and the container store if fun to look at. Check it out!"
3,"I am going to give Aunty Chiladas 3 stars only because I have gone there since I was like 10.  This place has been a staple in the valley before the 51 went by etc etc.  It definitely looks like it has been there for a while and needs a good  asthetic cleaning.  Our table and chairs were sticky and it was pretty dirty outside on the patio.  There were chairs and miscellaneous items on the outside of the restaurant and it needs some TLC. Chips (flour) are good but salsa has black olives (yuk, personal preference) and the hot stuff tasted like it had vinegar in it.  It has a great patio for daytime drinking.  Overall the food is above average. I ordered the fish tacos and they were good.  My accomplice ordered a combo with your typical rice, beans, enchilada, taco etc.  The food was hot and good.  It didnt have a wow factor but the price was good and worth the money. Holy smokes.......The service was awful.  I am not going to mention any names but it was slow in terms of business and even slower in terms of service.  I hope that they do not correlate but they usually do.  Cmon Aunty you are better than this!!!!!!   If you live in the neighborhood then it is worth going here.  I probably will not make the drive again.  Good luck Aunt Chiladas."
3,"If they werent located around the corner, I would never use this store.  I have taken back produce MULTIPLE times due to expiration so watch the dates when buying!!"
5,Had a great experience. DId not feel gouged or pressured and our dog got the proper treatment for dehydration.  Friendly staff. Prompt service. Special attention from Dr. Heinritz appreciated. Very professional.
5,"My wife and I found Four Peaks by chance. We got lucky. The food was great, service was great, and all thr beers rocked. My wifes fav was the Heff and the Arizona Peach. We got a beer glass to remember the occasion and plan to swing by on the way out and grab a growler."
2,"the pedicure was nice, I will give them that... but lady must have wanted 2 close shop early that day as I told her I wanted a pedi & an acrylic manicure when I first walked in. (She asked another customer to come back the next day while I was getting pedi). Needless to say, I didnt get my acrylic set, and towards the end, I could tell she was 1/2 arsing it... and they were a lil pricey... I mean, really, $5 for taking off my nail polish? I would give this place 1 star, but they did do a good job on the pedicure. not returning here..."
5,"When I was a dancer I always came here for everything. Shoes, leotards, skirts, and accessories. They have every type of dance shoe and a wide variety of everything dancers need and want.  Im not sure how many dance shops are in the area, but all of my instructors always recommended this place which is not very close to our studio. The staff is all very kind and knowledgeable which trust me is a very good thing. Dance shoes can get confusing! There are at least three different kind of tap shoes!  Dees also has costume rentals so if you ever need a crazy costume at the last minute Dees can help you out with that too!"
4,"I met fellow Yelpers Brian S and Shannon M here and learned that its all about the sandwich.  And feeling like you have walked on to a set for ""That 60s show"" or ""That 70s Show"".  Its pretty clear the owners of Casellas are focused on the sandwiches, not updating the decor. I had an Italian beef sandwich.  It was great.  And I sat and soaked up the 70s decor as the bread from my sandwich was soaking up the juice. This place is old school all the way - old school awesome.  F#%*ing A.  Now wheres my Trans Am?"
5,"awesome iconic eatery! whenever i visit az i make it a point to stop off at this ultra friendly, fantastic tasting joint.  yeah, it takes a while to figure out the ordering process, but the staff is super helpful, and after the first or second time, one can figure out the system. its just that everything is abbreviated which requires some thought.  i usually mix 2 entrees to get different flavors. love the jerk chicken and fiery pollo diablo. although they are known for their snicker doodles, my dessert is usually ordering another entree to take home for later!  hands down one of my favorite eateries. i wish we had one in minneapolis, mn...i would probably eat there daily for lunch, ha!"
5,We went to The Farm today for lunch to enjoy a picnic on such an awesome beautiful day. I had the Tuscan sandwich and it was awesome. I had expected it to be good but was surprised at just how enjoyable it really was. Im sure sitting outside in beautiful surroundings on a perfect day helped with the experience. This is the prefect place for lunch on a beautiful day. My date was equally impressed so Im sure I will be back!
5,"Went here before a Phx Suns game. DELICIOUS! Everything on the menu looked amazing. I forgot what it was called, but the open-faced steak sandwich was my favorite! All the dishes were even presented nicely! Will definitely eat here again!"
5,"I love this restaurant (even though its a chain and I can hear my brother saying its just a ""glorified Red Lobster"").  I ordered the Crab and Lobster Bisque soup and am drooling thinking about how much I wish I could eat it right now. For my entree I ordered the Atlantic Salmon (stuffed with crab, shrimp, and brie cheese) which was unbelievably amazing. I also had some scalloped potatoes which was basically in the shape of a brick covered with cheesy goodness. I wanted to eat the apple pie for dessert because it looked so delicious, but could barely breathe after eating all that food.  The service was outstanding, although the manager stopping by the table several times throughout dinner was annoying.  I cant wait to come back here."
5,"I got the best KEEN hiking boots on sale here and they have a great selection of dog frisbee and dog boots and dog toys. I like this location, nobody bothers me and I can mill around without anyone bothering me."
5,"This is a great QT for when youre driving through Phoenix on I-17. Its right off the freeway so its perfect for stopping for gas and grabbing a tasty snack. Plus its a QuikTrip, there isnt really any part of it that isnt awesome."
5,"My boyfrind and I attended here this past weekend on Serptember 8,2012 to celebrate our one year anniversary. Every employee went out o their way to tell us Happy Anniversary. We were seated quickly after entering the restaraunt. Our waiter was knowledgeable, friendly and very professional. We were given our own privacy to celebrate intimately. The food was amazing and we both enjoyed our selves so much!! Thank you Meling Pot. We are going to make you our annual celebration spot!!!"
5,"By now youve heard the adventures at the Rustlers Roost ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/rustlers-rooste-phoenix#hrid:_gYib8eA4hDfylSs17Zc_g ). But my adventures in Phoenix didnt end there.  My BGF had been hounding me for days to find some great ""Q."" He was convinced that AZ would have great ""Q"" on every corner. Now referring back to the link above, I admit that I had a wee hangover at the time. Anyway, Ill press on. We chose this place because BGF thought that this would be the spot.  I ordered the roast garlic chicken and realized with my first bite that I had died (most likely alcohol poisoning from the night before) and was now in heaven. This was the best freakin chicken that I ever tasted. Of course Im in heaven and BGF is grousing about the ""Q"" not being any good.  Now Ive listened to this all week from him.  - This Q is too Spicy  - This Q is too wet  - This Q wont fall off the bone  - This Q doesnt have the right flavor.  Ill admit it, I snapped. (And I didnt forgive him for about 2 weeks). I went up one side and down the other. If you dont like the gosh darn (loosely translated) Q in AZ, the quit ordering the Blankity Blank (translation again) stuff. Needless to say, I got quite the look from BGF and boss. Boss was actually laughing at us.  Anyway, I took pity on my BGF and shared some of my chicken, and he fell in love (I dont know why, it wasnt a rooster - oops, I digress). Anyway, it was decided then and there, this is the best chicken around, hands down."
2,"Last summer when I was in AZ I ate here a few times and it was always great!  I love the pulled pork sandwich.  I ate here while I had family in town a few weeks ago and it was nothing like it used to be.  The sandwich was lacking in flavor, they didnt have the same sides they used to.  We got these fried potatoes which had way to much seasoning on them, none of us ate them.  This place has gone way down hill, I wont be going here anymore."
1,Ive eaten here twice and I dont think Ill ever eat here again. I ordered the lettuce wraps and the food smelled like horrible BO. It made me so nauseous I couldnt even eat it. The salad is decent but I still cant get over that smell!
5,"If you are looking for a great location for bulk specialty flours and grains, beans, Freeze Dried fruits, vegetables, meats and dairy...they have a wonderful selection. They also have water storage and emergency supplies like solar ovens. Im a big fan!"
4,"this place is growing on me. i wasnt a big fan at the beginning thinking they cater to the yuppy crowd that wants to be seen. i still think thats the case, but i think people truly go for the atmosphere and good food. the vig cobb is really tasty and you just cant go wrong with sweet potato fries...my weakness! the interior is really cool and creative and the vibe is casual and friendly. lunch hour tends to get a little busy, but they have a decent amount of seating for such a small place."
5,"Ahhh, Four Peaks.  By far my favorite restaurant in Phoenix.  This place is fantastic as far as brew pubs go - great beer and great food to go with it.  I cant believe I havent taken the time to review it yet... The Beer: pretty consistently awesome.  All the beers are at least ""good,"" my favorites being 8th Street Ale and their IPAs (Hop Knot and Raj).  I have to say the Kiltlifter is a tad overrated, but still pretty solid, and worth a try.  Ive been meaning to try one of their cask conditioned ales, but they always seem to be out, probably indicative of the quality of those selections. The Food: fantastic!  I cant say that Ive ever had a bad meal at Four Peaks.  The Italian Beef Beer Bread is the best thing on the menu, but you cant go wrong with the Chicken Fingers, Chicken Salad Pita, or really any of their sandwiches.  The fries are also great here - theres a little crispy coating on the outside that is quite tasty.  Oh, and the Spicy Thai Hummus is also a really good appetizer.  A little more liquidy than your average hummus, but really good.  It has a nice little kick to it that will have you reaching for your beer. Bottom line, if you live in Phoenix, like beer, and enjoy eating a good meal, then you should be shot if you dont like Four Peaks.  If you havent been yet, do yourself a favor and try it.  Youll come away happy, I promise."
2,"We had lunch here with the In-laws today. Highlights: the wait staff is awesome. Fast, friendly, fun; everyone here is ON it. Lowlights: the food. Its not terrible, but kind of meets expectations of a diner in a strip mall. Weak coffee, white bread, smaller portions, nothing was particularly great. Nothing really sucked; but was just mediocre. They must be doing something right, it was crowded and my in-laws like it. Id rather go without eating than visit here again."
5,"I have been going to Vatoci hair salon for over a year now. Ive had the same stylist from day one and I highly recommend her. Ive never had so many compliments on my hair! Ask for Marsha (Mirushe) and I guarantee shell take amazing care of you.  I love that she always remembers what we talk about and asks me about my job and my kids too. I am sure that Spiro and Vera also do a great job because the people who are in there when I am are regulars and everyone is always happy to be there.  My daughter loved going in to be pampered as well, and they are amazingly flexible on scheduling appointments even though they always seem to have plenty of customers. They know what they are doing. Highly recommend!"
3,"It is with great regret that I give House of Tricks three stars. Ive been here twice.  The first time, friends invited me and the wifey here for dinner.  Seeing the patio, I thought, ""oh, this is really cute.""  Once seated inside, I thought, ""oh, this is really cute.""  Seeing the prices on the dinner menu, I thought, ""oh, this better be really good.""  Long story short, it was okay.  My friend, who had only been here for lunch, apologized for the unexpectedly high prices.  I didnt care too much, I guess.  It was edible.  Id probably come back for lunch. Which I did, with co-workers in tow.  The prices at noon were certainly more agreeable and we all looked forward to a pleasant meal.  Suddenly, this gem of an exchange occurred between our waiter and my boss, Debbi: Debbi:  How large is the quiche?  I weigh 230 pounds, so Im a big girl. We giggled.  Debbi loves to joke. Waiter:  Well, its not as big as you. Bad form, dude.  Bad form.  Youre lucky we paid lunch menu prices."
5,"As far as I know, Im the only person in this town that has a dish named after them. I could be wrong, but Im pretty sure Im right. I mean, Im always right. By now, if you read my reviews, you know that I am vegan and I dont eat gluten. This makes dining out quite an issue at times, especially for breakfast/brunch.  I really wanted to hit up The Vig Uptown for brunch because I like it as a Happy Hour spot, the space is incredible, it is within a bike ride from my house, and I love the Original Vig, but alas, there was nothing on the menu to accommodate me. I gently mentioned in person and a few times on FaceBook that having some sort of tofu scrambler would really improve their menu. They listened. They created. They named. (after me!!!) We stopped by for brunch this past Sunday for the dishes debut, and got a personal hello from Tucker. He was excited because they had already sold TEN AMber Scramblers that morning and it isnt even officially on the menu yet! Im already a star! So, whats the verdict on the AMber Scrambler? Amazing. Seriously. The thing that really sets this apart from other scrambler dishes is sun dried tomatoes. They bring such a delicious flavor! It certainly doesnt hurt that it comes with their signature guac and a side of pico. Ill be here every weekend for the delicious dish and the $5 fresh squeezed mimosas! If you know whats good for you, you will too."
4,"Strolled in with a posse of 14 people for a birthday party. The staff was accommodating in getting everyone seated and served with drinks, especially as people funneled on in throughout the night.  The place isnt huge, it can really only accommodate one large party at a time. First off, if you are a vegetarian or Muslim, be aware that you are going to an authentic italian restaurant - meaning that 75% of their menu items will have sausage/ham/salami/etc. Being cognizant of that, it was a smart idea to peak at the menu before arriving. We got the Vegetariana Pizza ($14), which came with Mozzarella, Provolone, Caramelized Onions, Roasted Peppers, and Parmigiano Reggiano. I thought it tasted great, it was crispy, thin-crust and had plenty of cheesy to it. I thought it was an above average pizza, but nothing that would have impressed Emeril. In addition to the pizza, we split the Spiedini al Forno ($16), which was Marinated Beef Tenderloin in a Shish Kabob style with Onions, Bell Peppers & Tomato. The waitress advised us in ordering the beef ""medium"" and no higher because it may get too dry or overcooked. I dont usually do medium, but she advised us correctly. It came out with only a little bit of redness and packed a good flavor. The onions, bell peppers and tomato are Kim Kardashian, meaning that they are all show and no substance. I didnt think they added anything to the entree and in fact, I didnt even eat them - which is rare for me to pass up on food. It wasnt like I was full, they just tasted bland. For dessert, they brought the birthday boy a Dolce Della Casa ($12), which is a slightly charred sweet calzone filled with chocolate hazelnut sauce and topped with bananas and vanilla ice cream. Everyone shared and It hit the spot. However, once the ice cream runs out, youre outta luck. The dessert is really complemented with the sweetness and coldness of the vanilla ice cream.  The environment was kinda noisy (probably because we were a group of 14), and the wait staff was kinda slow (once again, because there were 14 of us), but they had a TV playing the knicks game so I was happy being able to watch LINSANITY, and the woodfire oven was blazing away for some good ambience. Overall, this place would be much better for a date or small group gatherings, otherwise you may be waiting for your food too long or feel a little crowded. Oh and just beware, the bill can become a little pricey if you arent splitting entrees...."
4,"If you are in the mood for pizza this is possibly the best pizza, no it is the best pizza that I have had thus far from tempe.  This is a five star if Tempe was the only place in arizona. They have amazing pizza that does not taste like a piece of hot cardboard with tomato past and a sad excuse for cheese.  Unlike other pizza places the owners are some real italians and keeps the company in the family. Recommendation: To anyone living in tempe and enjoys a REAL pizza."
4,"I had the pleasure of going to the grand opening of Total wine and more!  They had penny wine tasting, they card you at the door and you put your penny into the hurricane jug.  The place is Disneyland for adults, they have every imaginable wine, liquor, or beer that you would be searching for.  Since I recently went to Sonoma, California in August, I was looking for a few of my fave wines that I liked, but they did not have some of the smaller wineries and plus they are limited releases.  I did find one from Ferrari-Carano, Fumé Blanc,  for $10.97. Ferrari told me that you can find some of their wines in a grocery stores, but not the Fume Blanc, so they lied.  I also purchased a Kokopelli Cab for $13.99 and Kokopelli is local to Arizona  made in Wilcox.   This place has excellent deals and glad to see this kind of store in San Tan Village Mall."
2,"I may make a few enemies in writing this review, and I may even get kicked out of Tempe completely, but seriously, Four Peaks is not the love of my life. Granted, I dont care for beer, so this is more or less a review of the food, atmosphere, and non-beer-like drinks. I have been here a few times with the husband (he loves it here) and I just dont get the hype. The food is bar food. Straight up bar food. I like the outdoor seating much better than indoor. Inside the place feels a little dreary, much like many bars I have encountered. The servers are friendly enough, although sometimes the service is a little slow. I get something different to eat every time, which if you know me, is not a good thing. When I like something, I get it every visit, but here, I am just searching for something - anything - that I like enough to order next time. Sigh. I know Ill be back, and I cant say I dread coming here - I usually have fun. I just feel like there are many places Id rather spend my money on."
3,"Unique place that you wouldnt stop at unless you were recommended.  Seriously, this isnt the type of place you drive by and say oh, lets stop there -- word of mouth is what Im guessing drives this business. We were recommended to visit this place by the entertainer for the evening, a belly dancer.  Efes isnt your typical sit-down restaurant -- in fact, you may have to kneel down.  The environment is to set a casual Turkish dinner setting.  If you have a big party, some of you may be sitting on the floor...dont worry, there are plenty of pillows. The entertainment was good (if you like belly dancing) and the music was interesting.  Our party of 4 opted for the super sampler to start and the Efes mix to share. I personally like this type of food.  Exotic, full of spices, not your typical meats.  My wife didnt necessarily find it great, but ate some and didnt complain :-).  I think the Doner Kabob was the best.  If you go with a group, the Efes mix was a great way to try a little of everything and was plenty of food for our party of 4."
5,"First timers to this park on an early Sunday morning. Me, my bf, and our 2 old English bulldogs had a great experience.  You can choose between the active or passive dog park. We choose active but also decided to keep our dogs on leash being our first time and all.  We were immediately greeted by a woman and her 2 boxers, very friendly. We walked the perimeter of the park to get our dogs use to being around other dogs and talked to several people along the way.  We did have a small incident when a dog snapped at our dog but no harm, no foul.  Looking forward to bringing the dogs here again!"
3,"Sometimes theres a cover, and sometimes there isnt. In true nightclub fashion, you can never really tell what its going to be either.  Ive never seen anything good happen downstairs. The music has never been good, regardless of the genre that night (Hip Hop, Techno, etc). And, the overall vibe is pretty lackluster. Upstairs, however, is house music heaven. Located outside under the stars, on a relatively small balcony, the vibe is always pretty stellar. Open air, video collages on the walls, and AWESOME music. Ive never been let down yet. Even on a random Wednesday evening recently, when it was almost empty, the music was still amazing. If you live in the Valley, you have to visit the upstairs of Bar Smith at least once. Its fantastic. Its a shame theyve never been able to replicate any of the upstairs magic to the rest of the club though."
2,"Terrible coffee.  So bitter I would have to dump a quarter cup of cream and several heaping tablespoons of sugar into this cup-a-joe to overpower the flavor...  but at that point, why wouldnt I go all out and find myself a milkshake or some other creamy sugary treat?   The muffins are the size of your head.  Lots of calorie-laden treats.  I had some carrot cake once and it had that stale refrigerator flavor in the icing.  What a waste.  My advice, walk across the street to Starbucks. At least youll get a mediocre cup of coffee instead of a bad one."
4,"It was so hot on the day I went to this place, they were baking the pizzas on the roof! hehe!  I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the pizza, pretty damm good. I have 2 slices and one of Sicilian; all were just like NYC. The service was good too, unlike in NYC. :)"
3,"We ordered from here the first day in our new home, also the first NFL Sunday this season. I was expecting about an hour wait. They quoted me 45 minutes for delivery, and when the doorbell rang after 20 I thought it was solicitors or perhaps neighbors coming to welcome us into the neighborhood. I was pleasantly surprised that it was our food.  We ordered a mushroom pizza (meh), and wings and chicken tenders - both very tasty. Were used to more thin crust pizzas, NY style I guess? so this was a bit doughy, but the garlic herb crust was yummy nonetheless. Not sure if well order from here again, unless we dont find our NY style place, but it was still good."
5,"Theres the sweetest (and cutest) guy who works there and one time, my total came to 5.45, i had a 5 in my hand as I was scraping for change in my dance bag but he was like ""its on me."" and took it from his tips! I know its just 45 cents and i could probably find that under the seats in my car but he truly made my day with something so little like that! I LOVE this place!! :D"
3,"Ate here the other day with a friend for lunch, it was my first time there. I had the Tom Kha Gai soup, my friend had the Thai fried rice with tofu, each was ""Thai hot.""  We shared. Scrumptious! The fried rice dish was large. We also shared some mini eggrolls. Mini. I think my soup couldve been more dense with lemon grass and cilantro, but it was yummy anyway. I guess its cuz Im a sucker for this dish. I think its much better at Mailees in Scottsdale but you pay 5 bucks more. The place is spartan, not fancy, has some damage, looks like what you would expect by looking at the outside. Im not picky as long as the place isnt a complete dump. Thai restaurants for me dont have to be princess palaces.... Ive enjoyed Chars for years, and it showed its age but wasnt in a state of disrepair. They have some beers on hand as well. The menu has a variety of curries, which I look forward to trying. Id like to try this place again, I just dont have much more to say at the moment other than I spied a few dishes on their way to their enjoyers, and they looked appealing. Convenient location.  Worth a try, not bad. You know if it was Id tell you. Give it a try for weekday lunch, they have a lunch special menu."
1,"May have great food but Ill never know. Ordered delivery and the chef who doesnt speak English couldnt find my apartment complex even when I walked out to the street right next to the 101 far away. He said he was there but couldnt tell me where he was. Talked to him on the phone for ten minutes then hung up on me when I guess he got frustrated and wouldnt answer my calls back. Called to order food for my visiting family and was glad to find this place but that chef is awful. The owner apologized to me profusely and that was a nice gesture but waiting an hour for a guy who hangs up on you and cant find a place looking at the 101 exit is ridiculous. Dont use them for delivery ever, call the Breakfast Joynt. Their owner is awesome and delivers to you himself. Plus, he actually knows the area. Cannot express my frustration with this restaurants service. Do not use EVER"
4,"PBR. Mad Dog 20/20. What??!! I was a witness to someone drinking Milwaukees Best Light. Damn son. I guess if youre going to do it, do it cheap. Get there early if youre going on Saturday morning for the game, it fills up quick. All in all, it is was it is. An Ohio bar, watching football, peeps getting sliggity sloppt. Most are still drunk from the night before. Makes for good people watching practice. Make friends with your neighbors when you find a seat. They could be from Ohio and a new person to be ""besties"" with. Nice!! Thanks Mickeys, you rock... and roll."
5,"This is my new addiction! Took some friends and family here to celebrate my moms birthday, it was her first time and she had a blast.  Our first chef Poncho isnt at this location any more which we were disappointed about but ended up having another great chef named Sam. He was funny and the food was great! I tried grilled shrimp for the first time and I am a fan.  Our waitress was awesome! On top of everything, funny and she told us Sam was the head chef and that it was an honor to have him cook our food and that she was so glad we got him, seeing that it was the first time for almost everyone in our group to try a place like this. We have also had dinner on the patio when it was cooler out and enjoyed it too. I will be eating here often. Thanks Hayashi for always making my dining experience fun and delicious"
3,"Its a Japanese fast food. Im very impressed with the service, the owner spent some times to greet everyone. I ordered beef bowl teriyaki but the beef teriyaki is a lil bit over cooked and the smell of the burning beef just overwhelmed me. The Panko breaded fish plate is the one that I recommend to try. They also have the seaweed salad which I found good. And they also charged for the soda refill $.30"
5,"This place hits everything on my ""its Awesome"" list.  First off its a family run little place. Second its in a hole in the wall area. Thirdly and most importantly it is all made in house.  Fourtherly it is awesome We were in Gilbert staying at a friends house for spring training, GO DODGERS!!! We hit the usuals, Waffle House, Dunkin Donuts, Dodger Dogs at the game, and our friends asked do you like sandwiches? If there is one food group that I love, it has to be the Sandwich group, and  this place is one of my top 5 sandwiches stops of all time. We ate in the Lounge(y)(ie) area, which has a more adult vibe going on. We first started with their fresh bread, and tomato basalmic vinegar salsa(y) thing. Which was great, we had two rounds of that while we drank our beverages, and waited on our sandwiches. I ordered the Cuban sandwich with the potato salad, and the wife ordered the Chicken breast sandwich, with pasta salad. My sandwich came out perfectly, from the fresh Ciabatta Bread to the outstanding roasted pork.  I would order this pork just by itself; it was juicy, and full of flavor, just like my Cuban grandmother makes. While this sandwich is a true Cuban sandwich, not using swiss, and not being pressed, it is not advertised as an actual Cuban, just a Cuban style, like me. Now this potato salad was some of the best I have ever had, and not just because it had bacon, which is awesome, but the use of yukon gold potatoes, instead of red, or russets has been a revelation to me. This is how I am going to prepare all off my potato salads from now on. After all that I still ordered the carrot cake, which like everything else is made in house with local ingredients, it was warm with a not overly sweet cream cheese frosting. The wife got the lava cake with some beer ice cream. Even though I ate most of my carrot cake, and loved it, I wish I had a full gallon of that beer ice cream, it was just perfect. In fact I am planning another trip out that way, just for that ice cream."
4,"Great lunch buffet, for the price, you get a ton of different types of food to try.  The naan is great and piping hot.  I will say that their chicken tikki masala is not my favorite but overall for the ambiance, this place is super pretty and delicious!"
2,"Thai??? Really?? I love Thai food and couldnt be happier to try a new restaurant. Wow! It was a slap in the face on so many levels. The 2 hostesses were the rudest I have had the displeasure of having to interact with. We ordered take out and as we waited for out food from the kitchen the hostesses made us uncomfortable... As if we were imposing on there entry. The food was not spectacular. We ordered pad Thai , was very dry but not horrible. The sweet or sour beef was watery and seemed more like fajita with way too many peppers. No  sticky rice, green papaya salad, Larb..."
5,"This is definitely not your typical run of the mill nightclub.  First off, let me mention that the decor is gothic cathedral style complete with erotic art, bright lights, and a chandelier over the bar. There is a unisex bathroom that is very clean and surprisingly never awkward. The music on Saturday nights for Doom Disco is an amaazing mix of old and new (think Joy Division and She Wants Revenge). Plus, the bartenders can make a mean gin and tonic and they have a pretty well stocked bar for any other drinks you might fancy.  Tip: Doom Disco also has a Facebook page where they post pictures and the playlist from the Saturday before. Check it out! Overall, its 100% worth the drive and $5 cover"
4,"Mmmmmm...why did I wait so long to try this????  Unbelievable pizza!!!!!!!!!!  I would give 5 stars, bjt the service was...well, not great.  Its ok, we all have off days.  Well be back!!!!"
4,"Coming from a place where there is mexican food on every couple streets, I have truly missed an authentic mexican restaurant or joint. This place is legit! Good tacos, good burritos, real good non-taco bell mexican!  If you want some real Mexican food, try this place out!"
4,"I went to Khai Hoan yesterday and ordered the rare beef pho.  Now, this is the first time I have had pho before and I would say it is much like a glorified bowl of Ramen Noodles.  That said, it was good.  To me, not great, just good.  We got the combination appetizer plate.  The spring roll was amazing.  The crab was great.  I didnt like the ""egg roll"" as much as I thought I would, but it was definitely fresh.  I had fresh coconut juice to drink and it was delightful.  I would go back again for sure, but I would be ordering something other than the pho."
4,"I went to lunch with my buddy, Rob M., to a place called Uncle Bears Bar and Grill. It was actually pretty cool! I was surprised because it is in one of the more LAME areas near my house. Namely ""Warner and Cooper"". When we entered however, it was anything BUT lame. Dog bowls on all the tables filled with mutant peanuts. Granted, it was lunch, but there really wasnt more than 3 other groups there. This led me to believe the food/service was bad. Not at all! This place rocked! We shared some nachos in a heterosexual kinda way, and shared manly stories about football before shoving off. By the way, Rob, you owe me $15.00!!!"
2,"Not impressed. Beer was cold, but bar keep was disinterested in assisting us, atmosphere was drab, place was small, and the to go order was TERRIBLE! There was no BBQ the day we were there and I just wasnt feeling the place.  My hubby and I have been missing this place since it closed its original restaurant in Cave Creek. We heard it moved to Phoenix and we found it and went there this past week. Unfortunately, it was nothing like the old, hopping, smell good, smokey, fun filled environment of the original SF.  I can see that they have a lot of regulars and the barkeep knew everyone that walked through the door, which to me,  was very cool, but it just wasnt gelling for me this night I suppose.  We ordered the deep Fried green chilis and there was soooo much batter  on them, I had to really concentrate hard to find the chili. I ended up peeling all of the batter off of the chilis just to get a small bite. icky.  I would give this another chance just because I hate writing a bad review. So, after the holidays, may check it out on a Friday night and see where it stands then, Also, I will hope that when I arrive next time, the smoker out back is kicking and there is some REAL BBQ to be had."
2,"Nothing like Capriottis in other cities.  They dont have the same menu offerings as east coast locations, and even though I ate here when not busy it took a very long time for the food to arrive.  Parking is frustrating too because of the adjacent Starbucks patrons occupying so many spots.  Very poor chips selection as well - only two choices.  Really? 2 chips?"
4,"I really like this place! Ive been wanting something like this to open for years, and now its right around he corner! Im a huge sushi fan, but I rarely have enough time during the week to stop and get any... Until now! This place is exactly what youd hope for in a fast food sushi joint- helpful, friendly staff, good variety, good prices, and a clean dining space. I admit the whole make your own thing can be a little intimidating at first, just order one of their features rolls to get yourself started, then take off the training wheels on your next visit. You pick white or brown rice, meats, up to three veggies, and whatever sauces you want. The possibilities are endless! Ive eaten enough sushi to know generally what works together, so Ive been pretty happy with what Ive come up with so far. The rolls are tasty and filling, and their traditional sides are great if youre super hungry. The only complaints I have are that the fish can be a little bland (even the so called spicy), so you pretty much need to add a sauce of some kind. And some slices of fresh jalapeño! The parking lot is also a nightmare during weekday lunch hour, but I still think its worth it."
4,"The building itself has that Frank Lloyd Wright 70s vibe going on...not my taste, but our City isnt very old so I can live with this minor aesthetic annoyance.  (Remember when they almost tore the Orpheum down? Not cool. Fight to keep history here folks...) Anyway, anytime I hear people begrudgingly ask ""What is there to do in Phoenix?""  I would have to suggest: We do have culture here, if youre willing to venture outside of your comfort zone and outside of the suburbs.  Phoenix is privileged enough to have an Opera Company and Ballet Company who are great at what they do. I saw the Nutcracker most recently and GOODNESS, they all had impressive resumes.  The conductor, and costume designer were definitely stand outs.   As audience members we are supremely lucky because the venue itself is small enough to ensure you will have a fantastic seat no matter where you are. I will go back. I cant wait to go back. My soul craves this, as should yours."
1,"Second to worst dining experience of all time. Our waitress was a little timid, which is fine, but it we shouldnt have to wait 20 minutes just to order our food.  Our food took 45+ minutes to arrive, and while our friends steak came out hot, our Hibachi Steak and Potatoes were room temperature.  Sent it back to be warmed, they offered to pay for it, which is great.  Both managers came and said hi and apologized for the slow cook staff, and made sure everything was great.  That was the last we saw of them for the next half hour.  We finished our meals, and 10 minutes later, had to flag down a different waitress to go and find our waiter, and to bring us cheesecake menus.  We always get the Dulce de Leche, but they brought us terrimisu or some junk.  I gave it back to the waiter (after walking the restaurant to hunt him down) and said ""no thanks, Ill just pass on the cheesecake.""  He looked surprised, and later said we didnt have to pay for that cheesecake.  Well Id sure hope not! Two hours of my life are gone.  I usually like this restaurant, but tonights service disaster will prevent me from EVER going to this location again, free food or not."
1,"My boyfriend and I tried this place last year and we havent been back since. The food was really unspectacular, they werent really that hot. The price is a bit high since theres a restaurant by the same name on Southern and Dobson that serve much better food for less. The decor was really tacky and they should paint over the mural, it does not appeal to their clientele. Lastly, the staff was not nice."
2,Ive been here twice for lunch. Its okay but I wont be coming back. The portions are small. I had one of the curries and it was good. But I had the pad thai which the menu said contains chicken and shrimp. Not a single shrimp on the plate. Cheap bastards. One of the lower quality Thai restaurants Ive been to in Phoenix next to Thai Hut.
5,I love their turkey and provolone cold sub! Delicious with pickles added.
4,"Pretty cool place that appeals to 2 very different crowds.  My friends and I stayed downstairs for the majority of the night. The hip hop music was pretty good and the DJ had a excellent music selection. The bartenders were very friendly, except for one of the blonde girls. When I put my empty beer bottle on the bar, she took it and I raised my hand to say ""thank you"" for taking it. Then she came back with another beer that I didnt order, and I think she got a little pissed because she misunderstood me. At the end of the night, I asked for some water and she only gave me a bottle instead of just a cup of tap water and charged me $2. Dont be a hater lady!! GET A SHOT OF CAFE PATRON!!! If you like coffee and patron, its literally the best of both worlds. And, to top it all off, they are only $3 A SHOT!! Very reasonably priced. I had 3 within a span of an hour (Im a heavyweight so I wouldnt recommend that for everyone!) Upstairs, they have techno/house music and its packed like no other. The people are really cool though. They have friendly battles and its pretty cool to just watch them for about 10 minutes. Depending on your scene, you can pick either floor."
4,its tiny and awesome!
4,"A trendy looking bar...in the airport, hmmm. Wait, in the Phoenix airport?!? No way, impossible, not a chance. These were all the things I assumed before I actually arrived at Barfly before my flight to Mexico a few weeks ago, and I could not have been more wrong. I wish I was there longer and actually had a chance to sample some of their offered dishes, which honest to god sounded pretty decent. Its still the airport so plan on paying the awesome prices of $10 a beer etc but at least you can spend your pre-flight time drinking on a cozy leather couch watching tube rather than the alternative Fox Sports bar in every other terminal."
3,"Ok, they should be happy that I am understanding of the flying bug that landed in my dessert and died before it was served.  Yes, I found it as I was eating the dessert, grossed me out, but not necessarily their fault.  The manager came over and apologized and took the dessert off the bill and offered me another one.  Anyway, the rest of the meal was great.  My party and I had the scallops with green beans and capers.  Yummy!  I do like Pappadeauxs overall and this is the first time I didnt have a great experience."
2,"we had the back door pizza for a village and in a word...yuck.  i think the spinach was frozen and not fresh, the prosciutto had an unusual bitterness or was it the sauce? we also paid 8 bucks for two tins of lettuce with either bland dressing on one or little to no dressing on the other and maybe a few shavings of cheese.  soooo not worth the money."
2,"Had a couple of happy hour apps here, all flavorless. Bacon wrapped scallops: bacon undercooked, scallop overcooked.  Seared Ahi Tuna:  flavorless.  Pork sliders:  Not bad, but not memorable. Service was good. Go to Tutti Santi in the same mall instead."
5,"Chipotle is my go to place when I feel like picking up a quick meal, and this happens to be my local one. Always busy, and youll almost always see someone you know getting some delicious Chipotle as well. Portions are huge, but no complaining because its all delicious!"
5,"I dont love the coffee at Starbucks, but this place is getting 5 stars for their service! They are quick, ACCURATE, friendly, and they always remember my drink even though I only go there about once a week! Amazing! The staff is great and I thought I should leave them a nice little ""Good Job"" on Yelp!"
5,Fantastic Happy Hour 3-6pm! Half price appetizers and good drink prices. I like their Sushi and Garlic Noodles. And pretty much everything Ive had there is good. I had a Peppercorn Steak about 2 weeks ago and it was amazing. Its right next to the movies so its a good place to meetup too.
3,"Went here for fathers day with my girlfriends parents because they gave a free entree for dad. He choose the fish and chips which looked amazing, I had fish tacos, my girlfirend had the steak and her mom got a salad. Everyhting was good. The service was great and the beers were decent. It was everything I could expect from a chain and thensome. I might even go back."
5,"My new favorite place.  I love this pizza.  I became a vegetarian in March.  So cheese pizza with mushrooms and olives is very important to me.  And Mamma Mias is cheap and delicious, my favorite combo.  And my constant companion, my 9 year old daughter born in Philly and a fan of hoagies, loves their turkey subs.  Im just in it for the pizza.   And if you sit outside you can watch the people going to the liquor store next door and watch the people playing frogger to get across the street to the Vig.  Pretty good people watching."
4,"Very excited to have a neighborhood grocery downtown!  Ive been in twice now and was surprised how many people were in there considering they just opened on Thursday.  They have a really nice wine selection without the usual suspects, the cheese case has many nice, reasonably priced offerings and the pastry case looked delicious too! They still have a few bugs to work out, but that is to be expected from a new business.  I definitely recommend enjoying a glass of wine at the bar with some cheese...yummy!"
4,"Love spicy Mexican food? Well then this is the place for you. They have great food, great service and great beers to choose from. My family and I go here often."
5,"I found some great t-shirts for friends here, including one from a local PHX artist with a grinning skull.   If youre a hipster or looking to buy gifts for one, then this is the place to go.  Plus, the clerk was using a Mac (not that I would expect anything different, but bonus verisimilitude points for fitting in with your surroundings Mr. Clerk)."
5,"Great experience at the Phoenician, specifically Il Terrazzo. We normally buy many loaves of bread from them at OTFM (Old Town Farmers Market). They were absent yesterday so we called in an order & went directly there to pick it up. Was gorgeous of course & they were as nice as pie. And the important part is that the bread was fabulous as always (olive walnut, chocolate cherry sourdough, farmers rye, wheat sourdough, rosemary sourdough, baguette)."
5,"Tempe Beach Park - such a gem in our landlocked State... Sure, its a man-made water source, and yes - its pretty nasty if you plan on swimming inside Tempe Town Lake, but its gorgeous during the day and at night too! Ive done a handful of triathlons that started and ended at Tempe Beach Park, and most recently, I did the PetSmart Walk (go team Yelp) that took place at the park as well...  With the proximity of the park to ASU / Mill Ave, it really is a fun place to go hang for an afternoon - no matter whats going on there... My only words of wisdom - dont swallow the lake water!"
5,Cary is one of the most honest and knowledgeable mechanics Ive ever been to. He is caring to all of his customers and his shop takes the utmost care with the cars they work on. I cannot recommend him strongly enough!
5,"I love the urban feel of this place, and the swanky Apple Store is a big enough draw for me! The place is brand new, so not too many things are going on yet, but more stores are opening all the time! Theres now a really high-end iPic movie theater, a frozen yogurt place, a great Nike store, and much more to come in addition to H&M, West Elm, and the delicious Oakville Grocery Co.  Parking is fine and its easy to navigate. When youre done here you can walk to Kierland across the street, too! :) Cant wait to see what they do here in a few years!"
1,"I just thought Id post an update.  I planned never to go back, but was with a friend who really wanted one of their breakfast items.  I skipped ordering ANY food whatsoever and merely ordered coffee and watched her eat.  As fate would have it, she had a BACK HAIR in her scrambled eggs (we are 2 for 2 now).  My gag reflex is going off as I type this.  My husband, friends, and I have renamed this place the Black Hair Diner, and weve decided they have actual black bears cooking in the kitchen, since they cant seem to keep black hairs out of their food."
5,"Even though Ive only been to Bosa once Ive had the donuts from here several times.  My parents have been coming here regularly (like, multiple times a week regularly) since this place opened and every time I come to visit they make sure to get me donut in the morning when they know Im hungover in bed. Now, Im only reviewing this place for the donuts.  I didnt even know this place served other breakfasty stuff until I came here myself, but the other pastries & coffee drinks sound good as well.  That being said, when it comes to donuts Bosa is as good as it gets. Theyre soft, chewy, and all around yummy...that goes for all varieties (well, the ones Ive tasted anyway).  Another good thing...theyre CHEAP!  Its not like donuts break the bank anyway, but even compared to chain donut places the donuts here practically cost nothing.   The place itself is not much to look at, but who cares!  All I want is the donuts!"
4,"Im so not a pub & grub kinda gal, but since this place saved me 2 times during a Science Center visit = pretty ok.  You can walk across from AZ Science and make this kid friendly pit stop in the middle of the day - i really am not familiar with anything else that now its the parents turn sorta thing close by. Fun pool table in 1 of the rooms.  Really good steak fries, fish and chips are good, and so is the french onion soup.  Since i am a wine drinker, this is not the place for wines by the glass, obviously it is a beer place, and me not being a beer drinker, not my cup of tea - ah~hem, pint that is.... sooo, all-n-all a fun thing to do after sacrificing for the kids!"
5,I love this place I have been here 2wice and it puts of the others in the country to shame. I hope that I can volunteer here.
1,"We ordered $40 worth of pizza for takeout and it took almost 2 hours -- was told 20 minutes. We were not compd for anything. When I expressed my dissatisfaction, they offered to give me $40 credit toward my next order. I asked for this in writing, and they gave me the ""we cant provide it in writing -- we wrote your name down and have you on record"" line. Guess what -- I called back a couple months later and they had no record. They refused to honor the credit....and were rude. I asked to speak to the owner, and was told ""hes out of town."" The pizza is mediocre at best. I have zero tolerance for businesses such as this. PLEASE spend your money somewhere else that deserves to be patronized."
4,Very polite staff. Did not wait very long to be seen.
3,"Great atmosphere, friendly staff, and good food.  Dined with a large group so we had a set menu. I requested no butter with my crab stuffed chicken breast but they served it on the side just in case I felt the chicken was too dry.  It was de-lish!"
5,"An amazing section of light bulbs for just about anything you need. Most are in stock, reasonably priced and ready to take home. I have brought in several odd bulbs that I needed to have replaced with no markings on them - They always come through like champs.  Take my advice and covert your old bulbs to LED - Well worth the cost for me just to not have to replace burnt out bulbs all the time - some of my lighting is very hard to get to and Halogens are so damn hot!"
3,"So Im apparently oblivious to the fact that anything with the name Joe is owned by the same person.  Luckily for me, I wasnt stupid enough to order bbq pork again.  Joes Farm Grill is a pretty cool concept and probably the only decent place to eat on this side of the 202 (since Mobsters INC closed, at least).  There are enough review here that clearly he is doing something right.  Suburbanites love to feel like they dont live in a city and, Im sure, love the idea of a restaurant with picnic tables and trees.  They must because the place was a freaking day care when we went, with snotty brats running all around and climbing on everything. Anyways, back to the food.  I ordered a BBQ Bacon Burger.  I didnt bother to specify how I wanted it cooked and it was, surprisingly, cooked to a decent medium-well.  I subbed some sweet potato fries with it and they were pretty good.  Little more pepper would have made them great but oh well.  The wife had wanted to sub the veggie fries with hers but they made us order a side of them.  That side was literally 3 pounds of fried veggies and was way too much for any human to consume.  They werent really my thing but the wife enjoyed. This place does a lot of things well but they suffer from a lot of the logistical problems that Joes BBQ does.  The line is better and it keeps people from getting backed up but they seem to run out of menus quickly.  People grab them, carry them in line, and leave them at the window.  As a result, there are no menus left when people walk in.  I refilled the thing twice while I was standing in line.  Also, the condiment/drink counter is outside and all in a row right by the door into the restaurant.  These weird clusters of people trying to get a drink or some sauce develop and creates an obstacle course for people going in and out of the restaurant.  This leads me to my final problem - the indoor pickup window.  While the summer is long and hot (and Im sure leads to a lot of people usually sitting inside), the day we went had tons of people sitting outside.  When their buzzers went off, they had to go inside to pickup the food.  The single door seemed to be all sorts of hazardous for people going in to get food and people coming out with food.  Finally, and I know this sounds stupid, but the trash can outside has the smallest opening ever.  You cannot actually stick your plastic basket inside the trash can and turn it over to dump your food out.  You have to pick the stuff up out of the basket and throw it away with your hands.  I just finished my meal, cleaned my hands, and now I have to wash them again because I had to handle a greasy, sauce-covered piece of paper to throw it away. I know this sounds nitpicky but it turned what would normally be a 4-star peaceful lunchtime experience into a logistically stressful nightmare for me.  When you make it hard for me to get in and out with my food, it makes me feel like you dont want me there.  I know they are going to read this and I know they are going to dismiss it just like my gripes about Joes BBQ but do me a favor, when you build your next restaurant, hire someone with a degree in urban planning to help with the layout instead of just cramming things wherever you think they will fit."
1,"This address is for the one next to Panda Express, not the one in Walmart. This place sucks and it doesnt even come close to any other McDonalds. How in the world can you have so many employees working and have a line of people waiting for their food? Its like there is retarded people working there and they all have special needs. This one guys was just waiting for a happy meal and had been waiting for 10 minutes before I even got there. It them about 15 minutes for them to give me my food. One mexican kid that was working was to busy flirting with this girl in front of everyone, while her father was asking why the food was taking so long to make.  The dining area was dirty after I got my food and sat down. They should fire the manager and everyone that works there. They take no pride in working there and its sad to see this. It shouldnt matter what they are being paid to be there, its still a job and they ARE being paid to be there.  I will NOT be returning to this place......."
3,"This airport is the most confusing airport Ive ever been to.  Obviously it was meant to be small and was originally probably very efficient, but since they have added terminals it makes no sense and you will see the sign you need as you are passing it, instead of having a sign a mile or so ahead telling you were to go."
2,"I was very impressed by their website and their services, and setting up my files for my cards was super easy and straightforward. I ordered samples before my cards...three weeks ago. Havent received anything yet. Now I know that the turnaround time on cards is between 12-14 days, but I didnt receive any confirmation that theyd been shipped, or what method they were being shipped through. Luckily I was able to call them and talk to people who straightened everything out, but I really get a strong feeling that theyre a very small company thats still trying to learn the ropes. The biggest problem I had was that my shipping and billing addresses are different. Theres a box where you type in your shipping address, then it takes you to the billing section. When I got my order confirmation, I noticed that my billing address and shipping address were listed as the same at the top of the order, then lower down in the order section was where I had typed in my correct shipping address, yet it was partially cut off. I called them about it and they assured me that it was shipping to the correct address, however once I called UPS and had them reassure me that my cards were coming to the correct address, I received another email from Taste saying that the reason my samples werent delivered was because I didnt give them the correct address. I looked back at my confirmation receipt and the correct address was typed into the bottom of my order. It was a matter of not paying attention I guess. Suggestions would be to either pay closer attention to their customers entire order, or to work on the billing/shipping page instead of leaving it as a box to type words in, especially if its not going to be read. Pros are that they get back to you very quickly and make sure that your custom order is correct for print. Cons seem to be the shipping and customer care portion. Will I order from them again? Possibly. But my trust has definitely been tested."
2,"I mean its a bar they have drinks. If that is what you are going for cool. You can catch a game there, its not bumpn like it used to. Its a little on the quiet side. The crowd looks like its about a 40+ group. and a good handful of random creepers checking out the serve staff there.  I wouldnt say i wont come back. But its definitely not first on my list for the kinda of bar scene id normally be looking for. Service was good. but thats because there wasnt many other people to serve the day when i went."
3,"I enjoyed my nights here.  The facilities are clean and very well maintained.  Housekeeping staff is fantastic also.  They were not intrusive and they were hospitable.   However, the ONE thing that bothered me was the reception staff.  I was mistreated.  I say this because I asked the reception staff a question about the pool hours and the response I received was ""Are you a guest here?""  Followed by ""because we get a lot of people around here...""  While that response is completely understandable, I must point out that I checked in an hour earlier with the SAME staff at the desk.  This may be me sounding like a self-centered, remember me-type of person, but no.  I felt that the receptionist was categorizing me because of my age and because of my look.  I guess I just look like the type that would crash into a hotel pool?  Mind you, this Residence Inn is adjacent to the Mayo Clinic and desert land.  Yes, the only two things around walking distance are this hotel and the hospital.  So apparently, this hotel pool must be the hot spot for pool crashers.  Must be all the sickly patients that want to take a dip in the pool.   Then on the same occasion, the same reception staff told me that they did not have a bottle opener at the desk.  There is a small convenient store next to the reception desk that sells wine, beer, water, soda, snacks, etc.  I purchased a beer and asked them if they had a bottle opener so I could drink my beer by the fire pits and they said no.  It had been misplaced.  Some time later, the nice gentleman that helped me open my beer got beers at the reception desk and somehow, they magically had a bottle opener.  Strange how they had one for him, but not for me.  Regardless, I was a bit bummed that the reception staff was childish and rude to me.  I felt like I was individually singled out to be discriminated against.  Its a shame too because I love my Marriott Rewards card.   The rooms are large here.  The elevator takes forever!  I suggest that the hotel adopt elevator music to distract the sluggish speed of that elevator."
5,"This place really made a terrible situation as easy as possible.  Our cat was hit by a car or beaten, and my husband found her immobile and crying horribly in pain.  We rushed her to the clinic, and the doctor saw her right away.  She told us our options, but was very upfront about the liklihood that our kitty would pass no matter what we did.  She didnt pressure us one way or another, and left the room so that we could talk privately and make our decision.  My husband asked if they could give her some pain meds while we talked about it, and they gave her some immediately. Once we made our difficult decision to put our kitty down, she brought the cat into a private room with us so that we could say goodbye.  She left us alone and gave us as much time as we needed.  She also let us be present in the room when they gave her the final shot.  At all times the doctor and the techs were compassionate and very respectful.  I was crying and they were very sensitive to my feelings.  They treated my little kitty so gently even after she had passed.  They even sent a sympathy card to our house a few days later.  I really appreciated how they helped us through this difficult time, and I would definitely reccommend them if anyone else is in a similar situation."
3,"Ahhh... Zinc.  Its been a while since I have left Paris.  Being a resident and citizen there for so long, I would like to think I can spot a decent French fare.  I have now been to Zinc three times, every time I ordered something different, so far the food has not dissapointed as much as the prices have.  Wow. Okay, okay, you have a spot in Scottdale, its a nice little posh area with plenty of traffic, designer furniture and nick-nack and artsy stores that typically have things that would require your to take out a 2nd mortgage to afford those things that often just gather dust, one season at a time at home.  You would think someone on that strip would be the one to say, lets have reasonable prices.  Zinc is not one of those. The restaurant has the name Bistro in it. They have folks dining out on the sidewalk, dining with noise and the occasional smell of BMW exausts...  Thats beautiful and very Parisian, also very Bistro.  Here is a wake up call though... Bistros offer fares with decent prices, a prix fixe menu and simply good simple food.   The prices were incredibly high for what you do get.  Unfortunately the charm of having an outdoor patio and serving fries in fake newspaper doesnt cut it.    The Steak Frites (a hanger steak w/ fries and a brandy sauce) is a French Bistro Classic, a staple if you will and that was the only thing that was fairly prices for what you get.  But if you knew how much those cuts are to get from a supplier, youd be asking questions about the prices even then. On two of those occasions we had cheese plates, it was more of a mix and match, you could pick from a few Chevres, Softs and hard cheeses,  they were incredibly small portions but the breads that came with the platter was very tasty, warm and fresh.  It is typically served with a ramkin of olives. So overall, sounds like I am bashing this restaurant, I am not but I am dieing to find a reason to go back because there is something good about it, the atmosphere, the lighting, the seasonal menu.  But little things keep me from enjoying Zinc.  Such as the time we sat at the secluded back part of the restaurant, the small courtyard.  Very charming, though some of the waiters, and cooks smoked right outside of the courtyards gates.  The smell of cheap cigarettes and mumbled chatter caused us to ask for another table, when we did, we were all the sudden looked as ""picky customers"".   One more tip Zinc, you may want to get the mall janitor to move his trash can from the view of your utmost beatiful courtyard, such promise, undelivered due to tacky flaws that could have been prevented by an attentive manager or even a caring waite staff. Dont miss:  Dining in the courtyard, or the sidewalk. Skip: Specials that are simply trendy"
5,"No rake, no annual membership or fees.  Just a fun ""home"" game in a strip mall minutes from my parents house.  They have 1-2 and 2-3 NL games and the min buy is $40, max is $500. Everyone is friendly and they offered us snacks and drinks while we played.  Since there isnt a rake or fee, dont be cheap (like one guy there) and tip the dealer generously."
4,Another new great place in the Arcadia neighborhood  to grab some great food and select a drink from the extensive beer and wine list.  I think there were over 60 beers and 40 wines to choose from.  I thoroughly enjoyed the tomato and candied pancetta bruschetta and the lamb kefta...yummy!  Definitely check this place out when the weather is cooler and you can enjoy the view of Camelback Mountain from the patio.
4,"I thought I disliked brownies, but these are damn good. In fact, every flavor is delicious. I was pleasantly surprised. Holla!"
5,"Everyone point and laugh at the nerd reviewing a convenience store. Oh yeah? Stuff it. Like donuts? Check this out. Get in your car and drive here around 3AM and try their donuts. Had every single donut place in the area, and nothing can hold a candle to the QT donuts.  My guy begrudgingly takes me here every couple of weeks for the donut stake out. Its so worth it.  They get hard during the day, so seriously - 3AM or bust."
5,"Tiffany @ the chanel counter.  Tana in the lingerie department.  these are my go-to girls for everything. i bring all of my purchases to them bc they are THAT much better than everyone else. except shoes because the shoe people know how to work that confusing back shoe room.  but everything else: make up, accessories, clothes....all to one of these girls. i recommend you only work with them as well :)"
4,"Perfect place for b-day dinner with the family.  Happy hour out on the patio, margaritas, sushi rolls, won tons, pad thai.  All very tasty, great prices, good service.  Overall, I think this is one of my favorite local restaurants.  Not a big fan of chains, however I dont really feel like its in that category."
3,Two stars because there isnt a drive thru.. and Im a lazy American who forgot that when you live abroad you walk for coffee and your needs.. Three stars because the peeps working are as friendly as it gets.. but the sugar/condiment bar is dirty.. clean it up Starbucks!
4,"I used to live off this place. They cut their meats and cheeses fresh like a real deli, so already it kicks the shit out of Subway, Quiznos, and every other fast food deli chain that offers up pre-packaged meats. Their bread and cookies are fresh as well. For some reason, this location has better tasting food than any other Port-o-Subs Ive been to. Dont know why. Theres always a long line at lunch, but it moves fast. Theres some good people watching to be done here - cops eat here, firemen eat here, doctors and nurses eat here, and you also get the entire spectrum of downtown Scottsdale folk... sometimes you would think you arrived at a costume party or they are filming a new Village People video. I dont know what it is and I dont know that it matters either, but good looking people eat here. Whatever you want to make of that...  Most of the people that work here are really nice and competent. They keep this place pretty clean as well. Once I noticed some fruit flies buzzing around by the soda machine and was told they sometimes come with the fresh fruit they get for the smoothies (which are fantastic). Outside of that, I cant complain about this sub shop and I eat here all the time... its almost just about as good as a non-chain place."
5,"This is the best buffet in Az. HUGE variety from veggie dishes, fish, shrimp, mussels, and even sushi. The quality of food is very good too. One thing I have learned is when looking for good Asian food, look inside! This place is always full of beautiful asian folks so you know its good. Just sayin. For a buffett, they have a really nice staff. There is a shrimp dish with a sweet cream sauce that is amazing. It is more pricey than most asian buffets but well worth the extra few bucks. I eat here at least once every couple weeks."
4,"Camelback Mountain is a well-known landmark and popular hiking spot. And for good reason. The mountain boasts spectacular views from the highest point in Phoenix. Even though the mountain is easily accessible from almost anywhere in the Valley, it can feel like a million miles away from the citys teeming malls and freeways.  The 1.16 mile Summit Trail is one of the most popular hikes in the area. It therefore may surprise you just how steep it gets or how winded you may become when hiking it. Just bring plenty of water and dont overdo, unless your path to 15-minutes of fame includes a sheriffs department rescue on the evening news..."
4,"VOODOO Chicken was fantastic!  Most of the entree selections were available over rice or pasta.  They had many gluten free options and they use brown rice and brown pasta. I stumbled upon Jaspers Peak Bistro on accident and I am glad I did.  Cajun inspired food cooked well.  Very satisfying and delicious. The server was a bit neglectful, but we were loving our food so much and the company of friends that we didnt mind so much.  The neglectful server did recommend the food we ordered and we were very happy with it."
4,Good boutique hotel with nice amenities. Clean and contemporary Id definitely stay here again!
5,Great place to take the kids to play and have some bbq. Nice outdoor area and good solid bbq.
5,"I almost NEVER give a chain restaurant a 5-star review, not because Im opposed to the idea but because very few are worthy. But Bandera is just that good, from the upscale casual, relaxed and inviting atmosphere to the excellent service to the delicious food. Ordering the cornbread to start is a must - itd be a crime not to. The grilled artichoke and queso/guacamole apps are also wonderful. I had the macho salad, which was quite large and packed with good stuff. I also had a side of the mac and cheese that was outrageously good. Dessert offerings are limited to two choices, and neither blew me away, but the Oreo one was the better of the two. Bandera is, like its sister restaurant Houstons, always a wonderful experience with reliably terrific food."
4,"Seriously, their happy hour prices cant be beat.  A beer, a spicy tuna roll, calamari and avocado egg roll for under $20 including tip.  Service was attentive and friendly.  We had to lurk around the bar area for awhile to get a table, but that only speaks to how popular this place is.  If you are looking for an inexpensive dinner out that doesnt involve Dennys or Olive Garden this is a great choice."
4,"Mostly rave reviews on Yelp led me to Le Chalet, a unique little indie restaurant amid the strip malls and Super Targets of the West Valley. Despite the fifty-some-odd write-ups, I wasnt sure what to expect. I read something about an ice cave, live comedy, hanging man meat, and surveillance cameras, but despite these oddities what drew me in was the promise of expertly crafted crepes and the opportunity to see the chefs do their stuff on a closed circuit TV. Le Chalet did not disappoint. Sit in the front dining area to view the chefs at work in the open kitchen, or take a seat in the dining area by the bar where two flat screens showcase the action at the crepe griddles. The Bretonne crepe with ham, mushrooms, Swiss cheese, and a sunny-side up egg was superb, and I cant wait to go back and try the La Landaise, blinis topped with seared fois gras, apple, and balsamic glaze. I also tried La Potence (the ""hanging man""), filet medallions served on a medieval looking mace, seared tableside with bourbon and served with a pineapple slice, rice, and some mayo-based dipping sauces. Thoroughly enjoyable, but next time I would opt instead for a cheese fondue or the melted Raclette plate with cured meats, which looked delicious. The ambiance seemed a bit strange to me, but homey and comfortable. And yes, there is a sculpted ice cave for performances, The night I attended was slated for ""clean comedy"" and I made it a point to get out of there despite some morbid curiosity (Im not an amateur comedy fan, and the idea of family-friendly comedy made me even more anxious). The handsome server was very attentive and knowledgeable, and I loved the half-carafe option when ordering wine. I wouldnt classify Le Chalet as a ""fondue place"", where the experience often outshines the food; its more of a casual cozy spot that serves up thoughtfully prepared comfort cuisine - all the ingredients for a lovely dinner out."
4,"In the interest of full disclosure the only thing I every really go here for is the lunch buffet but wow, what a great buffet! I believe the buffet itself is about $10 and for that you get a wide range of vegetarian items and as with other items on the buffet most of those get changed out over time so you get a rotation of various dishes as you come back. They also have hummus and baba ghanoush (like hummus but made with eggplant instead of chickpeas). There is generally at least one dish with red meat (today it was a tomato based stew with eggplant and either beef or lamb) and usually two dishes with chicken. I generally get iced tea to go with the meal and one thing to note, they do not serve alcohol so if you want to go someplace where you can also have a drink or two, this would not be a good place to go but if you just want a place with really good Middle Eastern food (the owners told me it is really Lebanese cooking but Im going to just generalize and say for most of us, when you try it, you will think Middle Eastern). Of course, you can walk a block or two to 4 peaks brewery, in the same area, and have a drink or two before or after you your meal.  One really nice thing about this place it is right off the Apache stop on the light rail and right across the road (same side of the street) is Pita Jungle so a wide range of good food options right off that light rail stop. Bottom line, Ive never had anyone Ive taken here NOT like it and everyone who has gone has wanted to go back again. I like it for lunch during the workday because it is quick and you have a wide variety of regularly changed out tasty food options, so I recommend you give it a try if you have the time. :-)"
4,"Delish! We drove around looking for a good steak without a wait and ended up at the Phoenician. With the restaurant concept by Jean Georges, we knew we were in for a treat.  The only reasons Im giving 4 stars are two-fold: The shrimp cocktail was overpriced - $18 for 5 shrimp? Cmon...yummy but lame. And The desert menu is seriously lacking - I was expecting to see at least one amazing thing and they were all boring: cake, apple fritter, cheesecake, gelato...boring!! Other than that, everything was amazing. Im getting over a cold and they brought me out my own tea kettle which sat next to the table and stayed hot for two hours. And the finishing salt they provided in a tiny bowl was a great touch! Order a steak, itll be cooked perfectly with a great crust on it. Have them bring all the sauces too; their bernaise is ridiculously fluffy - they infuse it with liquid nitrogen!!  And the beurre blanc is perfect and delicate. YUM (PS, if you get Mercedes as your server, youre in for a treat! Shes amazing!)"
1,"We had read good things about Over Easy, and were excited to try it out. We went a few days after Christmas, and were horribly disappointed. When we walked in, we were seated by one server. Then, a few minutes later, another host came up to us and asked why we stole a table and did we not understand how seating works? We were quite confused and offended, as we were seated properly and had done nothing wrong. Then, once we ordered, we waited over 45 minutes for our food. Finally, we asked about it, and then it was out within a few minutes. They had completely lost our order. When our food arrived, one dish (the Over Easy -- toasted brioche with spinach & an egg) was absolutely inedible. The brioche was so burnt that we could barely cut it, as was the bacon. The fried egg was very undercooked, even though we requested it completely cooked through. I was honestly shocked the server brought us the dish without saying anything, since it was clearly burnt. The other 2 dishes (banana & pecan french toast, and the Loretta sandwich) were just alright -- certainly nothing to rave about. And, the 3 of us ended up splitting these 2 dishes, since the other dish was awful. We ended up leaving early because we were all so disappointed. At which point, our server asked if wed like a box for our uneaten burnt brioche. It would have been much more appropriate for her to ask if there was something wrong with it, since it was obviously not eaten. Anyway, Im not sure if we just caught them on a bad day, but I would never go back again or recommend Over Easy to anyone else."

5,"Fine dining is not just a setting.  it isnt just good food.  It is many things that add up to an attitude. I have had the opportunity to find it in different cities. I found it the other night at the Stockyards. We were seated by a host who took us to our table and when we were properly seated gave us menus.  Our server came to the table and introduced herself and said she would return shortly.  It was nice to have a moment to chat before we had to think about ordering.  When she did return,  our glasses were filled-not something we should have  to wait for her to do when the service is right.  She knew the selections on the menu and all available options and could make sensible comments concerning them.  Our salads were served promptly by two additional people and were as fresh as I could ask for.  When my friend was finished with hers they asked if they could take her plate.  I was pleased when they didnt ask me if I was finished with my salad and could they take my plate.  If Id been finished I could have told them.  We were able to continue our conversation uninterrupted as I finished my salad.  The salad plate was removed  when it was appropriate and we had a few minutes before the entrees were served.  All was in keeping with a relaxed dining.  At no time did I have to think about having drinks refilled, it just happened quietly. After a few minutes our dinners were served by the two gentlemen and our server appeared to make sure they were to our satisfaction before we started.  There was no room for error there that couldnt be resolved before we started.   My friend had ordered a small steak. My friend is  quite elderly and Kathy, our server, discretely asked her if shed like it cut for her.  A potato also was served with her dish.  I asked my friend which of the condiments she would like it prepared with.  She look at me and said ""Prepared with?"" She didnt understand what I was getting at but Kathy did and was already reaching for the potato.   She opened the potato and smiled while my friend said a bit of everything.  One doesnt go to a restaurant like the stockyards to have to deal with opening a hot potato and preparing it.   When serving is done properly, these things dont have to be discussed.  Kudos to, Kathy!!!.  That is part of the fine dining experience. I had a full rack of ribs which were so tender the meat fell of them.  The sauce had spice to it but not so strong the flavor of the meat was concealed.  I also can tell you that unless you are a big eater, half a rack would fill most people.  My friend said, ""Yummy!""  and I agreed.  I am used to getting a finger bowl for clean up after eating, but I cant complain about the two extra napkins and several ways of cleaning my fingers that accompanied my ribs.   My friend let them know we were celebrating the 17th anniversary of my 39th birthday so they served me a free desert.  I can assure you the pecan pie is a delight!  Warm and laced with brandy, it was perfect way to finish our dinner. The stockyards, I might mention, is not inexpensive, but what an enjoyable way to spend your money. They do offer two dinner specials you wont find at most other places.  They do have a luncheon menu that has lower prices.   Dont expect chrome and music that is a bit to loud as many of the new places offer.  Instead, just enjoy a time and place where they pamper you as you should be when you go to the Stockyards. I dont consider the stockyards to be a place you where shorts and Nikes, but of course there are always a few.  I would say a nice shirt and slacks at least."
4,This is a cool venue to catch a show. I actually played a show here and it was good times. They have a large dance floor or an area where people can gather to watch performers. They also have a nice sized Bar which can handle a good sized crowd. We all know that is a must when it comes getting a drink in a crowed venue. I really enjoyed this spot and had a fun time rocking peoples face off!
4,"This was our second visit to Chelseas Kitchen.  They have valet parking available, but there is lots of self parking in the same parking lot.  Its quicker just to self park. We sat indoors both times.  When the weather is right, the outdoor patio is popular, but I prefer indoor seating.  It feels comfortable sitting inside.  The way the tables and booths are set up it feels comfortable, and not crowded.  The spacing is just right.  During peak times, there is a full bar inside to relax while you wait for a table. We started with tuna tartare, guacamole and chips.  It was a good choice.  We also ordered some beer.  The beer choices were limited.  The table next to us had a pitcher of sangria ... that looked like the better choice. For dinner we had the short rib tacos and the ahi tuna.  My son had the kids meal mac and cheese.  Ive had the short rib tacos both times Ive been here, and its outstanding.  The braised meat is tender, and served with corn tortillas, beans, guac, tomatoes, etc.  All of our meals were good, but the short rib tacos were the best. For dessert we shared the red velvet cake.  It comes with a small scoop of vanila ice cream.  It could have come with a little more ice cream.  The cake was moist and not too sweet.  It was gone in a minute.   The bill for four including drinks and tip was $120. On the way out, they have chocolate chip cookes with sea salt sprinkled on top.  A nice touch.  My son grabbed two cookies, and finished them on the drive back to the hotel.  Great dinner!"
4,"I have been going to Top Shelf for almost 30 years.  I grew up eating their shredded beef burritos at the Scottsdale and Shea location which has since closed.  I dont live in Mesa, but any time I have a chance and am in the neighborhood, I stop by the Southern and Dobson location.  The shredded beef has not changed and is probably some of the best shredded beef you will find in AZ.  Their margaritas are tasty and their chips and salsa are amazing.  This is a great place for a tasty Mexican food dinner."
5,"Love this place! A must stop for anyone downtown needing a snack or a drink! Very good happy hour and unbelievable flavor combinations. On my last visit, I was pleased to try some happy hour toasts and fish and chips. Zero disappointment."
1,"This is one of the franchise store of Ritz Camera in Chandler. The stores staffs are nice, however, their photo lab is miss leading. They make the price in very small fonts and hanging on the ceiling.  For the first time user to print photos in the lab, I was charged for $45 for just few 4x6 and 8x10 print without sign-in as member. I asked for canceling order prior they print the photos. I was told ""Too late"" even its still in one of their store pc for ordering prints.  Since they are franchise, I should be able to return or exchange the accessories I bought for my Nikon D70S camera in different store. I was told ""No"". I can only exchange or return to the stores I purchase them.  I will not buy anything from them again."
3,"decently priced Korean food. they offer more soups and korean style casseroles - no dolsot bibimbap, BUT their kalbi tang is reallllly good! Huge bowl, lots of kalbi, yum yum yum! theyre also open a lot later than many other restaurants, always a plus!"
1,Not only was the music the worst I have ever heard the wait staff was as annoying as ever! Like a wanna be swanky place in a strip mall that smells like fish and plays horrible music. Food was so so but over priced for what it was.
2,"I have been here about 3 times, twice  for the weekend breakfast buffet and once for lunch. The food is similar to Dennys, so nothing special here. Everything here feels dingy and dirty, there was hair in one of the dishes in the buffet. Service is average, but employees are just as dirty looking as the restaurant..will not be coming here anymore."
5,"Full disclosure: one way or another, I have only been to Roaring Fork for the Happy Hour, but the happy hour is darn good. You can, and you should, get that kettle of green chili pork or the big-ass burger, or better yet, share the two with someone nice. The huckleberry margarita is so good, Ive had three in one sitting (no, I wasnt driving!). I fully intend to get over there for dinner soon, because I keep seeing the sugar cured duck on the menu and just thinking about it right now my mouth is watering. It gets pretty busy during the happy hour, though, so be prepared to wait a little if your party is large."
2,"Ok, so weve been here  a total of two times... the first was a pretty good experience... not memorable, but ok. Then we went again, last night for Mothers Day. My Dad wanted the Trout so bad, so us Mothers gave in. The only positive thing to say about them is how nice they were, we called to see if we could get in at for dinner at 8:30pm, (they closed at 9pm) they said not a problem. I was kinda impressed cuz weve called other restaraunts and they have turned us down in the same senario.... when we sat down, we ordered right away, it took awhile for us to get our food, i finally had to flag our waitress down and ask her to bring whatever was ready whenever it was ready. My salad was probably the best thing I had that night next to the water. Come on tho, how hard is it to mess up salad and a water! My Dad had the trout, he finished it but said it wasnt the best, my Mom had the Chicken Parmesean. She picked around the stuff she didnt like. I ordered a coconut shrimp apetizer, it arrived cold. The bill for two adult entrees and one appetizer a small ceaser salad and one childs meal was $80....  we still tipped $20, but $100 for one of the worst meals in a long time wasnt worth it. We wont be back at least for awhile."
1,"This Jack in the Box location has the worst service & food that I have found in the Phoenix metro area. Every time I have gone through the drive through there my order has either been wrong or inedible - how hard is it to make a taco without frying it into oblivion? The wait times are consistently more than 5 minutes...I think I will be spending that 5 minutes driving to another location, just to get the correct order & food that is properly prepared."
5,Ive been coming here for years...the best.  One of my favs is the lulu wings.
5,.:chomp:. this is one .:mmmghgh:. good burger .:sllluuuurrrpp:. Its got a great combination of yumminess with a side of .:chomp:. awesomeness. The burgers are great and .:chomp:. perfect.  The custard is great .:lick:. and diabetic friendly .:mmmmmmm:.(They have no sugar added custard). i would definitely recommend this place! .:lick:.
3,"Totally sufficient for a few rounds of pool or darts while keeping an eye on the 67 tv screens they have mounted on the walls. Just stick to the cheap pitchers of domestic beer. I ordered a rum and coke and it tasted like cleaning products.  I would come back, but only if I didnt feel like driving all the way to Lucky Break in Tempe."
2,"Its not that I dont like this place, its just that its very run of the mill. Bison Witches does the standard sports bar cum college drinking hole thing. Thats all that can really be said about this place. You cant really hate this place for that because it is what it is. A milquetoast spot at its most average.."
5,"Arai pastry is so delicious! ironically i come here not for the sweeties: confections, cakes, cookies, cremes, not being my style- but for their delicious savory treats! The breads they make here are top knotch, the various salty pastries are all worth exploring, the red bean one and the curry filled ones being my favorites. But the real deal, the Coup de grâce, the mamoth reason of what makes this little japanese pastry shop (in my mind) is their sandwhiches/ green tea shakes that powerful one two punch of savory sagacity is what makes me want to live sometimes yes yes i find the world to be a better place with those items in my tummy"
2,"Definitely a place where the reputation precedes the actual experience. Its like its trying to be Binkleys, and its not even in the same ballpark. We were there on a THU night, and the place was dead.  Still, it seemed to take 30 minutes between courses.  Which is fine, if you have some bread or amuse bouche between.  Which you dont at Posh.  So, you eat your tasting portion in 4 minutes, then you sit there for another 26.  By the time the 3rd course came of our 5th course meal at hour one and a half, we were all tired, bored, and no longer hungry.  We ended up asking our last course to be wrapped, as we were that turned off. What really disturbed me on the food, however, was the foie gras.  An extra $15 supplement - which is fine, as I think its always worth it for great foie gras.  We were presented a plate with nice size piece of foie gras, in a fruit coulis, and what looked like a nice brulee crust on one side.  It looked amazing.  And was, if I stopped at eye appeal.  Unfortunately, Chef decided to go way off the grid, and serve it COLD.  Im not talking room temp, Im talking refrigerator cold.  If you are a foie gras fan, then you know this is like eating a square of lard.  It was impalitable.  Imagine being served a lump of shortening on a plate, because this is what cold foie gras tastes like.   I like the surprise aspect of the courses, and I like the fact you can tell them what you like and dont like to start, but ultimately, I see now why its best to know exactly what youre getting in advance.   It took me about 10 minutes to figure out why the whole concept of Posh fails.  The dining experience starts when youre wowed by a menu, and sit in anticipation of what youve ordered.  When you have no expectations, its hard to get excited.  By the time the plate is dropped and the server is telling you how your fluke is in a mascerated lima bean sauce with a marigold flower garnish and buttermilk glaze, youre not really into the ingredients, and just want to eat.  I had to ask my server to repeat every course I was served at least twice - lol. Perhaps if I hadnt been spoiled by Binkleys, that has an expansive menu that changes daily, and you pick from 4-7 courses BUT you are given about 6-8 amuse bouche (and bread which is served French style with choices) between courses, I suppose I would have been more impressed with Posh.  But not by much..."
4,"Best prices in Phoenix nice ladies,   will do exactly what you ask with your hair"
4,"had lunch here today outside with the girlfriend and my mother. I have to say we were pretty blown away with the size of the hummus plate, 3 pieces of pita with a good 3/4 to full cup of hummus, for under 4 bucks.  I had the chicken pita, tasted great  had onion, tomato, cucumber, and  tzataiki, freakin awsome! my girlfriend had the gyro pita and loved it. My mom had the lamb pita and says it was awsome... unfortunantly we were all being greedy and didnt want to share our pitas. I also ordered two falafel, best ive found, crunchy outside with a crazy mixture of being dense and light, you could taste all the flavor on the front of your tongue and the spice at the back of your tongue. Well be heading  back pretty soon I hope.  Also Lisa I think we spotted you there sitting outside. not sure it was you since you where sitting behind me and next to some folks with their dog."
5,"My favorite Starbucks in Mesa. Its not even the closest one to my home, but worth the experience. GREAT staff."
2,"trendy, loud-music, ok-sushi! - 2/5 When we lived right across the street from the Sushi Brokers, J and I used to go there at least once a month for its happy hour. We probably had been there at least 8 times with friends and family. I have to say that the quality was good for the start but went downhill since then. The price was right if you go during the happy hour. Other time, kinda expensive with the quality and service. It was a seen-to-be-seen place with ok-quality sushi."
3,"Person 1: ""So, where do you want to go to lunch?"" Person 2: ""Hmmm.  Im not sure"" Person 1: ""Want to go to Paradise?"" Person 2: ""Naaah, weve been there three times recently."" Person 1: ""What about Subway?"" Person 2: ""Im so damned tired of sandwiches. . ."" Person 1: ""Well, heres Qdoba."" Person 2: ""Qdoba?  Okay, I havent been there in a while.  We can get in and out pretty quickly and get back to work."" Thats pretty much how it is.  Nobody really plans to go out and eat at Qdoba.  Its one of those places you decide to go to on the fly or because youve eaten everywhere else. The Mexifood is fair.  Nothing special, nothing bad, nothing to distinguish it.  Theres tons of Mexican joints within ten miles that are better, but Qdobas here in this strip mall.  Havent eaten here in a while and dont want to drive any further?  This will make a nice alternative, and then youll be good on this place for another six months or so. . ."
5,"great sports bar. TVs galore. Good food. Outside patio. While many places claim to be sports bars, for some reason they wind up not paying attention to the TVs and wind up with hair removal infomercials playing. This place knows what they are doing with the tvs. I was watching the manager who looked like had a spreadsheet with every game planned out and on what tvs. They also play the sound from the premier game."
3,"I love Greek food, but I need to stop letting my friends drag me to this restaurant. The staff is extremely friendly and the place is comfortable, but for me the food is always a disappointment. I know I know, its a chain... and maybe I just have high expectations, being that Im from back east where we have small family-run Greek restaurants on every corner."
5,"Owned and operated by Eugenia Theodosopoulos (an Ohio native, fyi) and considered by many to be the best patisserie/bakery in the state I approached Essence with a note of skepticism largely assuming much of the hype was derived from Tempes plethoric college crowd but arriving at the doors of the small shop on a particularly lovely 80 degree morning I gathered quite quickly that my original conceptions were misplaced; not only does Essence not look like a college haunt, neither do its prices or products - a vast selection of at least twenty items aside from the posted menu sitting beneath and atop a glass case forcing me to make more than one tough decision that was not helped by my servers accurate assessment that everything was really good. Now bearing in mind that the original impetus to visit Tempe on this particular morning was to visit Caffe Boa and that Essence was more of pre-meal activity what follows may seem slightly gluttonous, but to be fair once I took my first bite of Theodosopouloss École Lenôtre trained almond croissant I knew I was in good hands and everything else just sort of followed.  Without a doubt my favorite breakfast pastry and perhaps my favorite French pastry overall, Essences $3 twice baked option arrives slightly smaller than the average but with a shell that crackles to the tooth and an interior that is at once yawning pockets of air and nearly overloaded with butter and light frangipane there is no doubt that this is a case of ""big things in small packages,"" and particularly in its still-warm morning state the flavors and textures rivaled those at Dominique Ansel and Payard Las Vegas for best Ive had stateside. Moving next from the baked goods to one prepared from the menu my second taste of the morning aside from the slightly earthy and lightly leather accented coffee was Essences ""Signature"" French Toast, a $7.25 selection featuring three griddled slices of eggy brioche and a sidecar of what I can best describe as banana infused caramel.  Rich but thinly sliced and therefore nicely saturated each piece of the French Toast was exactly as it should be - the exterior crisp and the interior custard-while the sauce provided a pleasant balance of fruity notes and intrinsic sweetness that complimented rather than overwhelming the bread. At this point submitting to the fact that I was going to eat even the items Id bought for later, my next two tastes were a pair of $2.95 macarons that, much like the croissant, rivaled those both here and abroad in terms of taste and texture while opting for a much more rustic approach terms of size and presentation.  Beginning first with Pumpkin Spice and then proceeding to Vanilla with Dark Rum each palm-sized cookie was exactly what one would expect from a well trained pastry chef as the exterior shell provided a slight crackle on bite subsequently giving way to a soft meringue followed by dense cream that slowly dissipated on the tongue - the cinnamon and nutmeg notes of the former particularly notable while the rum in the second was appropriately understated thus serving to highlight the vanilla of the shell. If there were any misstep on the morning, it *might* have been the ""Summer Berry Croissant Bread Pudding,"" though when I say misstep I must temper the comment with the fact that my quibble is only that I prefer the French/English take on the dish while this one was more based on the French Custard style, a rich vanilla bean pudding without a lot of crunch or textural variance but instead laden with blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries plus a sidecar of lightly sugared strawberries.  Focusing more of the natural sweetness of the fruits and aromatics of the vanilla than the typical overly sweet versions served stateside it was more panna cotta than bread pudding to me, but chalking that up to personal tastes it was still delicious. Moving last to the one dish that gave me trepidation, the ""French Napoleon"" gave caused pause not only because the name clearly skewed towards a subset unfamiliar with a proper Mille-Feuille but also because so many pre-made versions of this layered pastry have failed to wow in the past...thankfully this was not the case at Essence.  Featuring light and crunchy layers of choux easily withstanding the tines of a fork without turning into a smooshy mess (see ""Mille Feuille New York"") intertwined with rich pastry cream speckled with dots of vanilla bean and ripe raspberries what truly made this version stand out was the manner in which Theodosopoulos caramelized each layer of choux, a technique reminiscent of Pierre Herme and as good as the French icons version was Id be hard pressed to say Essences was any less impressive.  It would be awesome to see what they could do a la minut like Savoy, LArpege, or Genin and given the names Ive dropped in the paragraphs above plus Essences proximity Ive no doubt Ill be returning to see what else the small shop is capable of soon."
5,"I went to the physical location the first time with my dog Foxy to scope out the place.  The store inside is iitttyyy bitttyyy and not worth going to in all honesty, but the staff that work there are REALLY friendly, and helpful.  Foxy eats Evangers, which is really hard to find, and the only place I knew of that carried it was 20min away from me.       A month later, I run out of dog food....so I call Goober (after research I find they sell Evangers for the cheapest price) and they delivered it right to me.  I wasnt home so they left it on my front porch along with a pretty large amount of free dog treats for Foxy !  They left their newsletter, some reference cards, and their product list (which is HUUUUGGGEEE) in a bag hanging from my door.  The reference cards you give out will earn you discounts on your next purchase!  Oh of course- I forgot to mention the delivery was completely FREE of charge!!!  Ill never get my dog food anywhere else."
3,Ra Sushi offers average sushi grade.  This chain of restaurants offers a hip atmosphere with loud music and a great place to take down some drinks while eating.   As an Asian Im a little more passionate about the rating topic for Ra.  If you dont have much  to say about a restaurant please think about rating it four stars.
5,"Definitely one of my favorite places to eat, hands down.  I love their enchiladas verdes combo.  Their refried beans are THE BEST!  I have been eating here for over 15 years and the waitresses are mostly the same.  Definitely feels like you are at an old friends house when you are there.  Yes, it is in a bad area, but that hasnt ever deterred me from telling everyone I know that if they want really good, real Mexican food at a great price, to head down there.  And their green salsa for dipping chips is amazing."
5,"My daughter and I really love it here.  I always walk in without an appointment and I never have to wait more than a few minutes.  The staff is very friendly, talented and professional.  Highly recommended!"
3,"Well it was off to Brio last night for ""date"" night!!!   The last time we were at Brio was in September to celebrate our 16th Anniversary...yes consecutive years, and it was a great evening!  Last night, no so much.  In all the years weve been going to Brio, we have NEVER had such HORRIBLE service....ever! The food was as amazing as it always is, but the terrible service completely overshadowed the tasty treats from the kitchen.  Our server stood and waited for us to finish sitting and before we could even open our napkins was asking for our drink order, not a good sign of things to come.  So I opted for water to come while we contemplated our cocktails.  So the water came, then nothing....nothing....no one....nada.  After about 10 minutes the server returned for our cocktail order.  The longest 10 minutes in history Ill admit.  So off to get the drinks....15 minutes later they arrived with the bread for the table...now mind you wed been sitting alone at the table with no attention for 25 minutes now.  That is a lifetime for a restaurant that makes their money by turning tables.  When the drinks and bread arrived we opted to put in our dinner order, thinking wed be in for a long bumpy night.  So we ordered, I ordered the Campanelle Carbonara, but with the Spicy Pepper Sauce from the Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant Appetizer, as opposed to the traditional sauce.  The server said no problem, you want the Angel Hair Pasta with the Spicy Sauce, do you want to add Shrimp or Chicken???  Well the Campanelle Carbonara comes with Chicken, Spinach, Bacon, and Parmesan Cheese.  So I explained it is NOT Angel hair Pasta as the Campanelle is a trumpet shaped pasta with curled edges.  He said ""Oh you want the Lasagna Noodles"".....!  Of course I just said ask the chef to prepare the entree as he usually would, BUT, substitute the sauces.  Glenn ordered the same, but with the traditional sauce.  We both opted for the wedge salad, and asked that our entrees not be fired until we were completed with our salad.  After all, we all know all the ingredients are pre-made, and just needed to be assembled and heated..  Whew...I felt...that was exhausting!  Then the salads arrived.  Ice cold, yummy...!  Now we are back on track.  Boy that salad does hit all the notes that take you back to your childhood.  Nothing is better than Ice Cold Iceberg Lettuce w/blue cheese dressing, bacon crumbles, and fresh shaved Parmesan cheese!!!   Then it happened.....yes just as we thought, in order to speed up the process that started so slowly............our entrees arrive BEFORE we were even 1/2 way through our salads.  So there they sit...all beautiful, completed just as ordered...and no Lasagna Noodles, no Angel Hair Pasta...just the wonderfulness awaiting our forks.  But...yes...But, wed not finished our salads.  By the time we did, our pasta was sad, cold, and looked like it had let us down.  It didnt, OUR SERVER DID....oh by the way were we EVER asked if we wanted anything else to drink???  You guessed it NO....were we EVER asked how our dinner was???  You guessed it NO... Now youre probably saying, why didnt you do something about it?  Wed have loved to, but there was no one around...not even someone to fill our water glasses.  Only after we were finished with our sad, cold, entrees and had stacked all the dirty dishes in a pile on the edge of the table, did our server make an appearance to ask how our dinner is going??? Are you kidding me???  We just asked for the check.  Upon his return we presented him with the discount that Brio had sent us for being frequent diners, he took that and never returned.  After sitting there at an empty table, empty water glasses and nothing to look at but the crumbs left behind from the wonderful flat bread.  We placed cash on the table and left to try to reclaim our evening.  On the way out, Glenn finally spotted a manager and explained our evening and that it would be a VERY LONG time before we tried Brio again.  He, the manager, just stumbled over his words and said he wished hes known about our evening so he could have done something about it.  Well maybe if hed been circulating on the floor as opposed to hanging out with the ever so cute hostess hed have known.  Do we still like Brio...YES...are we extremely disappointed with our service last night...YES....."
4,"Garlic roasted potatoes *check* Amazing hummus and baba ganoush *check* Cute waitresses, some of which are babes *check* Inexpensive menu with quality ingredients *check* There are many Mediterranean restaurants around Tempe that vary in quality and service. Pita Jungle seems to break the mold. Theres something for everyone on their menu, be it the Mediterranean Chicken Salad or the Glazed Chicken Lavosh Pizza (both are awesome).  Pita Jungle is located off of Apache Blvd very close to the campus of Arizona State University. While this location is a favorite along the student body, a good mix of locals and students come here. The waitresses are very friendly and especially professional for a restaurant that serve so many college students. Like I mentioned above, many of the waitresses are super cute. Here is a meal of champions that I personally recommend 1. Start off with the baba ganoush with chicken. This is not on the menu, but hummus with chicken is, so just as for this. You get a large portion of freshly made baba ganoush covered with chopped roasted chicken. This is DELICIOUS. 2. For your main course, order the Lavosh Shawarma Wrap. This is chicken breast with grilled tomatoes and onions with garlic sauce in a crispy pita wrap (lavosh). This comes with a Greek Salad, but theyll be happy to sub the salad for the garlic roasted potatoes for no charge. 3. Finish your meal with the Baklava coupe. This comes with 3 types of ice cream (I remember it comes with pistachio ice cream!), and it comes with pieces of baklava. So delicious. Even if you feel full, once you see this, your stomach will magically make room. Pita Jungle gets a solid 4 stars from me. For a Tempe restaurant, I would give it an easy 5 stars, but with all things considered equal around Phoenix, Ill give it a solid 4."
3,"Narcisse couldnt be more appropriately named...another Scottsdale scene club with a lively but predictable crowd of scantily dressed cougars, Middle Eastern royalty and upscale business folk. The music is hoppin and thumpin late and leans toward House, which is why I added two stars. We actually entered by taking an elevator up and walking through a kitchen in rather cinematic style, emerging right onto the dance floor, which was packed. I guess it pays to know someone. The champagne selection is outrageous here and packed though it was, our drinks arrived in seconds. The sky-high patio is a nice place to chill and check out the little skyline, but its all about getting your dance on here. I would like to check it out for happy hour when fewer people are bumping into you and stepping on your feet. The Russian mobster-channeling bouncers are a little intimidating, but treated us well. An uber enthusiastic dancer knocked into my friend and shattered her Veuve glass, and all was whisked and mopped in seconds. The music sure beats the tired 90s cover bands that seem to be epidemic in this area."
4,"I love their wheat bread,  and I love that I can get sprouts and avocado on a sub.    Four different iced teas (unsugared, sugared, sugared green, and raspberry i think) is nice too.    The staff at this location always seems like theyre having fun,  which may not necessarily make the sandwich taste better but makes the overall experience of buying lunch a bit more pleasant.      Of the locally available chain sub shops (Subway, Blimpie, Port of Subs, Goodcents, Cousins, and Im probably forgetting some..),  Silver Mine is easily my favorite."
5,"I work on a local event called Ignite Phoenix, and somewhere in the mix we contacted Splinter Creative about helping us with the design and material for our event. We were completely new to this game and didnt really know what good branding and imagery could do for us. They stepped in, gave us some amazing ideas, helped us refine them, and delivered some incredible material that wowed everyone who attended. So we asked them to stick with us for our next event, and they did it again. They keep upping the game, and I now work with them across several different business that I work on.  Theyve helped me through several difficult creative areas, and the end result is always sharp, professional, interesting, and engaging.   I prefer to work with people who are passionate about what they do, and do it well.  Splinter fits that bill perfectly.  Highly recommended."
5,Try the Moroccan Chicken on the low calorie menu.  I was really surprised at how great it is.
4,"I absolutely love this regional park! The only pitfall is the cost of admission.....Seems to me that a park should be free to enter but I understand that there are costs for maintenance as well. Buying an annual park pass makes the most sense if you plan on making repeat visits. Beautiful views of the valley from any trail. All levels of intensity for hiking, biking and the like. Hard to believe the mountain is surrounded by houses because it seems so serene when visiting."
5,"Attention all parents, nannies, guardians etc.  Koko bees is tons of fun!  The kids are all smiles & full of laughter.  Terrific environment:  oodles of play houses,  dress ups, costumes, toys, themes & settings!  The little ones imaginations can run wild.  They even offer fantastic dance, sports, yoga and tumbling classes for the children!  This is a great place to come with the kiddos!!"
3,"Hit or miss. Pretty much the perfect definition of the ""HoHo"".  My friend and I like to come before shows and for happy hour (super cheap draft beers and wells), the well drinks are usually a little weak but being so cheap I cant blame them. Tuesdays are taco day and they have some pretty decent deals. Each day of the week has a ""special"" as far as food goes, its average to below average bar food. There are some games and shuffleboard as mentioned in previous reviews. TVs scattered all along the sitting area and a sizeable patio for the smokers. The bartenders are the real hit or miss part of the experience. Ive been here and had great service, Ive returned to have sub-par service (it wasnt very busy). All in all, if youre looking for a place to grab some cheap beers (were talking domestics on tap) before heading into The Clubhouse or heading to somewhere else to spend the night, stop in and check it out at least once."
5,"My favorite restaurant in AZ, No Contest!!! Awesome staff, delicious food and the best salsa!!!!"
4,"It really was the perfect place to start our night. I was with a group of girls out for a bachelorette party and someone in our group suggested Drift. Loved it! Its totally cute, and I love the touristy Hawaiian vibe its got going on. We had a few appetizers, a round of drinks, and a round of shots. The appetizers were simple and nothing spectacular. The drinks and shots were pretty good. Service was hit or miss. Our server was pretty attentive at the start but we had to hunt her down when we were done and ready to move on. Id love to come back to Drift for dinner, the menu looked pretty good and Id love to try another drink. If anything, Id like to return to stare at the womans bathroom again. Totally cool!"
3,"Ive had this groupon for Padres that had been burning a hole in my pocket for a long time! Finally as it neared expiration date I ventured into Phoenix to try it out. Its a cute little restaurant with a really cool red door! FYI - theres a check-in deal here! $.01 margarita! Mmhmm you saw that right! Certainly not the best I have had by any means but you cant really go wrong for that price right? After ordering our drinks we decided to splurge on an appetizer so we started out with the Queso Fundido. I was so excited about it because hey it should be all about the cheese and as a Wisconsin boy, Im all about it! Unfortunately it was more about the spinach and not so much about the queso - it tasted really good, just missing a lot of the main ingredient in my opinion... He ordered the Mexico City Fajitas! Really well cooked chicken, with the right amount of everything! Super good! I ordered the Pollo Rellano. The chicken (as in the previous dish) was really well cooked but was lacking on the stuffed part. So it was good - just nothing wow worthy. My dish came with side of guajillo mashed potatoes - which look like a pile of mashed sweet potatoes - I personally wasnt a huge fan of the taste but as usual Ill finish my plate anyway :) The service was pretty good, it was just a very laid back environment, which I wasnt really expecting for some reason. Im not dying to go back by any means but if someone wanted to try it out I would go again!"
2,"Pros: - Calm/Quiet atmosphere - Clean - Amenities are good *Hot tub outdoors and inside, large steam room & sauna.  Nice sitting areas both outside and inside.  - Products (Shampoo, conditioner & body wash were okay.) Cons: - EXPENSIVE! - Beware of the 20%gratuity (i dont know whos idea this was but, i was a little offended at the presumptive 20% tip. I tip well when deserved but i like tipping on my own terms.)  - Spa hostess at the front desk/checking in was snooty - 50 min massages I went in for Aji (swedish) 50 min massage, the massage therapist was personable and was attentive to what I asked her to focus on. I know the time limit was not her fault but 50 mins for a massage at these prices made me feel really ripped off.  (i had a Groupon to offset the ridiculous cost but even that didnt make me feel better about the cost.) I dont know who thinks a 50 min massage is enough.......but come on an extra 10 mins wouldnt kill them! All in all i would say skip it, its expensive and for less money you can get a 60 min or 90 min and feel great because you didnt over pay."
5,"4-5 locations.. all 4.5 star average.. I think Arizona really has some fantastic Pizza options, and Spinatos is at the top of my pizza fix list.. the semi sweet sauce is addictive, great service, fresh ingredients, The Spicy Italian is my favorite... The chocolate chips cookies are laced with mind altering drugs, that make your body parts""romantic"" when you think of their cookies.. BTW 5:30pm, on a Tuesday, when we left, a 30 minute wait.. Its on the List.."
5,"They dont serve food, they serve sex on a plate. At first glance the place looks like a hallway but its really a flavor factory hidden away between two buildings no one cares about because those places dont have Pastys. The service is fast , friendly, and the music is off the chain.  The food is not to be forgotten though, there are so many selections of Pasty variations that anyone with any craving will loose all control of there facial expressions. I only wish the place was bigger, there have been times when Ive  had to wait for a space to open up but thats not necessarily a bad thing.  That time allowed me  to prepare myself for the nirvana inducing flavorgasm that is The Cornish Pasty Company."
2,"Food was decent, not too sure how this place is getting such rave reviews though... Probably the most expensive Mexican place of its style. $25 for a burro, two tostadas, and two mini-tacos. Seriously?! Also, no free refills or chips/salsa. Are we going back? No."
1,"Slow service, staff needs more training. Theres like 4 managers and none of the know what they are doing, i dont think this place is going to make it. Sorry but you lost 4 very good patrons Saturday night because of your poor customer service"
5,"So yummy!! My favorite Mexican place!! Love the chips, salsa, and bean dip. The extra spicy green salsa is so good too. We are regulars here."
4,"Its difficult to find good bagels in Scottsdale, so my roommate and I ventured to Tempe to satiate our cravings. We both got the open-faced bagel, cream cheese and lox.  It was excellent and fresh.  The bagel was chewy without being too bread-like.  The lox was fresh and high quality.  I will definitely be back."
3,"This place was kinda cool. We first got there around 9:30 on a saturday night. The place was dead... but that is to be expected for a ""night club"". The drinks are expensive, but tasty. The decor is AMAZING. The couches are comfy and there is just enough seating space without it overtaking the joint. We ended up leaving after 1 drink and went back a few hours later and the place was busy busy busy. They had great music playing and the dance floor was full. One downfall was, I hate when you go to a bar and the bathroom has an attendant that you need to tip. They are holding everything that you need... soap and paper towels. I feel that I shouldnt feel forced to tip someone because I wanted to wash my hands after I used the bathroom. Overall the place was decent. I am new in town and I am sure that there are better places to have a drink. I will most likely go back (in the future), just not in a rush to."
3,"The food isnt all that. I order an Ahi Salad, which was barely touched. On the other hand, the chicken Popsicle my friends ordered were quite delightful. all in all, that atmosphere was surely enjoyable."
4,"We went out last night to the movies, and with an hour and a half to spare, we thought we had time to stop at this newish restaurant on the corner of Indian School and 24th St. It was a family owned place, baby in bassinet by the cashier, and absolutely no explanations of what the food is. Just strange names. We ordered and sat down. 35-40 minutes later, we realized the food still hadnt come and wed never make it out to Scottsdale for our movie. So, disappointed, we took the food when it finally came and brought it home and ordered something up on Amazon. When I dove into the ""to go"" boxes, I stopped complaining. Man, that food was delicious. I ordered the Chicken Tikka, only because I pretty much knew what it would be, and it far beat my expectations. Our Chicken Kabab (ordered again because we knew what it would be) was delicious as well. To the owners, thank you for being here. Well be back. Please develop something that describes the food, and make a non-egg version of the Naan bread please! Lots of vegans and allergies out there who dont expect food from  your region to have heavy eggs included. Readers, as long as you set your expectations correctly about time for food preparation, youll be very happy with Khyber Halal. Get in there and support this neighborhood gem!"
4,"We eat at My Thai about twice a month.  Sometimes we do carry out and other times we eat at the restaurant.  There is usually the same couple of waitstaff there.  And we are always treated very, very well.  We usually have a lot of food modifications as well....like no sugar, completely vegetarian with no oyster sauce, fish sauce, etc, and VERY spicy.  They always accommodate us and always get it right.  While this restaurant doesnt have anything specific for kids, they have a nice attitude towards kids and are friendly.  My 4 year old likes coming here and will often ask to go to My Thai. The only reason I dont give this restaurant a 5 star rating is because I wish they could do some local sourcing for the food and/or organic."
4,"We had a great first visit here for brunch.  They have a creative brunch menu with traditional breakfast items with a twist, lunch items, and great-sounding desserts.  Our party had the sunflower salad, bacon and eggs, steak and eggs, the hummus platter, and the sweet potato chips.  Everything was quite good and very fresh.  We really enjoyed the sweet potato chips - not greasy at all, just sweet potato flavor with a hint of seasoning.  Well be back to try some of the other menu items.   Great atmosphere and pretty small dining room which makes it quaint and cozy.  Unfortunately we had the table right next to the kitchen doors which was the only unpleasant part.  Bussers and waiters would come flying out of the kitchen and then stand inches away from me with load trays of food trying to figure out what table they were going to.  The water refiller seemed especially hungover as he literally stood next to my arm for 3 minutes trying to figure out who needed water.  They should put a divider between that table and the kitchen.  Also bar service was slow - 15 minute wait for 2 mimosas.  Waiter apologized but still... overall a good experience.  Big fan of the atmosphere and menu.  Can step up the service a bit."
3,"Anything with the word ""Original"" in that name always makes me wonder, for real?  This place is for real. It is very close to the new house and I met the rents there for a burger the other night and to watch the Giants beat the 9ers. I immediately felt a sense of familiarity when I walked in the door, I hadnt remembered being there before until I walked in. But it all came back to me very quickly. I remember stopping by here years ago with friend before heading to the Fair one year. It was just as good as I remember it.  It is an old fashioned burger join. You can either walk up and order then take your food to your table, or if you are on the bar side you can order from the bartender, who is very attentive, even with a full bar and restaurant. Once you get your burger or sandwich, you go to the fixins bar, load up on toppings and veggies then sit back down to enjoy! They also have some great sides and aps, fried mushrooms, onion rings, zucchini and fries. They fries are OK, a little over done for my taste but everything else was great.  This is a great place to make a regular stop on your weekly happy hour agenda, to watch a sports game (tons of TVs on the bar side) or to fix your burger cravings."
1,35 minutes... No food. You be the judge.
3,"My niece want to go here for her birthday, on a Friday night.  The wait was about 30 min.   The onion blossom was not as crispy as I remember but still pretty good. Its horseradish sauce was stronger than I expected.  I had to ask for a side of ketchup.   My steak was cooked as ordered (medium rare) but lacked taste somehow; the lobster tail was grilled right.  The steak of my niece was on the dry side (overcooked). My daughters steak was as she liked it (medium rare). For dessert, we shared a gigantic scoop of ice cream and whipped cream and an Oreo waffle with more ice cream and whipped cream.  We couldnt finish. The service was good. Our waitress was very friendly."
4,Chicken noodle in a bread bowl.  Sandwiches are good too :)
5,"To say this place is super rad would be an understatement!!  We for las noches de las luminarias.  And I wish we couldve stayed longer, also seeing the gardens during the daylight is added to the to do list!   Having never been there the staff was super helpful in guiding us, not to mention really friendly!  The music was entertaining and a good variety.  They also have a synthetic ice rink and youre allowed up to 15 minutes of skating, if youre not shy!  The buffet they offered was a joke and I dont recommend doing it.  For 16.50, youre only allowed one trip through and other such silly stipulations... no thanks.    Other than that, what a great place to go!"
3,"Youre in 120 degree Scottsdale weather and you need a casual change of clothes, a bite to eat, and a refreshing adult beverage; Tommy Bahama can do it all under one roof. A retail clothier on the bottom floor and a decent, predictable place to eat and drink upstairs...ok, Ill work with you Tommy. There is nothing special about this place except I found their service in both their retail space and restaurant superb. Try their grilled crab cakes and their twice shaken martini."
5,"I love this place the more I go to it! The service is completely out of the ordinary for fast food and now they have something called, Mexican Gumbo. Holy schneikies its good!!! Cant beat the prices either! If I had a choice of this place over Chipotle, I would choose Qdoba ANY day!!!"
4,"*cut to scene* Friday night, lounging around discussing the lameness of the evening, ready to indulge in a new adventure. six pack of Newcastle sits untouched in fridge and bellys aching for fulfillment. yelp.com search reveals a local japanese eatery nearby.  enter, Hana. first off, pre-game excitement for this BYOB, local, fresh sushi spot. Newcastle in hand, my friend and I strutted in here at around 8pm on a mildly warm Friday night. the place is jammed, and a couple parties stand around waiting for tables. great, a long wait. nope, two seats open at the bar. sat down, and our beer was immediately taken and put in a fridge to ensure it wouldnt lose any of its remarkably smooth quality.  first beer is poured, and the excitement ensues. friendly and welcoming server devluges us in the specials, and unfortunately they were out of most of their fish as they have been for three weeks. toro and salmon were our options, so we went with a special for the night, the spider roll, and the vegas roll. also, edamame to start. the food was superb. the edamame came spicy with a side of chili flakes and siracha for our never ending quest to burn the shit out of our mouths. a second round of newcastle was brought upon when our first was finished, and the sushi came shortly thereafter, looking like little pieces of art. both sets of rolls were enormous and came about 6 to a plate. the vegas roll was packed with cream cheese, avocado, and salmon. the special roll, the spider roll, was full of crispy soft shell crab and just enough spicy-ness for a much needed kick in the mouth. one dip in my wasabi/soy sauce concoction was more than enough. our third and final beer was poured by an overly-anxious and over-stimulated, presumably newbie, bus boy. I had about 4 inches of head on my beer and my friend got hers spilled and nearly twice as much head.  he excellent waitress we had made up for this guys slips during the meal. the staff wished us a nice farewell on our way out, and I felt as though I had just left a very close friends house.  I will definitely be back with more six packs and good friends to share this little diamond in the rough with."
4,"Upper Crust is like Grimaldis on steroids. The two places have nearly identical decor and the pizza is extremely similar. Upper Crust uses a little more cheese which is nice, but they also use cornmeal on the crust which I am not crazy about. The wings are huge and delicious, especially with the honey BBQ sauce. The meatballs are nothing special (with or without the mozzarella cheese), but Stephanie H would disagree. Happy hour is Monday-Friday 4pm to 7pm and on Wednesdays they offer half off on bottles of wine.  Overall, it is a very good pizza and I plan on returning. Next time Ill be giving that pizza cookie a try. I really liked Upper Crust, but Grimaldis in Old Town is still my favorite for traditional NY style thin crust pizza."
1,"I went here while on vacation visiting my friend. Neither of us had been there before, but I know they have lots of locations on the west coast, so we gave it a try.  The staff was totally rude. Before we went, we called to check the hours. The guy on the phone was patronizing and acted inconvenienced to have to give any information.  The pizza was blah - totally generic and nothing special. If youre going to have mediocre food, you better have exceptional service. Double fail."
1,"For frozen yogurt quality, I give this place a one. Honestly, its small, theres very little variety in terms of toppings, and the yogurt tastes cheap... Probably because its a big franchise. There is a reason why youre paying less for an ounce... Truly - you get what you pay for.  The concept is neat, sure, but if youre looking for pizzazz then you should try Yogurtini... Its just up the road from Yogurtland. Anyway, the single star says it all... ""Eek! Methinks not."""
5,"Andrea has been a lifesaver- literally! She was watching over our furry monsters when our AC went out  in July and we were across the country. She not only made an extra visit just to see if the AC was broken, but helped us find an open kennel to get our cats boarded. Shes been our creature sitter several times now, thankfully with less craziness. Her rates are very reasonable and she keeps in great contact with you. Her initial visit with us went over all the little things we wanted done (like picking up the paper and bringing it in) and was very thorough. Since she offers a full house sitter and pet sitter menu of services, shes knows things to cover that we had not thought of! Shes very professional and is licensed and insured.  Your animals will thank you!"
5,"This was the marriage of two of my favorite things alcohol and ice cream.  As Charlie Sheen would say ""Winning!!!!"" I had a groupon so Laura A. and I went to try out this amazing place.  The groupon got us each two scoops so we went with 4 different so we could sample the most possible.  I got the Apple Pie / Spiced Rum and Black Raspberry / Chambord Liqueur.  Both were awesome I actually enjoyed the Chambord the most but I was in ice cream heaven.   Laura got the Mimosa with Champagne and the Margarita / Tequila.  I really enjoyed both of hers the margarita was a strawberry one which is my fav.  The Mimosa was very refreshing and I could imagine that being a great hangover remedy at about 11am on a Saturday =) just sayin.   I have found a new place to cure my sweet cravings and cant wait to try more flavors as the website has many more I didnt see in store so I assume they are on rotation which is great.   I hope that eventually I can find a pinapple upside down cake with rum flavor"
4,Pasand is under new ownership and the changes already seem good. I went there today expecting the same old stuff. What I got was some truely excellent tasting food. The food was leaps and bounds above the previous food. The spices were much more distinct and flavorful and especially fresh. In talking with the owners they were going to rennovate the run downinside and add some more buffet places. Overall I approve of what has been down to the place especially the food.
5,Found the Tuck Shop on my Urban Spoon AP and what a grand surprise it ended up being!   In the heart of Coronado this little house has been transformed to a true Phoenix jewel! The food was amazing..we had pork with a pasta and broccoli.  The pork had two amazing sauces that my boyfriend I argued over which was the better.  The pasta was okay a bit of a cumin flavor but great once we mixed it with the porks sauce.  The broccoli was a great fresh touch.   The manager came over and spent some time talking to us more about the menu and plans to open another place with a different menu soon.  A must try if you are a down town kinda person!   The crowd  was a mix of tshirts casual to formal and the patrons ages ranged just as much.  The menu changes with the season so go check it out!  Only complaint Ive heard from people Ive recommended was the lack of choice if you are a vegetarian.
4,"I didnt really ""get it"". I was expecting more Island style food, or more adventurous treats. *  Bar was great. *  Tuna Poke thing was fantastic. *  Cajun burger was terrific, but the bun was too dense and troublesome. *  Chicken CocoaJoe was a bust.  Chicken a little dry and under-seasoned, rice and beans were bland (needs a giant ham-hock and about 3 more days).  The Plaintain was overflavored, but underseasoned (they dont neem much more than salt and time). Awesome location. Menu will expand I am sure. Repaint the bathroom please."
4,"not a bad place for pizza... it is very infomral and the pizza is good... they have a nice beer selection... if you want to get a pie, beer and salad in Old Town and that is all you really want this is the place... the menu is baiscally pizza, beer and salad... but all good..."
5,They get 5 stars for the only thing I have ever had there. Every single time I have to get the Pizza Nortena. It is out of this world. It is meant to be an appetizer but we get it to go and have it for dinner.
4,"Ive been to almost all of the dog parks in the East Valley and this is definitely one of the best. I drive 5 miles each way daily to go there.  It is by far the largest in Tempe (which is easy because the others are tiny).  It is large enough to accommodate a lot of dogs and people (which there are at peak times), has lots of grass, 2 doggy water fountains so they dont have to drink out of community bowls, trees around the perimeter and a ramada with tables/benches, and other benches located around the perimeter. It is open early in the morning and late at night (there are lights on until 10 PM). There are also city supplied poop bags in dispensers which are usually stocked (although occasionally not, so bringing a bag doesnt hurt).   The people are pretty friendly and the poop  situation (people that dont clean it up) isnt that bad in comparison with many other parks, especially Cosmo and Chaparral. There is only one large section (no small or inactive section), but it seems to work out OK as the dogs arent overly rowdy or aggressive in general. Ive never seen a real fight. There is a sort of walking path around the entire perimeter and many do walk it for exercise.  Overall, a well above average place to take your dog.   LOCATION:  Its a little hard to find.  Take Kyrene to Carver (halfway between Warner and Elliot).  West on Carver about 2 blocks on the left.  There are other routes, but this is the easiest, unless youre coming from  west of the park. Anyone is welcome  to contact me for my opinions on the other dog parks in the East Valley."
2,"Ive been a CVS guy for about 15 years, spanning three cities across the country. Some branches are better than others, some regions are better than others - theyre no better or worse than other national chains which also have some good branches and some bad branches. I picked them because they have a great ""rewards program"" and because they have heavy presences in places where I travel often. So this is a bad branch. Theres a couple decent check-out kids, but in general their employees are among the worst trained Ive ever seen, in terms of providing polite, timely, friendly customer service. They avoid your eyes when they see you looking for something in an aisle, lest you bother them with a question. They never EVER greet you with a smile and a ""good morning"" or a ""did you find everything you need?"" while you check out. They have inconsistent policies about whether or not coupons can be scanned from iPhone or paper copies needed (the manager basically called me a liar when I said checkout people have scanned my iPhone coupons many times in the past). I guess if you sell very profitable liquor and meds, you make money no matter how bad your attitude is. Its not like Walgreens and Rite Aid are setting the world on fire with their customer service either.... If you dont travel a lot like I do, pick a nice local independent pharmacist..."
2,"I have mixed feeling about the W Scottsdale. During the day the pool area is poorly run, but in the evenings the pool turns into a pretty fun nightlife spot.   Daytime: The pool is always jam packed with a fairly disgusting crowd and the dudes out number the babes by a 3 to 1 count Id say. Thats no fun. Oh, and by dudes, I mean douche bags. And Babes? More like gross skanks covered in makeup at the pool. Ok, I guess Im being a hater, but spend a few hours here and you might be kind of disgusted with the scene too. Its just really amateur hour here with the piss poor service and their bad attitudes and obnoxious patrons. The only reason I came was because a friend likes to stay at the W when visiting and he too noted the quality of this place has declined over the years. He has stayed at four different W locations (NY, South Beach, Westwood) and said this one is the ""worst and trashiest"". It took an hour before any waitress came over to ask if we wanted any drinks or food. When started to get service it was always a long wait for our pitcher of margaritas or buckets of beer and food. Speaking of the food, the fries, fish tacos and club sandwich are all great. The grilled cheese, not so much. The first $42 pitcher of margaritas was weak, hardly tasting any alcohol. The second pitcher was stronger. To be fair, the Saturday service was much better. Nighttime: Much improved scene, but still not great. There are a lot of out-of-towners since it is a hotel, but still plenty of locals too. I think its a good mixture. Pants and collared shirts are required, so that usually gets rid of most of the tank top, neck tat wannabes from earlier in the day at the pool.  But really, you are just trading one group of wannabes for another. Man, Im a hater huh? Oh well, you can handle it. Drinks are overpriced, but this is the W. Be ready to spend lots o cash. Rooms: Ive been in a few rooms at this hotel. Each have been nice and clean, but pretty small."
4,"6 inch tuna on white bread, with everything including spinach, but NO pickles. Not even joking, this THE only subway that ever gets my sandwich right. Thank you for the $5 meal deal, it beats the other chains in this shopping plaza as far as price for lunch."
2,"I had been wanting to try Sals for quite a while but never got around to it.  Until today!  I got a side salad and the 14"" Sals Favorite.  I must say, not impressed at all.  The salad was made of what looked like a bag of pre-shredded lettuce.  And not very fresh either.  The pizza was just ok, Ive had much better.  Very sad and disappointed, unfortunately I will not be going back to Sals."
1,"food is ok, but service is very slow!"
3,"Its true, there is a real bull and a slide. This place has been around forever, I think my parents used to go there back in the 70s.  I cant say much about the food since Ive only been here for happy hour, which was pretty decent. Their HH  included top shelf for 3 bucks and some cheap beers. They also have appetizers on the HH menu, sliders, quesadillas and potato skins, that sort of stuff. Pretty nice view and going during happy hour you can see all the people sitting in traffic on the 10 and cheers them from the balcony."
1,"Cool place but dont try to arrange a special event. The proprietor was arragont, unflexible and unethical when I held my friends bachelorette party at The Duce. Be warned!"
3,Great to see a Total Wine closer to where I live.  Large selection and decent prices. Used the $10 off coupon from the newspaper to buy a nice Napa Cab this afternoon.
4,This place has consistently good food on EVERY visit. Lots of choices and really fast service! Lucky to have this so close to work. Check the soup and sandwich combo. Salad bar rocks too.
4,"Ive only ever had the carne asada quesadilla and churros, but they are damn good."
4,"Sometimes I think my love for Mongolian BBQ is TOO much. I could eat at places like Genghis Grill or YCs multiple times a week and never get sick of it. Hell, I wont go to chinese buffets if they dont offer Mongolian BBQ. It has to be one of my favorite foods. That is why when I moved to North Phoenix, it was a hard adjustment with there being none of the marquee Mongolian BBQ chains being up here. Then I found Stir Fry Paradise via Yelp. My girlfriend and I went to Stir Fry Paradise on a Saturday after lunch hour. When we went in the manager(or owner, not sure) greeted us and made sure we had been to a Mongolian BBQ place before so we would know what to do. While we were selecting our food, she even made sure to help us with a sauce selection and let us know what combos work best. After that, she ended up cooking our food as well. She was really outgoing and helpful. The food selection was pretty standard for a Mongolian BBQ place. Chicken, pork, beef, and turkey. You could pay extra for shrimp. They had a decent variety of veggies, but all I ever go for is pineapple. They offer three kinds of noodles for your meal and nine sauce varieties. In addition to the stir fry choices, they have a small sidebar of regular chinese buffet items. Normally when a place like this has this side offer, they are pretty bad and not edible. At Stir Fry Paradise, this is the opposite. My girlfriend and I both enjoyed a few items from the side bar.  Overall, I would say check our Stir Fry Paradise if youre in the neighborhood and want some Mongolian BBQ. Good prices and great service make this a great local eatery."
5,"Wait a second...I have not written a review!  This is nuts!!!!! Anyways...I adore this place.  LGO and the pizzeria are my favorite places in the world...lol...I am here at least 4-6 times per week.  It is nuts!  Anyways..the reason I am here all the time is because it is FABULOUS!!!!  This place can never go wrong!  The orange and fennel salad it amazing!  It is the perfect mix and each bite and a delight in your mouth and to your taste buds!  I often get this salad through out the week.  I love the kale and quinoa salad too!  It is my go to salad.  I am obsessed with the avocado pizza with prosciutto and goat cheese and the roasted corn pizza with prosciutto.  I wish I could get enough but I cannot!  The ambiance is awesome! Mr.Lynn is a genius and made this place so welcoming and open.  I love how its so laid back and romantic at the same time.  The parking is difficult, but you expect that since it is so popular!  Now the Peanut Butter Pie!!!  OMG OMG OMG!!  There are no words...it is DELICIOUS!!  I try to refuse every time but I cannot.  I really enjoy the sangria.  The wine selection is great!  I just love this place!!!!"
4,"I have to admit that I find myself thinking that I like mine tall dark and Russian.   Its nice to have a coffee shop near by thats not Starbucks, has good coffee and reasonable prices.  So far I just stick with the house brew (which is smooth and not too bitter yet not too sweet) since the fancy coffee drinks usually have many calories that I do not need!  I have tried the blueberry muffin-quite yummy as well as the chocolate chip cookies- delicious.  The cafe is attached to The Great Indoors so you can people watch, browse thru design books or take a leisurely stroll through the design center.  Its a great way to unwind or perk up on your choice of caffeinated beverage."
5,"If youve read some of my other reviews youll see a trend.  Kohls Department Stores.....Brewers spring training......  Yep, Im a cheesehead. (But if you EVER actually catch me wearing a hunk of fake foam cheese on my head, shoot me. Really.)  What can I say? I like Culvers. It reminds me of home. Its total comfort food.  Got one of their Wisconsin Swiss melts. What other fast food joints offer burgers with Swiss on rye? The crinkle cut fries are always hot and fresh. And tasty.  Culvers is known for their frozen custard. What Wisconsinite has not driven past a Culvers, looked at their sign, checked out the flavor of the day, and gone, ""Hey, that sounds good!!"", and quickly pulled into the parking lot?  If youre from Wisconsin or the Midwest stop in for a Butterburger and some custard....it will bring back lots of good memories.  Like another reviewer noted when he said he felt like he was in Iowa or something.....well.....thats the whole charm behind Culvers. You DO feel like youre in Wisconsin or one of the upper Midwest states.  Granted Im not the best person to review Culvers....Im a little biased towards it. But if you want a different kind of fast food experience and youve never been to the upper Midwest, its a heck of a whole lot cheaper than flying there.  Give it a chance....see if you like it."
5,"I was initially going to give Rivas 3-stars, as theyre really just like any other Filibertos/Umbertos/Robertos/Ernie and Bertos out there, except for a couple of small differences. For one, everything seems to be just a little bit more fresh there.  Its probably not, but it tastes like it.  And secondly, their little salsa bar is killer because their green salsa has plenty of flavor and they always have fresh pico de gallo out there, a must for any burrito. The California Burrito, with carne asada, potatoes, pico de gallo and cheese, is a must, as is the standard Carne Asada Burrito.  But the real winner here is the Carne Asada Fries.  A metric ton of carne asada piled on top of freshly fried french fries, sour cream, cheese and guacamole for only $5?  Cant be beat, especially if youre hammered and its 3 A.M.  Not a classy joint, not a place you go if youre wary of stupid crap like ""health code violations"" (the best places never are), but definitely a late-night hot-spot for the Mill crowd.  Lovely. And its not for sissies that dont like ham in their beans either, damnit."
4,The pizza was crisp and delicious. The place is super casual and very comfortable. The staff is down-to-earth and friendly. I loved the live music from Tom Mein on the patio. It felt great to be able to sit on the patio and enjoy a downtown Phoenix sunset in the spring. Having beer and wine for sale was nice as well. I will be back to try more of the menu.
4,"I am so glad I found this nursery! Not only is it a beautiful place but the employees are unbelievable, so helpful and knowledgeable.  Needed to get my garden ready for planting and they helped with everything. The plants they have look great, not all wilted like some other places.  Think this has become one of my weekend stops."
3,"Wowza!  This place is a total trip!  No, I dont smoke, but if I did this place is probably the place I would go to.   First off, the food was okay.  I ordered some chicken wings, which wasnt really that great.  My favorite was the Thai Curry -- it definitely had some pop to it.  Its one of those that creep up on you.  Milk please!  My friend ordered some Sake that I thought was real good and smooth -- dont ask me what it was, the lighting was low and I didnt care much by the time I arrived. Service was pretty good I guess, and then again the place was drop dead for a Friday night.  Whats up with that!?  Im sure the place gets hopping on 1st Friday, but thats only one day out of the month -- I sure it picks up quick! Ambience, was cool, just reminded me of the 70s in a way even though I didnt grow up during the 70s haha, but I thought the design and decor were pretty cool.  Eccentric I think was the word I used.  Bathroom was blue and thats all Ill say.......check it out! - Enjoy!"
5,"INCREDIBLE food, relaxed/great atmosphere, perfect to bring kids/family...the cheeseburger, shredded bbq pork sandwich, sweet potatoes- too die for! Must try! Worth the drive!"
5,"I love the other locations of Thai Rama and this one is no exception! Food is fast, fresh tasting and well seasoned. The lunch specials are unique and delicious, and the service is good. Far superior to the Chars Thai restaurant that used to be in the same location."
2,"So the place has Christmas lights, and a fair amount of ambiance, and supposedly theres a shirtless shot at 1:00 - which might make going back worth it.  Other than that, the service was less than lackluster, the domestic kegs all seemed flat.  In other words, go somewhere else unless its 1:00 and you want to see some daytime nudity."
5,"Im so sad I didnt discover the Herb Box sooner. I went for a girls lunch and was blown away - by the decor, the vibe, the view and the food - and this was during the winter. I cant wait for patio weather because this will become a weekend go-to spot for me. The salads and sandwiches are delicious and the fries and chips - holy moly! Theyre amazing and youll get tons of them. The decor is perfectly shabby chic with a traditional twist and I could seriously move in.  If you and your mom and girlfriends love the quaint feel of Arcadia Farms, give Herb Box a whirl. Its got the same feel, but more modern. Love love love it."
5,"This review has been waiting and waiting for me to get it out there, so here goes... Baiz market reminds me of Chicago. There are so many great Middle Eastern markets back there that I felt spoiled when I came to Phoenix and didnt know of many. If you think of Lee Lee as the goto spot for all of your Asian cooking needs, then Baiz is the place to go to for all of your Middle Eastern cooking needs. And, with Al Hana (check out my review for that too) right inside to satiate your hunger, Baiz is numero uno in my book!  This place is fantastic, the food is fantastic, the prices are fantastic and being able to grab all the ingredients I need to make homemade baba ganoush while snacking on an amazing kufta sandwich, is pretty okay too! =)"
4,"Great location, great food, and nice ambiance.  The menu isnt huge, but this is a nice French cafe type setting if thats what youre into."
4,"I love SAIL INN! Getting past the $8-10 cover on weekends is the hard part, but usually Sail delivers, 1) AMAZING LOCAL BANDS, 2) Laid back hippie, hipster,arty, folk vibe 2) cheap drinks, LOVE the little pitchers of beer - budlite for $4.25 on certain nights. Phoenix has a pretty lame music scene, but at least at Sail Inn you can always find decent live music and a fun crowd."
4,"This place is all about the seafood.  Dont roll up to the Fish Market expecting a cool place to hang or a hip crowd.  No problem on the crowd...lots of folks in a pretty basic seafood restaurant, chowing on the best seafood Ive had in the valley so far.  The hip is not here.  Not until I showed up with my wife Audrey W to meet Kevin H and Marian H.  You could actually see the coolness spread around the restaurant when we walked in...a subtle ripple, sort of like a gentle wave at a spring training game. So I arrived in Phoenix from Boston and have high standards for seafood.  I had been craving fish & chips for awhile and decided to give Fish Market a try.  I got a combo-fish, scallops and prawns.  The batter was light and not very oily...+1.  The prawns were very tender and done to perfection..+1.  The scallops were tender, sweet and juicy...+1.  The fish was done just right as well although it was not the haddock or even cod I am accustomed to in Boston. Everyone else was pleased with their food as well.  I will be trying other seafood places in the valley but Ill keep Fish Market in mind as a standby."
4,"Delicious burger! They have a massive menu with something for everyone.  My gf got a light basil-pesto chicken with a nicely sweet bread, while I got a southwestern burger and fruit on the side.  This is a gem in ahwatukee.  Walking in, I felt at home because it reminded me of many cafes from Boston; it was clean but with a bit of hip grunge look.  Theres a big garage door on the one side of the restaurant that opens out for a large patio in the cooler months. Ill definitely return here when I make trips to ahwatukee."
5,"i have 2 words for you: passive. active. dividing the dog park into sections based on tempermant isnt smart, its fn brilliant.  2 gates upon entrance and exit safe it up so i have no worries that my shelter dog will hit the streets again.  this dog park is clean, the people are friendly and so are the dogs. finally, a place where we can all get along."
4,"I cant believe I didnt write a review of Metro after my first visit but I got a second chance last Saturday night with Dottsy Z, Andrea K and company.  We had a reservation for 8PM for 4 of us, and at 730PM Andrea asked us to add 2 guests and when Dottsy called Metro they said of course, but please be advised you may have a little wait for the larger table. Which leads me to the only bad point of the evening: We had to wait ONE AND A HALF HOURS for our larger table. We had all expected and accepted a 30 minute wait. After about 40 we went to the bar to get some wine and oysters (otter creeks = yummmm).  After an hour had passed and no one had come to address the situation with our group, I approached the hostess and she was very apologetic and offered to comp our bar tab, which was incredibly nice.  When we were finally seated our server was friendly and attentive and had gorgeous blue eyes. Hello!  We were all starving and got right to the point with our orders: I started with the cucumber soup and no amount of yums or mmmmms can fully describe the delight that was set before me. A cold soup, this is made with cucumbers, buttermilk, dill and olive oil, with chunks of lump crabmeat and a dollop of caviar thrown on top, because why the hell not?!  Also, the soup came in a really large bowl and I was full by the time I finished it. I did soldier on to my main course which was the Moules Frites which is what I had the first time I came here and is a truly inspired dish with juicy fresh mussels, and a broth with thyme, garlic and perhaps a little white wine. Then to add insult to injury they serve the huge casoulet with a hearty portion of herbed french fries that were the perfect crispness and didnt leave oil on my hands.  Sadly I had to leave some of those friends behind, but only because it was time for dessert! I chose pot de creme which is normally topped with brioche. I requested a brioche-free pot and it was no problem. I was served a tiny ramekin of creamy custard topped with a sort of peanut butter syrup/creme and three slices of caramelized banana. It was really yummy though within 10 minutes my heart was racing from all the sugar.  I will point out that this dinner took 2 full hours (we left at 11:30PM) making this the longest I ever spent in a restaurant (3.5 hours are you kidding me?) which is why I ultimately docked one star. Based on food alone Metro Brasserie deserves 10 stars."
4,"OPEN for business!!  Its located in the Canyon Trails Towne Center along the main entrance with the 2 banks.   Casual, cheap, yet decent quality sushi and Japanese entrees.  New and clean.  Excellent service.  Grand Opening special:  one FREE appetizer if you spend more than $10.   Decent spicy salmon and salmon avocado rolls.  Very crunchy shrimp tempura.  Excellent dressing with the included salad.  Miso soup was a bit bland.  They need to add a little more miso to the broth.  Lunch specials include any bento boxe for $8.25 and pick 2 rolls for $7.45 that includes miso soup and salad. Hmmm, Im not quite sure whether its Ah-Kai Sushi & Grill or Ah-Hai Sushi & Grill.  Public records show Ah-Kai but the menu says Ah-Hai."
4,"Food was good, service was great! If I didnt eat at Chilis so much inn the past, I would definitely go back, but since coming back to the US, many more other restaurants to try....."
4,"Im giving 4 stars because I just love to find this many artifacts of the basket and clay varieties when I visit a museum. It really amazes me, the craftmanship of our ancient peoples! This small museum is not part of the Science Museum circuit, so I wasnt able to use my discount or member card, but for $6 I felt it was worth the trip to check it out. Some exhibits in the kids room have been duplicated and enhanced in the main museum hall, which was fun to compare. The outdoor area is actually a preserved portion of a reservation belonging to the Hohokum Indians and there are examples of the water distribution canals and housing styles from 300 years ago along the Salt River, AZ. Great, informative afternoon!"
4,"I had the chicken teriyaki bowl (with extra veggies and easy on the brown rice) and it was a nice lunch.  Nice alternative to fast food, although those sauces dont exactly make it healthy."
4,"I discovered Taka Grill and Cafe while driving north from work on Central in search of somewhere different to have lunch. No line, no waiting. We ordered, sat down and our food was served with 5 minutes. We were out of there in 40 minutes, which is perfect when you only have an hour for lunch.. I wanted sushi so I ordered the Shrimp tempura roll with deep fried shrimp, imitation crab meat, avocado and cucumber for $6.95. Of course I would have preferred fresh crab meat, but was ok with the imitation. I liked the meal presentation. Food is served on large rectangular plates.  My coworkers also enjoyed their meals, except one said the salmon was frozen and thawed. We work within a mile of Taka and will be back again to try something different. (A mango smoothie sounds delicious right about now!)"
5,"I remember when this was Frys...back in the 70s. I think its great when these older buildings are put to good use instead of being torn down for another new strip mall. What a perfect place for an Antique Mall. This is a store that you could spend hours and hours really looking at everything. This Antique Mall has TONS of GREAT Antique finds...like REAL antique and retro STUFF, not recent overpriced crap that most Antique Dealers throw in their booth and try to pass off as something worth a lot of money. There are things here that I havent ever seen at other Antique stores before. I quickly walked down the aisles, the prices seemed pretty good and yet some that seemed OVERPRICED. I wonder if Antique Dealers are wanting to sell merchandise or pay monthly rent to store their museum. Believe it or not, you can still get BETTER deals on ebay. Several of the booths seemed like they had a theme, like stepping back into that time era... they were merchandised nicely. The restroom even looked like some grandmothers tacky bathroom decor, it really fit in well with the antique feeling. I will definitely come back here when I have more time to shop. ."
2,"Ive been to multiple Buca di Beppo locations in several cities.  They are a good place to go with a large group.  We went to this location with a group of nine.  The menu was typical.  We ordered the seafood trio, which was nice, and the fried mozzarella, which was also good.  The Caesars salad was also good.  We ordered pasta entrees and chicken, all of which were served up warm and in plentiful portions.  We left with a fair amount of food.  I would give the food four stars.  However, I would give the service one star.  Two in our party ordered cocktails.  Five of us ordered wine with dinner.  All drinks arrived together with our entrees.  We did not get enough dinner plates.  We did not get enough wine glasses, and had to wait for three more.  Three entrees arrived together, and we had to wait about five minutes for the fourth to arrive.  We had to ask three times for boxes to put our leftovers in.  We were never asked if we wanted dessert.  If the service were spot on, the rating would be much higher, but, I cant justify it."
2,"I got a quick to go Asian Salad.  Read the ingredients, no bell peppers (im allergic.)  Awesome.  Run like Oj to terminal B to catch my connecting and sit down to eat.  There were at least 15 slices of red bell pepper that i had to pick out.  This usually does the trick.  I guess since it was packaged, it tainted the rest of the salad.  Yep.  Instant allergic reaction.  Would not have wanted to sit next to me on the plane. It was tasty fresh and fast.  Please check your labels, Blanco.  Spare me and others that might be allergic to unlisted ingredients."
3,Great dive bar. Great jukebox
4,"I couldnt find anything to add to the previous review except I have never had a bad experience here no matter who did my nails. They are reasonably priced, friendly and one of the few nail salons I have been to that seem genuinely interested in the customer returning. The owners are friendly and the selection of acrylic colors offered is excellent. If your a magazine reader you might want to bring your own as they only have people and entertainment mags, however Ive only had to wait once in nearly a year."
4,"I was just thinking how long its been since Ive been to trivia on Tuesday nights and it made me sad.  I definitely need to get back into my trivia groove! Other than missing trivia, Im seriously craving some Jamaican Jerk Wings.  YUM!!  Not to mention the delicious guac that theyll make at your table if its not too busy.   Great bar, one of my faves.  Great servers/bartenders and fun, come-as-you-are atmosphere.  Not a typical Tempe bar which is quite refreshing."
4,"What can I say...the food and drinks were delicious and the atmosphere is sexy yet comfortable.  But the real stars of the show where the staff!  Everyone was exceptional, funny and charming: a dashing maitred, a handsome and truly helpful waiter, the chef was warm and happy to explain their signature Chinese oven even though Im sure he has to do that a thousand times a night and the support staff...wonderful.  The water ninja is not to be missed...this guy sneaks in and fills your glass with such speed and accuracy that water tension alone keeps the glass just slightly more than 100% full.  This guy amazed us with his serving mastery again and again while his plate clearing partner in crime delighted us with a quick coin trick.  Wonderful!"
4,"The Paseo Trail travels through Chandler along the Consolidated Canal.  It runs mostly N-S, connecting to other trails along the canal in Mesa and Gilbert, totaling around 18 miles. The trail is mostly paved on the east side of the canal and pea gravel hard pack on the west side.  It runs along subdivisions, golf courses and even a couple farms.  The grade is very gentle throughout.  I would consider the trail primarily for use by joggers, bicyclists and equestrians. There is parking at the address listed for the trail and nearby parking at Tumbleweed Recreation Center at McQueen and Germann.  There is also easy to find street parking near many of the junctions with major streets.  A good southern starting point is off of Riggs Rd. between Arizona and McQueen.  There is plenty of street parking.  From here the ride north is mostly a slight uphill ride, making the return trip a nice relaxing roll. One issue with the trail is crossings with major streets.  Most are not marked for motorists as trail crossings and there is no crosswalk so you may be faced with a relatively long wait to get a break in traffic or forcing the issue and forging ahead with care."
1,"Water park is OK.  However, the parking lot has ZERO security.  No security patrols, no cameras.  My catalytic converters were stolen off my truck in the parking lot at Big Surf Tempe today.  Sawed right off in broad daylight.  According to the cops, car break ins and catalytic converter thefts happen frequently here.  BEWARE!  The water park management doesnt give a shit.  Even the cop laughs because they always say the same thing:  ""Our camera is broken but its getting fixed next week"".  What a joke.  If you go, have someone drop you off.  Youve been warned!"
4,"I love minimalism.  If you can class up a place with a less-is-more approach, then youve exceeded the abilities of 95% of the American population.  Fortunately for the Cen Pholks Lisa G has this aptitude that transcends through her decor and into her simplistic, but delicious organic food. Now, heres my deal: you put prosciutto on your menu and and Im gonna get b-boy on your hardwood floors like Ozone in Breakin 2.  Lisa Gs breakbeats the hell out of their prosciutto sandwich with caramelized onions, parm cheese, fig jam, and arugula on an Italian loaf.  A side of balls and their Alamos Ridge Malbec and Im fresh. Service?  Never had a bad experience, but who cares?  The food outshines any flaws of a young dine-in."
3,"I see one word come up again and again in the reviews for this place: ""Cute"". Well, it is cute. The lighting and furniture and concept are happy, kind and appealing in an innocent way. The patio is cute, too. And its not Applebees. Oftentimes Ill be with a group of people trying to decide where to eat and drink. Someone will say ""Applebees at Central and Camelback"". There will be groans. Then someone will think of Maizies across the street and the response is ""well, its not Applebees"". Then we go there. Aside from that, ummm . . . well . . . . ."
5,"Why would I go to a restaurant and hope for the worst?  Because Im a snob and as a snob I was convinced that The Capital Grille would fall short of my extremely high expectations.  Not so. Bread basket: Outstanding onion bread, a pumpernickel/golden raisin bread, and some crisp cracker bread.  Nice all around. Extensive wines by the bottle with some great values to be had.  I did not check by the glass.  Our wine was decanted artfully at our table and the staff had a ready knowledge of the vineyard and year we had selected. Husband had: Oysters -  Blue point tonight, small this time of year so no big surprise there, well prepared and delicious. Lamb chop - Perfectly flavored and cooked, Frenched, the definition of how to prepare and cook a lamb chop perfectly. Potato Au Gratin - Typical steakhouse Au gratin.  Excellent flavor, huge portion, guaranteed to please a crowd (or anyone that loves a delicious cheesy crusted potato). I had: Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarella - You cant imagine how good this is....a lovely thin slice of prosciutto cooked to crisp perfection wrapped around a fresh piece of mozzarella cheese, with just the right amount of melt but not escaping the prosciutto shell.  A parmesan toast and tomato salad round this out.  You might as well as shaved gold on the side. Sliced filet - Im not going to go into detail, just know that the answer is YES! (Is it fantastic? Is it cooked to perfection? Is the flavor wonderful? Is it a great cut?) Asparagus with Hollendaise - Awesome stuff.  Nice to have a great hollendaise that I didnt have to prepare. Service - Our server was so outstanding Im going to contact the manager at this location. Atmosphere - We had a corner table that gave us great privacy.  We could not hear our neighbors."
4,"Hey hotel room snobs, I am totally with you that swank hotel rooms are the best. But when thats not in your budget & you just need a decent place to crash in Old Town, this is your place. I think my room was like $48 a night. Thats cheaper than a cab ride home for some people. Plus they have free, albeit somewhat dodgy breakfast in the morning. I stayed for a few days, did some shopping & drinking. I could walk to Fashion Square, & cabs were cheap to anywhere in Old Town. Sure these places havent been remodeled since the eighties, but who cares when theres free wifi!"
4,"So I started this review over a month ago, and I still cant get the Duck Breast Tacos out of my mind. I dont remember much else at this point, except I got the Lazy Enchiladas and they were great too. But M got the aforementioned tacos, and their tender smoky goodness haunts me. I need to go back as soon as M gets home."
4,"Its brand new so it doesnt smell fishy yet.   It will soon just like all other Asian markets. Looks like they will have another place to eat inside but its still under construction from what I can tell. They have Durian, I really want to try one because they are supposed to be so gross and stink to high heaven. Banana blossoms?  How would I cook those things. Food is divided into ""Regions"" so if you want Japanese noodles you go to one isle, Korean noodles in another isle etc.  Its a bit confusing but fun to look at all the different stuff."
4,"This is the second time we visited India Gate. The service was as good as the last time we were there. The waiters are attentive and friendly, willing to explain in detail what and how each dishes were made (for those of us who has no idea what some of the items are on the menu) Cozy place to have a nice meal, reasonable price."
4,"Went here this morning around 10 am. There was like a 20 minute wait, but no biggie. Service was fast, orders were fresh and correct, and place was clean. It is the Waffle House, not a fancy joint. So for what it is, it was good. Plus the staff are all very easy going and create a fun lively atmosphere. Good for a casual breakfast."
5,"I love Honey Bears!  Ive been visiting their restaurants for years.  Ive been to the one on Van Buran, the one on Central and this one in Tempe.  They have the runniest sauce on earth but dang it tastes great!  I love the pulled pork sandwiches but not the long lines at lunch.  When I went after 1pm in the afternoon I stood in a line of one - me."
4,"This was so good I wonder why Mongolian BBQ hasnt sprung up in every city (hint, hint Alabama!) When you go in you pay for either a small bowl ($9) or a large bowl ($10). I got the small bowl and still had enough left over for another meal.  The ingredients are spread out in a buffet. You go along the buffet and fill your bowl with whatever you like. I chose chicken, lots of veggies and rice noodles. The trick, from what I can tell is to shove as much food in your bowl and then using the handy wax paper they leave out for you, smash it down into your bowl so you can fit even more in! At the end of the buffet are tubs of different sauces and a chalkboard with  instructions for different combinations. I am a bit of a traditionalist and mixed up the Mongolian sauce. You then hand your embarrassingly heaping bowl to the cooks who quickly stir fry it for you and then hand it back. Can I just say oh my God was this delicious without sounding vain because really I sort of cooked it myself? The ingredients were super fresh!  There is also a small bar with soup and rice, but I wouldnt waste my time with those if I were you! The BBQ was delicious and fun to prepare!"
5,"Satori to Kaigen! (Enlightenment and Spiritual Awakening!) 1st review.  Nervous and working on an empty stomach, with the only exception being the half loaf of French bread and herb-butter I had consumed prior to dinner. Thinking Asian all day and being an incapable decision maker, I rely on Yelp and the assistance of a small list and a single 6 sided cube with dots on it.  I jotted down 6 prominent businesses, held my breath and flicked a wrist.  A ""2"" brought me to Las Thai Cuisine! Peeped the website and open til 9:30, score! My eye spotted closing time was at 9:00 though!  Arriving on the scene at 8:49, poorly reverse parking my Honda in two spots because I was worried that they were closed.  They werent, I was met by a Thai beauty introducing herself as Lisa.  I humbly asked for takeout, my adventure begins with the opening door... Smells are incredible.  Having thought they were closed, I had forgotten what I was going to order! I rifled through the menu, feeling as if the whole kitchen was watching (they werent) but she instructed me to take my time; So I ordered a soup, a salad, an entree, a dessert and a side of brown rice. They kindly ask me for my preference on the degree of heat, on each item, I asked for not the hottest but close to the top. #17  Mixed Vegetable Soup: Stellar Culinary Thought: Clear, piping, spicy and vegetable packed.  Ninja Eating Plan: Gently lay over white and brown rice, alternately. # 9   Papaya Salad (Som-Tum): Phenomenal Culinary Thought: I got shrimp on the side, due to allergies.  This was probably the most awesome experience of the evening.  They even ""fenced in"" the shrimp within a Masai-esqe cage of cabbage, to prevent their oceanic brine from invading the delicate papaya, sprout and carrot forest. Spice and crunch with every munch. Beautiful. Ninja Eating Plan: Try not to be seen scarfing this down in front of a date, its that awesome. Fortunately, my sister was only present and she knows I can eat like a pig and sound like one, too. # 53 Peanut Curry (Panang curry style, comes with rice!): Umami Culinary Thought: I dont like coconut. I do now. The lemon and coconut milk rises through the savory peanut curry.  Tofu was my protein option, it was done perfectly.  Green beans provided great consistency in this masterful crescendo. Ninja Eating Plan: Laid over rice, alternately brown and white rice, interrupted by the occasional, gorgeous, curry-only spoonful.   Coconut Ice Cream: Yum Culinary Thought: I was reeling at this point but I wanted to continue this experience.  As I stated earlier, coconut is not my thing but I believe in giving things a fair try, so I did.  Coconut ice cream is delicious. Coconut pulp, or meat, I still have a texture issue with, but the honey swirl throughout the ice cream made this delectable. Ninja Eating Plan: Use the cooling ice cream energy to return your body back to normalcy. Perfect coda for the culinary symphony. I will be back.  I plan to have every dish vegetarian style.  Family-run places are truly number 1.   Overall experience of the Culinary Ninja: PAVLOV Do you hear the sound of a bell chiming?"
1,"If we were able to give 0 stars... I would ask to give -1. I live nearby, and am sad to see that a coffeeshop that sells coffee this horrible is still in business in my neighborhood. Not only was the breve mocha that I ordered disgusting, so was the process of watching the barista make my drink. They use hersheys chocolate from a dirty nacho cheese style pump with chocolate sauce dripping down the sides, and coagulated into a thick cap at the tip of the nozzle.  *Disgusting.   The espresso shot was made without care, or concern for the fact that it was done way too quickly, and with espresso grounds that were ground way before I walked in the door.  Possibly way before the barista started her shift.   *Gross And finally.  The milk.  She steamed the milk with the automatic steam wand.  This was a huge red flag.  Those are notorious for burning milk and making disgusting drinks.  Well, both were accomplished.  The steam wand was tinted white from lack of cleaning.  And the worst part was that near the end of the wand was a DARK CHEESE that had accumulated from burning milk and not cleaning the wand after every use.  Which is FREAKIN - DISGUSTING. I wasted 5 bucks on an overpriced small mocha, and threw it away after taking a sip.   Hundreds of businesses in the area close down every year, and there are more realty signs in strip malls in this neighborhood than actual storefronts.  AND I really dont understand why this place hasnt joined the many defunct businesses and starry eyed entrepreneurs in the unemployment line.   If you own a coffeeshop.  Coffee should be your passion.   If you own a bait shop.  Fishing should be your passion. If you just want to open up a business that mirrors a nearby popular chain (short, tall, grande), please stop wasting space in the strip mall and get a day job in a cubicle. Never going back, warning my friends about this place, and am probably going to contact the health department on Monday."
4,"The burgers here are pretty average.  Thin, flat, kind-of greasy patties with lettuce and tomato.  But what sets this place apart is their other offerings.  My husband got the tri-tip steak sandwich and he said that it was delicious.  The meat was very tender and cooked perfectly.  I loved the fact that they serve sweet potatoes fries.  Those have become very popular lately but this is the only fast food place I know of that has them.    The ones I tried were cooked perfectly and very lightly salted.  The onion rings were also cooked just right with no soggy pieces.  I thought that the batter to onion ratio was slighly scewed toward the former but my hubby thought they were perfect.  Their regular fries are also very good.  I tried the chocolate shake and it was really yummy too.  I think its great that you can get a veggie burger here as well as a tuna steak sandwich.  The extra toppings they offer such as sauteed mushrooms, avacado, and teriyaki and BBQ sauce are all a big plus as well. The decor is simple since it is a fast food joint.  The booths were big and comfy and the faux leather looked slightly more upscale than you would expect.  We went on opening day so the service was phenominal.  We didnt have to wait long for our order and everything was to our specifications.  Servers came by serveral times to pick up trash and offer to refill our drinks.  The restroom was very small but clean. I try not to eat fast food too often but I will consider coming back next time I am craving a burger.  Or maybe Ill give one of their salads a try.  They earned a repeat visit from me and an extra star since they donated 100% of their opening day profits to Phoenix Childrens Hospital.  A big thanks to Sarah S for posting that on Yelp events page so that we could contribute... and fill our bellies!"
4,"Wow-- SO many breakfast options I had a hard time deciding what to order.  Theyve got skillets, scrambles, and omelets galore.  Not to mention two baked pancakes that sound amazing.  Ill definitely be back to try those.   During my recent visit I went with the New Mexican Skillet, which consists of eggs, chorizo, avocadoes, cheese, and tomatoes served over nice crispy hash browns.  The chorizo was well-seasoned and not too greasy.  I appreciate that they have the options of egg whites or Egg Beaters, although I dislike the up-charge!  But you cant put a price on health (says the woman eating chorizo and hash browns).  The fresh-squeezed orange juice was delicious. Portions are huge here.  Supposedly the skillets have two eggs, but I think I got more like 4, and the scramble at another table looked like it had about six.  Even though the place was full, the service was excellent.  Just know that you may have to wait a while for a table if you go on a weekend."
4,"repeat after me: creamy polenta covered with young brocolli stems and seared sea scallops!!!!!!!!! yum. repeat after me: buratta with charred bread, heirloom tomatoes and drizzed with olive oil!!!!!!!!! yum. repeat after me: asparagus, radiccio and hearts of palm salad with truffle oil!!!!!!!!! omg yum. repeat after me: chicken stuffed with marscapone cheese, fig and other stuff thats really yummy! yum. repeat after me: spicy spagetti with fruite de mare - clams and mussells!!!!!!! yum. repeat after me: ravioli stuffed with goat cheese and other yummy stuff!!!!! yum. cute and attentive waitier:  yum :) i stayed at the firesky and had dinner at taggio for two nights in a row - not by design but necessity and im here to report that even though i didnt choose this restaurant for both meals, id come back again in a heartbeat."
4,"The pho was good and a generous portion, but compared to most Vietnamese places... way over priced. The owner is very nice and entertaining :) The spring rolls were decent, but smaller than most places for the price. It still beats anything in the west valley."
5,"Brought my car here b/c of the reviews I read on yelp. My fan was running excessively. The mechanic came and looked at my car. The coolant was low. He grabbed a can and filled it up. No charge. I then told him I needed new struts. He quoted me a price that was cheaper than the one quoted to me in CO a few months ago. I honestly didnt shop around for a cheaper price here in Phoenix, which is unlike me. The reviews here, and fixing my fan problem at no charge had me sold. It seems so rare to find an honest mechanic now-a-days, especially in this economy.  Made an appt. Car was finished super quick, in the time frame that was promised. The mechanic went out of his way to show me the damage struts he replaced, then told me my new struts came with a lifetime warranty. Dang, did I time warp back into the 50s?  Hopefully I wont have a need to go back, but if I do, Id gladly drive out of my way one hour round trip for their honesty again."
5,"My gf and I just tried the Oggie bc we werent super hungry.  Even with that, the food was super yummy.  I wonder what would happen to us if we are actually starving.  the sauce that came with the Oggie was excellent too, so I suggested that you shouldnt eat the pasty without the sauce.  The decoration in the store is quite unique: church pews and wall and table deocrations.  Its a must go if you are around the area."
1,This was the second time I placed an order over the phone that was delayed over an hour. I was told over the phone that it was going to be only 15-20 min for me to pick it up. I showed up 30 min later and my order was still delayed. I ended waiting for another half of hour to receive my order. The pick up service was the worse I have ever experienced.
2,"I had high hopes for this restaurant, but to be honest, it let me down.  The wild mushroom and goat cheese salad was phenomenal.  From there it was downhill.  Great ambiance, though I think they are trying too hard to be a steakhouse.   Most importantly though...  Given it is a seafood restaurant, they sure didnt know how to cook my fish.  It was fried and oily (and was not marketed that way on the menu!)  I wanted something light and left feeling like I ate a ton of bricks.  My friends scallops - she said they were ""okay"" and not better than that. Oh, and the prices are set as if it were a steakhouse too. (Note: if it were, which its not.) Mediocre at best."
5,Cant say enough good things about Sens. Excellent food and excellent service.
5,Dr. Koch and his staff are wonderful! I know that I am in great hands and being given the best care possible. They do a great job at working you in to the schedule if you have a last minute pain that needs some extra attention. I would highly reccomend Arizona Chiropractic to anyone!?
1,"This is going to be brutal.  Hide the children. If youve been to Chipotle, youll feel right at home at Qdoba. That is, until you start eating. Complete and utter ripoff of the concept, except for the part that matters - the execution.  Where Chipotle succeeds, Qdoba fails miserably.  The ingredients are orders of magnitude shittier.  The burritos are just plain bad..  My burrito was loaded with rice and beans and very little meat - basically the opposite of what youll get at the ""other"" place.  On top of that, the rice and beans were the suck.  And if you know Brak, you know that he LOVES his beans.  But not these.  About all theyre good for is a massive bean fart shortly after ingesting this crap. If you want to know the root cause of this debacle, check out who the parent company is - its Jack In The Crack®.  Pretty much explains it all. Avoid at all costs.  Receives Braks dreaded zero-star review, rounded up to 1 because Yelp doesnt allow a zero."
5,"I dont know what I would do if this store ever closed.  Its right near our home, has an excellent selection of both wine, meats, and produce.  Note that wine is mentioned first... I cant help it!  The service is always really good too.  Everyone who works here seems like they really love their job.  The only issue I have ever had was not being able to get basil a couple of times.  I got over it.  :D"
5,"The line was ridiculous.  The price is kind of steep for what it is.  The dog is kind of messy because of the way its made.  But you know what?  I enjoyed it in a way I havent enjoyed a hot dog in years!  Wow, that sounds kind of dirty.  This really is a unique take on one of the most common American foods. I passed through the sea of trucks and people that is Food Truck Fridays on a mission to finally try the much yelped about Short Leash Dogs.  I cant say much too much that hasnt already been said.  While the 20 minute wait wasnt too thrilling, it all paid off in the end.  I just went with a traditional wiener, with tomatoes, onion, relish and spicy mustard.  While I was intrigued to try some of Short Leash Dogs specialties, most of the dogs on todays menu contained an item or two that I dont really like, and I wanted to compare Short Leash Dogs to what I am accustomed to the first time around.  Good sausage, good toppings and the flat bread is fantastic.  I would happily join Lindsey F. by tying my leash to the cart and following them around town.  And I didnt even know that I still enjoyed hot dogs that much without a beer and a game!"
4,"This place isnt the best looking, but its pretty tasty! I find myself craving the strange mix of foods they serve here. I order the Emerald chicken burrito and the Jerk Chicken quesadillas. The best part is if youve never been there before, they give you tons of samples and tell you all about the foods you can order.  I wish they had more locations :)"
4,"My family comes here for cases of citrus every year. The navels and tangerines are delicious, and very reasonably priced. They also have lots of other interesting local products like a variety of honeys."
4,"4.5: The only thing keeping this place from 5 stars is the location. The view from the patio is pretty much parking lot and the backs of buildings.  But, holy cow! The wine selection is VERY good. The staff are friendly and helpful and make excellent suggestions (thanks for the zinfandel tip! YUMMM). The prices are fair too! And, as much as I love green chile, my new fave is the fig and gorgonzola app. Still a pannini... I didnt know blue cheese could get that creamy when it melted! Man, I wish this place was closer... Ill still be back!"
5,"What else can I say that hasnt been said already?   Im weirdly glad that theyre not closer ( in fact very far away from me) because Ill be there every day = gaining tons of weight! My baby loved the mango lassi flavor! So much he did the sign for ""more "" for the first time at the store:) I do want to try the bacon flavor....so a trip soon is in order"
1,Whats with the cheese?  It isnt even Velveta.  Its liquid cheese food and it belongs somewhere other than on my burger. $5 burger and fries is a great deal IF -- IF -- its a great deal.  This is just liquid cheese food on a hamburger patty.  McDonalds will do a burger and fries for $5 thats tastier than this dump.
5,Im a big fan of their strawberry water and if Im looking for a better lunch than what I have at home Ill swing by and pick up a salad from here.  They have a good selection- and its constantly expanding.
4,"BEST CARNE ASADA (GRILLED SLICED STEAK), HACIENDA-STYLE HOSPITALITY. A MEXICAN FOOD EXPERIENCE IN THE THEME-PARK STYLE. --colorful, tasteful, vibrant ambiance in the country-hacienda style; kudos to the designers with an eye for detail; --dining room draws natural light from the delightful patio windows to the vaulted ceilings above; --this place and the adjacent ranch market are a ""must-do"" for tourists (bring your out-of-towners here); --Dont miss the Parrilla (grilled platter); one ""portion"" serves two; choose three meats and voice your tortilla preference; --grilled vegetables include nopales (cactus), Mexican zucchini squash, jalapenos (consumed whole, took me to five hiccups before my stomach settled), and baby onion stalks (not the typical pile-o-fajita yellows); --both rice and beans served family style, and perfectly flavored. I could just sit and eat bowl after bowl of those beans; --juicy, perfectly cooked shrimp; ""asada"" goodness knows no bounds; --guacamole is plentiful (no melon-ball scoops of yesterday at $3/ea here!) and freshly made to order; NOW THATS what Im TALKing about !!! --table salsa is spicy with lots of freshly chopped chilis and pureed onions; really good burn; --try the horchata (rice milk and cinnamon sugary goodness) or any of the featured Aguas Frescas. --no fuss over separate checks (and that was for our table of 10!) --pork was a bit dry; is ""gamey"" possible in pork? --server forgot our desserts and we gave up after 20 minutes (shucks! they were sitting right there on the pass!); the manager refunded us promptly and then packaged them to-go. After so many recent disappointments on rock-hard rubbery shrimp, I _finally_ found a place that grills properly, excellent marinade, and with the freshest ingredients. If you get the impression that you are amidst a food operation staffed by thousands, you are correct: several hundred are working in the kitchens next door making tortillas, cheese, asada, aguas and more! If you dont have a filthy-rich Mexican relative with a hacienda (Mexican mansion) across the border, this may be the closest youll get without an invitation. The mostly-abandoned courtyard is centered with a gigantic fountain, lined with what could be booths for a seasonal market, bodas, or other festival. In the corner a lush garden with a somewhat secret door leading to la sala, the grand room. Dont miss the Ranch Market next door; you wont see retail food sold in this quantity anywhere else in town. Take your camera."
4,I tried this place on a recommendation of a friend. Their frozen yogurt is really good. The peanut butter flavor was rich and creamy. They also had a wide array of toppings. The only downfall is they were a bit pricey. I had the small cup whcich was not even full but once it was weighed cost almost 4 dollars. I would still say very yummy and worth trying.
4,"Great organic fruits and veggies....very clean store...great customer service....fantastic deli dept....fresh fruits and veggies (non-organic)....and outstanding deals every week. I know some people say it is overpriced a bit and that is true to an extent....but the sales ad that comes every week is a must see and you will always find plenty of affordable items. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!"
5,"If you desire true Chicago deep dish pizza, then Nellos should be at the top of your list! This is a staple pizza location in the Valley- and my family has been going for years. Nellos offers a great menu, drink list, and atmosphere. They offer an excellent Mon-Fri lunch special - a large drink, salad and 2-topping personal pizza for $8.99- what a steal! Dont pass this place up, its worth it."
4,Coach house is your favorite dive bar...this bar reminds me of almost every shit hole in the upper peninsula of Michigan. A great little spot to throw back a few beers after a rough day.  Drinks are cheap and the staff is friendly. Plenty of games to play and TVs to watch.  If you have never been I would definitely check it out.
5,"One of a kind place to experience all senses!!  Food was great, service was great, AND they have a Moroccan Healer on staff.  Ask to taste the Moroccan Black Stone (not on normal menu).  I wont spoil how it makes you feel, but trust me when I say you will enjoy yourself! ;)"
4,I hate Thai food and Im not a huge fan of curry but this place has changed my mind. Very reasonably priced and always a great option at lunch because they handle the traffic very well. Not only am I back on the Thai bandwagon but my favorite dish is the green curry seafood.
4,I really like this store.  The customer service is great.  I wish it werent so expensive but I guess you get what you pay for.
4,"Pf changs is pretty good, there changs spicy chicken is a really good dish, the service is great! I go there almost every two weeks."
5,"Jeremiah is great! He is very friendly, patient, and knows what hes doing!  We started off with the Drunken Cheesy Bread, its ok. Not something I would want again. Nothing wrong with it, just not my taste.  For lunch, I had the Chicken Parmesan sandwich, along with a house salad. The sandwich is great. Loved it.  The house salad... I mean, I could not stop eating it. I have no idea which kind of dressing was on it, but it was AMAZING. I am craving it just thinking about it.  The interior is very clean, roomy, very casual. I heard they have great happy hour, so I will be back again."
5,"I have had a great experience every time I have been there.  The food is hard to beat and the service was pleasant.   Portions are reasonable, not huge (Im a big feller), and I was satified every time I ate there.   Very pleasant environment, clean, spacious and calm."
3,"Took my family here for dinner.  The hamburgers were really good.  I had the regular charburger, and i liked it quite a bit.  It was better than most of the fast food chains, but Id rank it below the higher end burgers from places like Fuddruckers or Red Robin.   For the price though, I was very satisfied.  My 8 year old really liked her charburger with cheese, but my other daughters did not like the grilled cheese at all.  I was not impressed by either the regular or sweet potato fries, but the onion rings were good.  We did not get any dessert, although the sundaes and milk shakes looked really appealing.  Well try those next time."
5,"I love the fish tacos from Rubios, I always order them. Well sometimes I get the shrimp or Salmon tacos and I also love that black salsa chipotle sauce and the chips are delish here."
4,"My parents and I went to here after leaving a previous restaurant for poor service. Big Buddha was the the complete opposite! They were attentive, the food was steaming hot and delicious. Definitely recommend for dine-in or event take out. The Singapore Noodles and Honey Walnut Chicken are definitely must tries."
2,"This place has potential but I didnt care for the layout.  Long bar is neat but instead of all the small tvs they should have put in bigger ones and spread them out.  The large screens are neat, but sitting in the uncomfortable chairs sitting to close to them was bad planning.  I believe the owner is a Sooners fan so that game rules over others, even Devils games.  The volume wasnt on for the Devils game, wth.  Waitress was lazy, didnt come by the table often.  Chicken Tenders were good, with sweet and sour sauce.  Sweet Potato Fries are gross, doesnt taste anything like em.  Id go to hang out and not expect much in the future."
5,"I can now thank the Humane Society for not only giving me my dog Brutus when I was a child, but now my dog Harley as an adult. A couple of years ago, I planned a visit to the Arizona Humane Society to present them with a corporate donation on behalf of my old company. When I scheduled the meeting, they offered to give me a tour of the vicinity and as a friend of the helpless animals, I said of course and planned my visit. However, I knew that with a tour, I might be in some trouble in the willpower department.  When I arrived to the center, I was greeted by a pretty view of South Mountain and a wide open vicinity. I walked inside and immediately noted how clean it was for being home to many a furry creature. The staff was warm and welcoming as potential new ""parents"" waited in the lobby to adopt a new friend. Kittens and bunnies greeted the guests and there was a special area for the cats being featured that week. The vicinity was a five star facility to say the least and I could immediately tell that the animals were treated well here and in good hands until they found a new home.  To make a long story shorter, they gave us a detailed tour of the complex. I walked through spacious room after spacious room full of dogs of all kinds just wanting a home. As I walked up to one of the cages, a furry ball of fluff looked up at me and placed his paw on the cage. I fell in love immediately. To make matters worse, the staff then took us into a room where we could make a kong of peanut butter and treats for our dog of choice. Of course I had to give it to my new found friend. At that point I knew I was in trouble and could very well be leaving with a dog. So to end that part of my story, I did leave with a dog and Harley has been happy in his new home ever sense.  While I visited the Humane Society, I couldnt get over their quality of service for not only the clients but the animals themselves. They were clean, kept in spacious areas and they even had a huge playground for the animals to play in each and every day. When i found Harley and started to think about taking him home with me, they took me to a private play area where I could get to know Harley a bit more to make sure he was the right dog for me. A staffer stayed in the area and helped me with any questions I had. When I made the decision to take Harley home with me, they neutered him, gave me a couple free vet visits and sent me home with some treats, food and a leash. They even have a pet store to pick up all your essentials for your new friend. And did I mention that the proceeds go back to the Humane Society...a nonprofit?  This Arizona Humane Society is a five star pet resort that focuses on making the most of a pets stay until they find a new home. I suggest just taking a visit to the facility to see how well-kept it is. They even have horses that they rescued. Sorry folks, they are not up for adoption though. So thank you Arizona Humane Society for bringing my little dog Harley to me and saving so many animals from the streets."
4,"I have been wanting to try Big Daddys since it opened and finally today was the day for some lunch there!  I was expecting cold mac and cheese based on some of the reviews, so imagine my surprise when it burned six layers of flesh off my tongue.  The mac was HOT, the sweet potato fries were HOT and my pulled pork was HOT, so I do not see what the fuss is about. The fries are a little on the heavy, sweet  side so I could only eat a few but they are pretty good. The mac was dreamy and thank you for including some of the browned/burnt crusty stuff from the top... mmm I am a simple man and easily pleased, I guess.   Overall I cant give it 5 stars because I think its a tad overpriced, but I still think the value is good. Ill be back to work my way through some ribs and wings and wash down with beer next time..."
1,"If I could give zero stars, I would.  I have never spent more time looking for a bar than I have looking for this. And not like a cool underground dance club in L.A.  When we finally found this sh*thole sandwiched between two vacant businesses, it was barely visible.  The sign for it looked like it was written with a sharpie on a piece of cardboard and someone duct tapped a flashlight to it.  Before we even entered the bar, as my friend and I were walking up two redneck bikers whispered, ""Fags"" as we walked by them.  I dont think these were the kind of guys you argued with so I let it go.  When we entered the bar I noticed several ""No firearms"" signs plastered on the walls.  Im assuming theyve had a problem with this before.  Remember that scene in the Blues Brothers where they go to the country bar and get the look of death from the patrons?  Thats how I felt.  The decor of this bar was interesting.  It looked as if they got the tables and chairs from an old 70s Vegas casino.  The place is about the size of a small apartments living room so getting a seat is pretty much impossible.  We went to the bar to do some karaoke, but apparently they also sell crappy jewelry for some reason?  Weird.  Ive also never heard so much cussing from karaoke singers.  One of the drunken hicks actually got into a shouting match with one of the morbidly obese toothless tattooed bicker chicks where they argued who was the bitch and who was the pussy.  Halfway through my beer, my friends showed up and they refused to go inside so I ran away and never looked back.  TIP: If you go here wear a black leather jacket, bandana and Harley Davidson gear."
4,"Having a record store in the Memorial Union always made me nervous.  Nearly everything in that building is specifically designed to rip students off and I didnt think that Hoodlums could possibly be an exception. Fortunately, that assumption was incorrect.  Hoodlums had a diverse selection, awesome sales, and an incredibly knowledgeable staff.  The went well beyond the pop charts and were always helpful.  The atmosphere was nice, particularly once they moved into the basement. The store suffered smoke damage in a fire last autumn and the store is not going to re-open in the union.  On their website, it states that it should reappear in the future in another location and I have my fingers crossed."
2,"I like Rubios in general, but this location is pretty hit or miss on the food quality and service.  I prefer the one on the other side of the I-10 next to the movie theater."
2,"This is a cool place for low key hanging out, killing time, chatting and relaxing with friends.  It is NOT a good night spot and doesnt work as an event venue like they seem to be trying to make it. Ive attended 2 events there and its basically a disaster in trying to make your way through the 200-300 patrons they bring in.  You get funneled in past the food trailer into the bar area which is packed with people standing among several oversized tables.  Only if youve been there before can you figure out that you can walk towards the boxing ring past the crowd to get behind the stage and into the retail area.  Once there you have to get a spot among the wares to watch the back (or the side) of the show that is going to take place facing the bar.  Both times I stood the entire night with my drink next to a display of $50 t-shirts.  Very nerve wracking and annoying. 1.  The old timey way they make drinks is very cool and the drinks are delicious but I have waited now 35 and 45 minutes each on different nights to actually get a single mixed cocktail.  Its insane how slow it is. 2.  There are rules to what you can get at which station.  One spot is just wine.  Another spot is just mixed drinks.  Lemonade - oh thats a different place entirely.   3.  They use the boxing ring as the ""stage"" for shows.  Very hard to view the show there because of the odd angle its at.  Both times Ive had to stand in the retail area while the performers faced the seating/bar area (which only seats about 75 people). To pay more than $10 to see a performance at this place is outrageous.  If the owners want to be an event venue they could do it simply by doing some rearranging and investing in some more seating."
2,"I always hate giving bad reviews, but our service left quite a bit to be desired. I can normally dismiss such things, but it became evident that our bad service was not a fluke. We arrived around 10:00 and was told that food would only be served until 11. That wouldnt be a problem at all except that our waitress didnt return with menus until close to 10:30 and then returned to take our orders at only a few minutes before 11. The place had other patrons, but it certainly wasnt so busy as to take an hour to get our orders. Unfortunately, on each of our visits, the waitress was half listening and seemed easily confused The food itself was quite good. The Shepherds pie was hot and tasty and the bloody marys were actually perfectly spiced. Neither was worth getting excited about, but they were certainly decent and reasonably priced.  Considerably later in the evening, our waitress returned with the bill. There was one extra drink on the bill which no one ordered and she was perfectly friendly about saying shed remove it, but we spent a good five minutes as she kept getting confused about our - apparently - very complicated instructions of ""$20 on the credit card. The rest in cash"" She continually read back excessively complex scenarios, and we kept asking her simply to put twenty on the card, thats all. When she returned, she had taken $20 of our cash towards the bill, charged $60 to the card and kept the remaining $55 in cash as a tip. Thats just shy of a 75% tip she assigned herself.  We spoke to the manager, who couldnt find her for some time, and when she showed up, she blamed us repeatedly. She finally refunded the card and brought us our new bill, with the extra drink. It wasnt worth arguing about at that point. The sad part is that everyone at my table, and our surrounding tables started telling similar tales from past visits. I guess this kind of service is not uncommon."
5,"Once we went to Grimaldis in Hoboken, NJ and werent all that impressed.  Yet the first time we ate at this Grimaldis, we were blown away!   Upon entering, you are enveloped by the aroma of pizza baking in a coal-fired oven.  This is swoon-inducing---and I mean that in a good way.  The smell almost has you believing that you are in a pizza joint with a coal-fired oven in the Northeast. When ordering pizza baked in a coal-fired oven, I like to get a plain cheese pizza.  IMO, this is the best way to fully taste the sauce, cheese and crust without anything else get in the way.   Theres nothing like a thin crust pizza from a coal-fired oven with that char on the crust.  The crust has just the right balance of crispy and soft.  The sauce is well flavored with proper proportions of basil and oregano.  The amount of cheese is just right.  I love to savor each and every bite. There is more to this Grimaldis than the one under the Brooklyn Bridge.  This one has other items in addition to the pizza.  We like their antipasto.  It has sliced mozzarella which is fresh and creamy, black and green olives (the black ones are pitted, the green ones have pits in them),  roasted red pepper slices which are bursting with flavor, and a good, flavorful salami. Everytime were in AZ, it is so worth it to us to deal with the heavy traffic in Old Town Scottsdale to dine at Grimaldis!"
5,"My first visit to Sweet Republic and when I was done my first thought was, ""why did I take so long to come here!?"" I sampled a few of their ice creams and let me tell you.  All delicious.  In particular the mint chip ice cream was delicious.  It tastes like fresh mint because get this... it is! Service was quick and friendly.  We got in right before a rush and let me tell you, the staff were able to handle it like pros. Each of their ice creams are homemade and you can just taste the love mixed into each one.  You can tell how proud they are of their creations.  I wont go into the kinds of ice cream they have but can tell you that whatever you choose, you will love. Stop on down, took me 30 minutes to get there from Gilbert, and enjoy a cone or cup.  Do yourself a favor and dont delay for 3 years like I did!"
4,"I have been craving some soul food for quite some time, so I kicked and screamed til someone finally took me to Lolos. After memorizing the menu for weeks, I knew I wanted the Baby Ray. So we go in and I was overjoyed that they had a band playing some sweet grooves. I jammed out a lil while waiting for about 10 minutes. We were seated in a nice lil half booth/table combo and had a huge jar of koolaid and sweet tea delivered to us. Yum! I starting getting the biggest sugar rush halfway through the wait. When my food did arrive, I was presented with two waffles bigger than my face, 3 big pieces of chicken smothered in enough gravy and onions to fill a whole gravy boat. The chicken was spectacular, really good flavor and crisp(when not soaked in gravy, get it on the side?). Gravy was pretty good as well.  The waffles were alright, I cant say I am the biggest waffle fan, but the subtle cinnamon flavor was nice. I think the waffles could have been better in my opinion. I am kicking myself for not trying the grits and collared greens or the red velvet cake. I could not finish my second waffle though, so much food, couldnt even think. The service was probably a B-. The hostess was bubbly and sweet. Our server was busy and a little frazzled maybe. The server gave us the wrong change and seemed to not believe that she had. Waiting for the correction was longer than average for sure. Overall, though, I had a good time, perfect way to end my weekend."
5,"For those of you who love Indian/Pakistani food, but hate dives, Z-Grill just may turn your whole world upside down. In all foodie honesty, Z-Grill is home to some of the best Indo-Pak food Ive ever had. This praise comes with a reminder though...it is divey. Z-Grill is located inside Zam Zam World Market, which is a decent little grocery, but it lacks the umph that other well-known ethnic groceries delivery. With that being said though, other groceries lack Z-Grill, and this is why it matters... Everything Ive tried from the restaurant, and I mean everything thus far, delivers. From the hummus, to the samosas, to the chana and even to the paneer masala and chicken karahi, Ive only been disappointed when I realized that I was down to the last bite. The flavors are robust, the sauces are spicy and, surprisingly, the prices are unbelievably reasonable.  Its safe to say that Im addicted to this place.  **A word of caution when trying Z-Grill. They are sometimes out of items on the menu. I find that charming cause they have to make everything from scratch, others might not. If they happen to be out of something, do yourself a favor and just try something else.** I cannot say enough good things about the food from Z-Grill. This is a must-try in the valley for anyone who has a love for spicy Indo-Pak food. Go try it!"
5,"Piestewa and Camelback Peaks are the two boobs of Phoenix. Theyre real, and theyre spectacular.  Of course, being all-natural one is just a slight bit larger than the other, but this is barely noticeable. Camelback is barely 100 feet higher than Piestewa, whose nipple... er... summit, is at 2608 feet. Climb either one and you can enjoy great views of the other at various vantage points, not to mention views of the city.  Although Camelback strikes me as a funner climb, I give Piestewa 5 stars because for what it lacks in the intangible fun factor it makes up with being just a tad less insanely crowded. Piestewa Peak Park also has a number of really cool looking trails that dont go up to the summit, which look to me to be worth exploring some day. Speaking of female body parts, the former name for this peak was ""Squaw"" Peak. This has inspired one of the most ridiculous controversies in modern times in our state. Native Americans are offended by the term ""Squaw"", and regardless of the linguistic origins of the word, it is basically the equivalent of terms such as ""Negress"" or ""Jewess"". In the 1990s, the State of Arizona proposed ending the controversy by renaming the peak after our greatest political leader ever and the father of American conservatism, Barry Goldwater. The whining dipshits who apparently constitute our voting population rejected the idea. Theyd rather continue using a stupid name that has no historical or sentimental value whatsoever just to spite Native Americans, rather than honoring one of their finest citizens. And so, in this decade, Democratic Governor Janet Napolitano put an abrupt end to the whole issue. She gave the sqaw-apologists the finger and ordered the renaming of the peak to Piestewa, after Lori Piestewa, the first US woman soldier to be killed in the 2003 Iraq war and a member of the uniquely-Arizonan Hopi Nation. A fitting end to the debate. NOTE: Even more fitting, the original name of this peak was Squaw Tit Peak, and I swear to God Im not making that up to be funny."
5,"Suffered a senior moment today! Did the yelp check and thought this sounds good...the drive was very dejavu and then I discovered why....see previous review! lol .....but to update....the volcano appetizer, sedona roll and Mochi Icecream (which I am becoming addicted to) were all wonderful. Our waitress was also fantastic bringing plenty of their delicious iced tea and keeping the ginger bowl full....a necessity for me. The place was full tonight and I can see why. Question is will I remember?"
4,"I dont usually shop at AJs unless I am looking for something very specific that I cannot find anywhere else. The item in the past has been canoli shells. I like to make home made canolis occassionally but I am never daring enough to make the shells. I can never find them anywhere other than AJs. I would say that if you are looking for something special that the average grocery store doesnt have, try AJs. They are a bit expensive though so I would go here as a last resort. Now normally, I would give this place only 3 stars, however, yesterday, I discovered their dessert counter. OMG, I was in heaven! I knew they had cakes and fruit tarts (which btw are outstanding although 30.00 apiece), however, they also have a vast array of mini gourmet desserts for when you have a major sweet craving and want something special to satisfy it. Im talking mini carrot cakes, mini fruit tarts (yes!!! I dont have to pay 30.00 whenever I want a tart from them), mini tiramisus rounds, brownies, canolis (WTF?) and even mini creme brulees! Additionally, they have home made chocolates which looked equally delicious. I opted for the tiramisu which was not only tantalizing but light, creamy, and honestly, one of the best Tiramisus Ive had in awhile probably since the wine train in Napa. My best friend said that her praline chocolates were very good as well. I got a brownie for the hubby which is enormous and I will post an update once he tries it. Whats even better is that the mini desserts are really reasonably priced so if you are looking for a dessert for someone to celebrate a birthday, anniversary, whatever, this is a great place to go."
4,"As a west coast girl, knowing what good soul food consisited of never my forte.  Then I moved to Atlanta for almost a year...driving...so i got to experience diff states in the souths sould food.  Collared greens always sounded scary to me and if you werent tuna, salmon or something i usually find on my sushi menu...you are prob a fish i havent bothered to give a chance :) well after having fried catfish with some great traditional sides while in Nashville, then again while living in ATL, i feel i can give a better opinion. Living in AZ, I was weary to even attempt to find some soul food.  But after reading some Yelp reviews, I decided Off Da Hook was worth a shot.   And thank goodness, because their catfish was amazing, collards were great and red beans and rice phenomenal.   Needless to say, ill be back.   If you are in AZ and appreciate great soul food, then maybe ill run into you :)"
4,"had the place to ourselves on a thurs nite (5/19) so...service great, mgr came over and asked if we had eaten here before ""nope"" so he said he wanted to buy dessert, ""great, thank you"" oreo cheesecake was good... now.... pizza...pricey by 2-4 bucks but was very good. cant go wrong with your toppings but the riccotta was not my cup of tea (wife liked it on her pizza). definetly going back to try it again... great crust"
5,"The staff is great, the food is great, even the cappuccino is great (had my first one today). i work close by and I have a choice where to eat and its very often Acacia for breakfast and lunch. A few of my favs are: - Chicken Salad Sandwich - Southwest Ranch Salad - Omelets Enjoy! (maybe Ill run into you there)"
5,"As a former Bay Area resident, I have come to love and appreicate all asian food. Generally, I prefer Japanese and Thai over Chinese, however, when it comes to Iron Chef its my favorite.  The location is perfect as its only a quick two or three minute drive from my house.  Their food is absolutely delcious and is on par with a high end chinese restaurant.  The quality of the meat, fish and vegetables is just excellent and its always very consistent.  I generally order the garlic chicken as I love spicy food!  Its a wonderful mix of vegetables and white meat and the sauce is perfect, full of flavor and not at all greasy.  I also like the fact that they offer brown rice as an option and their eggrolls are some of the best Ive tasted.   The family meal for $29.95 is an excellent value and is enough food for four or five people.   We ordered it for the two of us and had leftovers for a week!  It includes sweet/sour pork, broccoli beef, orange chicken, chow mein, fried rice, steamed rice, soup and eggrolls.   I sure hope that Iron Chef survives the recession.  I try to eat there as often as I can :)"
4,I had dinner at the True Food in Scottsdale on a Thursday a couple of weeks ago.  There is really nothing not to like here.  the restaurant itself is great looking and will be wonderful when the weather warms up as all the walls are glass doors.  I thought alcohol was well priced or least the wine was as you get glasses starting at $6.  we shared the lettuce cups as an appetizer and they were quite tasty although messy to eat as are all the dishes that use lettuce as a tortilla.  I had the puttanesca with a twist--no anchovies--instead with ahi tuna--it was quite tasty and was a right sized portion.  My sister in law had a tofu curry--that also was quite flavorful--even though I am not a fan of curry and can take or leave tofu.  head the chocolate cake for dessert which was just right.  I will definitely go back-all in all a pleasant evening.
4,"Ive been fortunate enough to stay at several Ritz-Carlton hotels around the US... San Francisco, Amelia Island, Atlanta, Buckhead, and Lake Oconee are the ones that stand out.  Ive also been to events at many of these locations and more and Ive always been blown away by how beautiful these hotels are and how incredible the service has been.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that the Ritz sets a standard for other hotels, and they are known for luxury! When I recently spent the night at the Ritz-Carlton Phoenix, I was not as blown away... the room was just ok - nothing so special, and I dont have any major complaints but I guess with my past experience and the reputation of the Ritz in general, I expected more.  (Dont hate me, Ritz-Carlton; Im still a fan, but maybe not so much of the Phoenix location compared to the rest). I will say that we did get a discounted room rate because I was being honored as one of AZs Finest and thats where the black-tie gala took place... and it was quite the event as well - we had a blast!   I took advantage of the fitness room for a quick workout after we checked in, and it was one of the nicer hotel fitness rooms Ive seen in awhile.  Unfortunately, the pool was closed for renovation during our stay, so my BF could not swim on site, but luckily they shuttled him over to the Biltmore to swim instead. So, overall, it was a pleasant experience - I just cant bring myself to give 5 stars like I would at any of the other Ritz-Carltons Ive been to... but stay tuned for my review of the Ritz-Carlton, Bachelor Gulch (which is where Ill be heading in December for a wedding) - that one looks like it may be the best one Ive seen yet!"
5,"I love this restaurant concept. It makes for a fun dinner between friends and family. I wish there were ones like it in Central Phoenix so I dont have to drive a half hour for good food and a good dining experience.  The veggie options offered are plentiful and fresh, which is important to me. The broth is so flavorful. But be warned weak tongued restaurant-goers, the spicy broth has a kick that will stick! Some are saying its too expensive? I think its worth it."
4,"BEST FRYS YET Feelin a little blue, need a doc? No big deal, stop on by... Forgot to cash in your last paycheck? Pshh, Bank of America ATM AND bank up in this joint Crammin for the next exam? Get your coffee fix on your way out Food, deli, bakery, flowers, home furnishings, school supplies, I dont know where it ends... All I need is a bed and I could live here... Oh wait, they sell them here too. And all this time I thought they just fixed computers and sold TVs"
4,"It was a quick trip downtown from Mesa, I didnt like some of the people getting on the train but hey its public transport. My legs were also hurting from the seats on the short trip downtown I have RLS and man it hurt for days after. It was great for saving gas and if I worked by one I would take it daily. This was my first time so watch where you park by the pickup locations cause I got my car towed, $200 fine!!! I would take it downtown again but park in the right spot this time."
4,"Yay I am a fan...ok for the ladies...this is a tough bit, I have shopped here with girls who literally will hide good finds in other places of the store so they can come back and get them later, most of the time they are gone.  Funny huh, this place literally looks worse then some of the barrio shops in rocky point, it seems like it is the day after thanksgiving every day there, and people literally throw stuff anywhere. For the guys this place is a pretty good place to go, the deals on shoes are unreal, nikes that are $100.00 bucks for like $20.00, you cant get that anywhere.  You can also get top notch clothing and make you look like a true Scottsdale deuschbag for less then 100 bucks Rolex or Tag Heur watches will not be found here, sorry deuschbaggery only goes so far at last chance.  In any event this is probably one of the best bargain basement places in the valley to get top notch stuff.   Two things you need to know about this place. 1. They restock every Sunday, so Sunday mornings here really are like every black Friday after thanksgiving, you might get trampled to death like that guy at Walmart or shot like those two dudes at Toys R Us..and it could be your last chance:) 2. Check all your shit seriously, allot of this stuff is here because it is damaged, so be careful they have no return policy that is why it is LAST CHANCE!"
5,One of favorite happy hour places in town. If you get the wings here it shouldnt matter if you get anything else. Great location and nothing else needs to be said. Maybe a renovation on the parking lot.
5,Best happy hour in north Scottsdale! Get there early to beat the crowd. Amazing cuisine and atmosphere.
4,"Dont be confused by the Yelp definition, ""Yay, Im a fan"",  Lowes gets 4 stars because they have great employees that get me out of there fast!  Im not one that would typically be classified as ""Handy"", so the fact that I can go into Lowes, and get someone to give me DIY instructions in about 5 minutes, makes me happy.  Ive been to several Lowes/Home Depots in the past, but I feel compelled to review this location, because after 10+ trips (mostly on the weekends), I have never had to wait for assistance or behind more than one customer in line.  Also, they get bonus points for not only allowing my pups in the building, but complementing them on their cuteness =)."
4,"Its rare that I have a date with my husband on a Monday afternoon/evening, but this past Memorial Day, we did just that.  After a quick visit to the Science Center (the Van Gogh alive exhibit is a must-see by the way), we were hungry so we headed over to Rice Paper.  Neither of us had ever been before, and we were pleased with our experience. It was a tad bit too hot to sit outside, although they do have a covered patio with misters.  We walked in and were seated and greeted promptly by Al, our server.  Hes quite the character.  He made us laugh quite a bit in addition to being attentive and making some recommendations.  We enjoyed the stylish renovated house / hip colorful atmosphere as well. We ended up ordering a few things and sharing.  Highlights included the firecracker shrimp. a spider roll, a shrimp roll, and a zen salad.  Everything was light and tasted fresh.  We really enjoyed the dipping sauces that came with the spring rolls.  Theyve got such a huge selection of the spring rolls, that I cant wait to return to try some of the others.  They dont have a huge selection of Vietnamese entrees, but it appears that they will custom create a bit upon request. I highly recommend going for the ""food happy hour.""  Its from 3pm - 6:30pm and includes $6 appetizers & $1 off all spring rolls.  Such a deal!  We didnt take advantage of it, but the ""drinks happy hour"" is actually 11am - 6:30pm and specialty drinks are $6, house wine by the glass is $5, well drinks are $4, and draft beer is just $2.75. If only Rice Paper was a tad bit closer to home, I could see myself being a regular... Instead, Ill keep it high on my list of spots to return to when I find myself heading downtown!"
5,Great fresh food and vegetarian options! I will definitely return!!
1,"The staff of this ""establishment"" are some of the rudest, most condescending individuals I have ever met in my life. They will not give you ANY money, and you will have much better luck at Sunset Clothing Exchange, which is right up the street (Plus they actually have friendly staff). The people who are buying the clothes should not be buyers; judging from the way that they style themselves, they know nothing about fashion whatsoever. Everyone who has stated that you will not get any money from them for designer items is right... they would much rather have trite, ""trendy"" studded vests from Target than a pair of Miu Miu sunglasses. I was there about a year ago, and one of their young female employees was laughing, snarking and making faces at me. I had no idea who she was. It got to the point where my friend actually pulled her aside and said something. Today, their manager called me something that I cant even print on here. I had never seen him in my life, either. I have never done anything to these people except for sell my clothes to them. Avoid this place at all cost, they should change the name to Juggalo Exchange."
4,"I was hella skeptical that a Phoenix fast food Mexican joint could top a Mission taqueria.  Rivas pleasantly surprised me.  I chose the two burritos with chicken meal that came with rice and beans.  Standard, but fulfilling rice and refried beans.  The burrito was a breath of fresh grilled veggies.  A warm tortilla filled with chicken, peppers and onions.  So simple and yet so mouth watering.  Best part was that the burrito was so big that I got to save the second one for my flight back to SF.  Oh, and this whole package was under $7."
3,"Sacks is a great little place.  One issue and I know this wouldnt seem like a bad thing (at least if you are the owner) but it is a bit too busy for me.  I can never find a parking place or a seat.  The sandwiches are good and I like them, but I will admit that sometimes I dont go just because of the crowds.   The food is good.  I like that they have a variety of sandwhiches and they put a lot of things on the sandwiches which can easily be taken off for the picky folks like me unlike other places where things are mixed in and not removable.  If you are looking for a good tastey sandwhich, this is a great place to check out.  If you are looking for a nice relaxing lunch where you can find a seat, move along."
4,For our first time we had a great time! Our server was very knowledgable about the menu especially the drink menu. Culinary Dropout has to have some off the most creative drinks Ive seen in a while. Everyone mentioned the pretzels on Yelp and they were right! The cheese sauce was velvety and delicious and the pretzel bites had the perfect texture. My girlfriend and I both couldnt finish our sandwiches because they are pretty big. I will definitely be going back to try the charcuterie menu.
1,"I have been here once for lunch and sat outside only to get eaten alive by flies, nothing worse than eating outside on a nice patio and being pestered the entire time.  I decided to give it another chance for happy hour, well guess what? flies followed me inside too.  I dont know if it was the time of year (early spring) or what, but they really need an exterminator!"
5,"This is  the best Asian restaurant in town! Previously Shanghai Palace, this out of the way restaurant serves up some of the best curry and pad Thai, that I have ever tasted in my life! The Panang Curry is so savory and aromatic, literally one of the best things I have ever had. I honestly crave this dish about twice a week. Also any thing on the menu can be made vegetarian this is a huge bonus for all veggies around town!  The Chef-owner Tottie Kaya, is always very hospitable. She walks around to each table making sure everything is up to standard. I have never once had a bad experience at this delicious eatery. So if you love Asian cuisine, you must dine at Totties!"
3,Today I went in for lunch and it seems the quality actually has gone down a bit it is still good pizza but the salad was a bit smaller and pizza just didnt have the same flavor.  You dont get that wood fired smoke taste which you would crave at a wood fired place.  Ill go back maybe today was a bad day as usually I like this place a lot.
3,"So Chase field you get 3 stars. Heres the problem(s) I have with the venue or CONS so to speak. 1. Cash Only almost EVERYWHERE, for a stadium named after a bank, dont you think someone would have taken finacial practice into better concern, perhaps CHASE just wants to sucker you more by making you pay their ATM fees if your not a member which I see as ""Greedy Fat Cat"" practices.  2. No real options in regards to ""regular"" ball park food, the Brats are a joke and at 6 bucks a pop, they dont even offer peppers and onions, strange that it shows it in the menu picture. Other than that its just another typical ""lets capitalize all we can"" with your typical crap chains (Fridays, Panda Express, etc) which I find pretty disgusting.   3. The ""Value"" beer stands..... Okay, when is a beer a ""value"" at 4 dollars, I mean  seriously, being that I just paid 6 bucks for a brat thats pretty pathetic Id at least like the decency of having a good size beer to help wash down the piss boiled frank I just overpaid the crap out of for. To sum it up, the value beer is tiny and the only one worth buying IMO is the 9 dollar 24 ouncer or even better, the 10.50 Corona, HA. Heres the PROS. 1. Damn good deal on seating prices, we sat in section 140 (lower level outfield) for 15 bucks a person, Not too shabby!  2. The stadium is rather beautiful, for a stadium that is.  3. Theres a pool in the outfield, cool idea  4. Parking is rather cheap (12 bucks) and has never seemed to be an issue. 5. Traffic control before and after games is surprisingly smooth   Overall 3 stars, I just think they need more originality instead of what ""Joe Sixpack"" wants while charging him Paris Hilton prices."
1,"I went here with Friends last Friday.  All my friends and I use Yelp, at the end of the meal taking cost into perspective we all came to this is a 1 star place.  It was a huge disappointment after looking at the positive reviews.  Our 1st disappointment came because they had a ""limited"" beer list.  My good buddy just wanted an IPA and all they had was the normal domestic beers and a few other quality ones.  Then, the Spanish ham was not very good and once you take into account the price it was terrible.  We had a sausage plate where the sausage was dry.  The Calamari was extremely oily.  The only positive thing was the lamb chops but once you factor in price that was poor too.  We all came to the conclusion we would never go back."
3,"A no frills hole in the wall hamburger joint.  The burger is cooked to order, delicious, and the perfect mix of juicy and slightly greasy so you know youre eating the real deal.  The fixin bar is an interesting concept which I like since I can pile on as many goodies as I like.  The bar gets a little messy at times, but eh, who cares. The burgers are not the cheapest, but then again if you wanted cheap youd go to a dollar menu, no?  Its worth the line, and fighting some of the students from across the street (Phoenix College) for a bite at Hamburger Works!"
4,"I went to Sabas feeling a little scared.  Fast food Greek in a strip mall?  This could go one of two ways...surprisingly good or health code violation bad.   I am very glad to say it didnt end being the latter.  In fact, the food here was pretty damn good.  I did expect Sabas to be an order at the counter joint, so I was a little disappointed to see it was actually a tiny restaurant.  I like my Greek fast and cheap, okay?  But I got over it, got a table and began the interminable wait for our server to stop chatting with other diners and take our order. The menu has all the normal Greek items, including falafel- little fried balls of joy I might add- gyros, vegetarian platters, spanakopita and dolmas.  Prices for the sandwiches and gyros are pretty cheap, but when you venture into the platter territory, youre going to pay for it. Platters start around $10 and go up.  I ordered the falafel, of course, and so did my boyfriend.  The pita sandwiches dont come with any sides, so we ordered a basket of fries to go along with our meal. The dcor was pretty cool with big pictures of Greece all over the walls and the classic Greek music piped in.  Unfortunately, not even the Greek music could mask the hideous, loud tool of a diner that was sitting at the table in front of me. He was one of those idiots that has to talk so loud, even the half-deaf cook in the kitchen can hear him.  He was so loud I felt like I should respond to his questions.  Hey moron- saying things like ""I like it loose, like my women,"" is just not funny. Anyways, when we finally got our food, it was really good.  The falafel pita and the fries were tasty, but our server sucked.  He obviously knew the loud tool, and kept chatting with him while we waited for our check.  That was a little annoying, but overall, Sabas is a good choice for a quick Greek meal."
4,"Reasonable prices, good service, over-priced snacks (like every other theater) and comfy seats! I do enjoy this AMC very much though when I have to come here versus the Harkins on Northern. The one MAJOR drawback and this is a BIG WARNING is that if you go on the day of a Cardinals home game, EVERYONE and I do mean EVERYONE has to pay $10 to park in the parking lots at Westgate. The parking attendants will give you a ticket to take inside and AMC has a person there to give you back the $10 but the fact that you have to pay it to begin with sucks. What if I didnt have cash on me? This by no means is AMCs fault. I suspect its the City of Glendales or the Cardinals convoluted way to soak people but at least you do get the money back if you are paying attention."
3,"Well the view is obvious.  I mean - it is decently high up and gives you a good view of downtown but, I dont know - the view from the Arizona Club is better.   We went here after watching a show at the Herberger and I was expecting some high class expensive dining that that is exactly what I got.  The service matched the price tag which was nice to see but the restaurant itself was disappointing.  Not only did they not have Coke or dark rum but they let poor Ashley A order a prime rib and then told her they were all out.   I had the drunken shrimp and they were pretty excellent.  The sauce around them was really good and they were resting on a piece of toast disguised as a crostini.  I also had a few bites of the lava cake but since it was buried under a pound of powered sugar, I couldnt eat any more. I guess I just agree with Beth Ss review...Im just not seeing what justifies the price.  The District in the Sheraton next door is a restaurant in a hotel that has amazing food that is priced better than this.  Plus, the view there isnt half bad."
4,"Go for the food and you wont be disappointed, great middle eastern dishes served up nice and generously whether you get it to go or for dining in.  I went here and ate in and there was initially no one in the restaurant but me and then it quickly filled up with people. So I know that this is a neighborhood spot. The gyros and tzatziki sauce are very good but so is the hummus, falafel, kibbi and shwarma."
3,Its a freeway. Traffic sucks near downtown but the views are nice through Dreamy Draw. I think I just saw Kurdy passing by!
1,"despite its billing as the largest thrift store in north america, im pretty sure this is the island of misfit goodwill items. the place is huge, but ive never, ever found anything good in this store. im not sure how thats possible. but i would never go out of my way to shop here. i have no bathroom report for this location because ive never been in there long enough to actually go."
3,"In short... great view, really expensive food."
5,"Thank goodness for Sue at Mill Avenue Travel. We contacted Sue to book our honeymoon trip to St. Lucia at one of the Sandals resort.  She was great with setting everything up, booking airfare etc.  When our original airfare decided to cancel the flight, she made sure we had a comparable one booked.  The best thing she did for us was encourage us to purchase travel insurance.   When we arrived at our Miami hotel at 10:30pm the night prior to leaving for St. Lucia, we had discovered Sue had left us an urgent note to contact her.  We found out a hurricane had hit St. Lucia and all of a sudden our honeymoon plans starting crumbling apart.  Because of Sue and our travel insurance (thank goodness we listened to the expert on this one!), we were able to change our honeymoon to a Sandals resort in the Bahamas and didnt miss a beat.  Sue was in constant contact with us, which calmed the craziness I was feeling (and Im sure my new husband was relieved).  The airlines even took care of our baggage fees on the way to the Bahamas.    If we had booked this trip on our own, we would have been up a creek without a paddle.  I most definitely would not have purchased travel insurance and our honeymoon would not have turned out to be the amazing trip it was.  We will definitely be using Sue again."
5,"Truly a hiden gem in Chandler. Located south of Chandler Boulevard, just off of Roosevelt (next to Archery HeadQuarters). Wandas is a small yet quaint, twelve tables inside and 5 outside. Outside is for sure seasonal, as summers are too hot and dead of winter can be too cold. Wait times on a Sunday or Saturday can be 10-15 minutes during the ""rush times"", which is a quarter the wait time you would experiece at the near-by chains. The menu offers a variety to satisfy and hunger (except if you want lunch on weekends, its breakfast all day, lunch from 11-2 during the week). The burritos are awesome. Ladies, I guarantee you will take half home! My husband likes the Biscuits and Gravy. The bacon is amazing and addicting often I have to smack my families hands away from grooping a piece. French toast, cinnamon raisin french toast and pancakes if you brought your sweet tooth =)   Build your omeltes are good too (tip, add a side of salsa, you wont be sorry, it is made fresh daily and goes perfect with a ham and cheese omelete). Service is exceptionally friendly, a lot of regulars and the servers know what you usually drink and sometimes can have your order written unless you throw a curve ball and veer from your usual.  A+ Wanda!"
3,"I tasted my first Qdoba burrito last night. I went with the Queso Steak burrito. The burrito was hearty with lots of meat, rice and beans topped off with pico and some cheese and sour cream. My wife enjoyed her chicken burrito bowl with similar ingredients. Ive had many burritos from taquerias to the burrito chains. Qdoba falls somewhere in the middle. I would gladly take a Qdoba burrito over a Chipotle or Una Mas burrito any day based on my initial experience. The staff was friendly and we were in and out for our take out order within 3-5 minutes."
5,"Ive been hearing about these cheesecakes from my husband and his incessant twitter following and I was really excited to try some of the goods at the market this past Saturday. We finally woke up early enough on a Saturday morning to hit up Matts and then peruse the market before it got too hot.  We made our way over to the cheesecake table and then debated between 10 or so flavors.  He had key lime and chocolate chip out to sample and I decided to try the key lime.  I was amazed at how natural it tasted.  There was nothing artificial about it, it just tasted exactly like it should.  These are very good, very simple cheesecakes.  I ultimately went with the peanut butter chocolate chip which is extremely tasty.  There are a bunch of different sizes to choose from, all at very fair prices.  YUMMY!"
1,"Terrible experience here. They cut up my foot when trying to remove a callus. Also, they told me they used shellac when it was really gelish. Wish I could recommend, but I wouldnt want anyone else to go through the same experience."
4,"Really great burgers...I would hope so with a name like Smashburger. This location is really good, so it gets busy at lunch time. Waiting is a bit of a pain, but its typically not too long. The food takes a few minutes too, which is a positive in my book. The food here feels a lot fresher and better than fast food, though if youve seen their burgers, its not a place thats super healthy. They also offer chicken sandwiches (crispy or grilled), and salads, so there are some healthier options, but the winners here are the burgers and fries. Definitely try the smash fries. Tossed in olive oil, garlic and rosemary, they are delicious. Burgers are really good and juicy, and the ingredients they use seem fresh. Cons are the long lines, and its also not a place where youll be in and out in 15 minutes. Its also not inexpensive. A burger, fries and a drink will run you $10-11, which seems high for ""fast food"", though I think its worth it. Whats nice though, is that you sit down with your number and they bring you your food, and theyll bus your table, so it feels like a combo of fast and full service...I suppose this is a perfect example of ""fast casual"".  Its pretty close to my office, so Ill be back often. Definitely worth a try if youre in the area and craving a burger."
4,"I was fairly surprised to visit Line Thai and find some decently authentic, good-tasting Thai food. Id always assumed that this area of Phoenix was (excuse me for the pun) totally dry on ethnic food, considering I had a hard time finding pho within a ten-mile radius of my parents place in Surprise. Anyways, I chose the pad si yew (spelling varies all over the place, I think they spell it ""phat si iew"") and my father ordered some kind of chicken cashew dish. Both were excellent, though a little more in the line of American tastes -- not as spicy, and the pad si yew wasnt cooked slightly burnt like I recall it traditionally is made -- it was pretty tasty. The hot tea was a great companion to my meal as well. The service was great without being too pushy, invasive, or sloppy. They always refilled my water in a timely manner and didnt interrupt my conversation with my dad. Thats important to me -- that servers dont bust into your conversation with little to no consideration of personal space. My parents had been there several times and enjoyed it, so now I see why they liked it. Oh, and their spring rolls and the accompanying peanut and hot sauces were also delicious -- not the best Ive ever had but super-tasty. The atmosphere is a little dry (what is it with this word? Sorry) but I can live with it. The booths were comfy and its not like the place was musty or gross. Not every good restaurant needs to be chic and trendy, really. All in all, it was a nice experience at a reasonable price and Ill definitely make a visit next time I hang out with the rents."
4,"So I e-mailed East Maryland the same afternoon as my visit, explaining that I was disappointed that the coupon I had given them was not honored, and they e-mailed me back before the end of the day, apologizing and letting me know that my Visa would be credited the amount of the coupon.  Then they called today to see how the boys were all doing after their shots, and acknowledged the bill issue again, and hoped that everything had been settled to my satisfaction. This kind of immediate and friendly follow-up redeemed them and gained them another star."
5,Amazing selection of beers with great tabs educating you on them and often ratings.  Wine and booze selections are great too.  Killer store like candyland for adults.  Prices are excellent and so is service if you need help finding something.  Great place!
1,"Their alcohol slushies are undrinkable and are sure case of gut rot. As far as the place, its pretty small youll probably want to leave after 10 minutes."
5,"This location is quieter than the one at Arizona Mills Mall. No screaming kids in your way. The clothes are less disheveled, still attached to the hanger, but for the same low price. I get my husbands work shirts here for like $8. Ross understands that there are still skinny Americans out there and they carry size 4 pants. YESSSSS! I -3 the unusual house goods you can find at Ross. I redid my whole bathroom and made it into a nice Victorian style in light pink and a wood brown. They had this soft-green painted shelf that looked like a twisted vine. Where else can you find something like that? I found these two toothbrush cups that were painted with butterflies. Worth the $5 each. My bathroom is gorgeous. Youll want to take a crap in there."
4,This weekend was my first time back since they have done the huge remodel and under new ownership. This place still has the same comfort feel to it and is cozy. Havent tried the food yet but enjoyed the drinks and the ambience in the bar. Hopefully the food is better than what it used to be.
4,"This place is great.  A nice little ole fashion homemade ice cream place that looks like it has been there for forever.  The place has a real nice vibe to it.  Sorta reminds me of Sugar Bowl only smaller, not as busy, and easier parking. The menu is ginormous.  I couldnt decide what to get but that didnt matter because the other 3 people I went with chose for me.  I wanted something basic but they insisted on sharing the patte thing.  It is a few scoops of ice cream over a brownie and topped with whip cream and caramel.  While it was very good it just wasnt what I wanted.  Next time Im just going to get a scoop or 2 of the ice cream so I can really taste what the ice cream is all about.  It is just too difficult to tell when it is topped with a bunch of stuff.  The ice cream we got on the brownie though (butter brittle I think) was excellent.  They have tons of different flavors and they all sound delish! Anyway I cant wait to go back if I am ever in the area again and need a sugar rush!"
5,"The hubby and I stayed here on our wedding night. We didnt arrive until midnight or so (we partied late :)) and the service was still impeccable. After our car was valeted and we were golf-carted down to our casita, we were left to enjoy our night of solitude. The room itself was beautiful; king sized bed, fireplace, patio overlooking the golf course, vanity, ipod dock, jetted tub, separate shower, and plush robes and slippers.  We ordered room service probably close to 1 am and it arrived promptly. The boy ordered the veggie wrap (he said it was delish) and I ordered the tossed greens salad with balsamic. For $13 the salad was a total miss. Just a few mediocre lettuce leaves, tomatoes, onions, and cucumbers thrown on a plate. I was hungry though, so it worked. The next morning we slept in as late as we could. I woke up with the worst heartburn (thanks, balsamic!) so I called the front desk for some Tums. No problem, they arrived pronto. We packed up and called for a ride, and although they said they were busy, they arrived shortly after.  I would love to come back here and stay a little longer. The service was great, the place was beautiful, and for the one night we were there it was damn perfect."
5,"girlfriend and i always stop here on our treks to lee lee market.  If you havent tried pho (pronounced fuh) , this is a great spot.  Basically its a beef soup thats a thousand times tastier than campbells.  its served with a plate of crisp and fresh veggies, like bean sprouts, jalapenos, basil, etc,  that you can throw in the soup.   i recommend using the spicy sauce that has roasted garlic in it instead of sriacha.   we also had the lemongrass beef salad which was equally good.  Everything is fresh and tasty with great service.   make sure you take dobson for the easiest entrance as pho ao sen is facing west!"
3,"Enjoy coming here with a group, cooking our own grub and playing in the sand. Evenings in April and May are great, as are September and October. Winters are a bit chilly after sunset, and the summer... well I dont need to explain that one.  No great deals on food or drinks. Service is hit or miss but I come for the company and dont really mind. Order a few pitchers and your grub to cook, then pretend youre at home having a BBQ. No service required!"
4,"-Inexpensive produce. -Fresh sausage and other meats. -$2.99 freshly made to order sanwiches. -Decent prices, cheaper than Whole Foods. -Parking is convenient. -Employees in the produce dept not so friendly.  -Cashiers are usually friendly."
4,"Ive been eagerly awaiting the opening of this place, since its on the way home from work.  I finally got the chance to stop by yesterday. Theyve been open about a week now. They are located on the north west corner of Guadalupe & McClintock, between the pet food store and Panda Express.  Super cute place, has a roll up/fold up door so the whole front of the building can be open, right onto their little patio. You can sit inside or outside!  Tons of different flavors! I tried the Peanut Butter & Jelly & a mint/chocolate one. Both were very tasty. I ended up going with their chocolate yogurt with some peanut butter sauce, a Giradelli chocolate sauce and peanut butter cups. SO GOOD. A decent sized cup cost about $3.30.  The girl who rang me up was super nice, and offered me up little sample cups.  The only suggestion I have is to label the toppings. Yes, most all of them are self-explantory, but a lot of those candy bars look the same all chopped up!  I will be back for sure!"
5,"Had a bad day yesterday and decided my health-conscious lunch would *not* cut it as far as getting me through my work day. Ive always loved VSC & have had their menu at my desk but I hadnt been in a while. Put an order together w/ some co workers & called. I was read to go pick it up, but then they told me THEY DELIVER! I dont believe they did the last time Id been there. Went out on a limb & tried the Dead Head wrap - soooo good and WELL worth the price b/c its huge. I almost took off a star b/c their pasta salad is NOT what it used to be. I dont know if they changed it or if they are just inconsistent in making it, but it was kind of embarrassing that Id told my coworkers how awesome it was just to have it come out not so great."
5,I like their seating area. It has a nice sized inside area and also a bright outside area that is tucked between a walkway and another store. One of my favorite locations.
4,"This place use to be a Wendys for years since I lived down the street. Still, they made it look nice on the inside (they have a drive thru!) and they even had a man playing his versions of classic rock songs on guitar which was nice. The Hostess was also our server and she was super nice (Go Erin!).  When a girlfriend of mine and I walked in we saw the specials for the day and when I saw avocado curry I was sold since Im addicted to avocados. We got the lettce wraps which was good (wish it didnt come with iceburg though) and got it simply because it came with I believe their sweet and sour sauce AND the peanut sauce. LOVE peanut sauce. From what I saw, they had a full bar. Beer selection was good, nothing on tap though which makes me a sad panda. I had to order the thai tea which was very good and tried the thai coffee, also good. Avocoda curry was amazing! Though when I got the bill I was sad to see that it cost $18... I understand that when they say its the special, it means that they dont serve it on their everyday menu. Ill most def be back, very good place! P.S. Came on a Monday night."
5,"Perhaps youve heard of the Library of Congress.  Nice Library. Burton Barr Central Library has a bigger reading room. Wil Bruder was the Architect.  You either love his work, or you hate his work.  I love his work!  And, this library is as good as it gets. Arrive in the sixth floor reading room a little before Noon *on* the Summer Solstice.  Ask a librarian:  Theyll tell you why. [ah, the mystery....]"
3,"I have been through plenty of airports around the world and I have to say that this one is on the better end. It is easy to navigate, clean (from what I have experienced), and makes getting to and returning rental cars a breeze.  As in most airports, those who are not used to recent travel REALLY hold up the security check line. I would think they would want to be prepared and get through that check as quickly as possible and I held my breath when one young lady came back out in search of a 1 quart zip lock bag, fearing that we would have to evacuate the terminal for her breech, but we were all able to make our flights.  A word to pet lovers who insist on traveling with their four-legged friends: allergies and asthma plague a large number of people and difficulty breathing caused by YOUR pet presents an unexpected glitch in their travel day.  PLEASE CONSIDER LEAVING YOUR PETS AT HOME. An unplanned trip to the ER as a result of YOUR inconsideration should be YOUR responsibility. What do you say about that, health care providers???  In all my travels, this has been the only time I have been stuck behind the hairiest cat I have ever seen in my life because its owners had more baggage than humanly possible to manage. Clueless to others distress as the owners, their pet left wheezing, sneezing, itching, gasping travelers in its wake. Are you from Naperville?"
4,"oh man, I gained 5 pounds on Sunday but since it was from Joes I dont even really care - it was that good.  I wont go into the local ingredients, Agritopia, etc since others already have but it is a wonderful thing. More below. The food was awesome. Very fresh, delicious and wholesome - you actually felt like you were eating food that was also good for you. Granted we just had the burgers and ice cream but theres a whole menu there to explore on future visits. I loved the signature burger with pesto & fontina, neither of which I had ever thought of but worked very well. The onion rings were good, as were the milkshakes and sundae. It really fills you up fast though, so try to pace yourself! I was equally enchanted with the setting. Beautiful place. Just like a farm oasis in the midst of suburbia - I hope it doesnt vanish in the midst of the houses all around it. Even the bathroom was noteworthy - clean, black and white with dolls and a closed circuit tv. It reminded me of the Jetsons - you know, the 60s idea of space age.  Sitting outside wasnt too hot, as its the one place Ive seen so far where the misters really work and dont just spray you and puddle down.  The only down side was when I asked where the farm stand was and the cashier pointed it out, but without mentioning it was closed. Nor was there a sign at the actual location indicating when it would be open in the fall. Oh, and what was really nice was the sense of everyone relaxing - just kicking back and having a good time. definitely worth going to again, and again ..."
5,I came here hoping to catch brunch but I guess it ends at 11:30am or 12pm. Luckily the lunch menu looked just as tasty. We ordered the Luau pulled pork sandwich (the jalapeno cole slaw gives it a nice kick) and the Monte Cristo (french toast instead of regular bread slices = delicious). Service was friendly and attentive. The dining area is decorated like a household- very comfortable and clean.
5,"Our waiter was Vincent. Very polite, helpful, accommodating, and knowledgeable about the menu and the taste of each item. Service was A+!  The food was fantastic. No errors, was tasteful, unique, and fresh! I will definitely come here again."
3,"I remember a time when Ikea was an almost legendary place where the angels would sing a greeting to me as I passed through the hallowed doors.  That was a long time ago.  When I was younger (and significantly poorer) Ikea was the one true way I could get semi-stylish home furnishings at a reasonable price. Many a room was filled with fine pre-fab furniture that was always just a wee bit small.  Its funny how ones tastes change. This weekend I ventured forth to Ikea in search of baby stuff. A good friend of mine is with child and wanted to check out what Ikea had to offer.  Walking through the store I saw the same stuff I saw ten years ago, and while I could still see the appeal, I realized that it just wasnt as cool as I remembered. Ah well, at least I still have the memories (and the coffee table, end tables, TV stand and lamps).  Ikea is still great if you have something specifically in mind. My friend found a bunch of excellent decorations for the soon-to-be-born babies room, all for insanely low prices. I bought a few pillows. Yes, this is what my life has become.  Ikea didnt change, I did."
5,"I have been going to Physical Therapy for several weeks working on Plantar Faciatis (ripped tendons in the foot), I was not getting enough massage to make much progress, I switched to Massage N You and they focused on my calves and now we are making good progress on healing.  They had the right touch, pressure and listened to what I needed.   Going back for more..."
4,Located in the W Hotel in Scottsdale.  Great sushi dishes and a great atmosphere.  Ive only been there once but the service was great and the food was very taste and fresh.
4,"My GF says Take me out for a rum drink, I says your wish is my command.  Beautiful little restaurant opens at 5 downtown. A very kind sir welcomes us in. I see the rum punch and I order up. Now this rum punch is delicious but I would have liked it to be stronger, ya know Punch $5. I decided to add a shot to our drinks with a Haitian five star rum.$8.  We also had an app of Cuban style pork tenderloin sandwiches using fried plantains. My Gf enjoyed them I just am not crazy for plantains. Anyway cozy seating and we had a good time."
4,"My husband surprised me with a stay-cation at the Westin Resort for the weekend and we ate here on our first night! Let me just say, I LOVE MUDDLED DRINKS, I am not a fan of cosmos or martinis or anything that just tastes like strong alcohol - BLAH! For me stronger isnt better, flavor and uniqueness is better! This place has by far the best muddled drinks I have ever had! If you just want to go for drinks they have this cute little drink bar right before you enter the restaurant - separate from the main dining which I thought was nice. The decor is romantic latin! I love it!  We started our dinner first by receiving these potato rolls. OMG where have these been my entire life!!!!???!! They are just fall apart in your mouth good! We both ordered mambo mango drinks - STELLAR! We then got the tres ceviches (lobster escabeche / mixto clasico / ruby red tuna) the lobster was the best! But all very good. However the crab empanada was my favorite! YUM! My husband got the jidori chicken and myself the adobo pork. Both were good but not GREAT. Too much seasoning on my pork. To me this place is a MUST go to for drinks and small bites. I would have given this place five stars but the entrees just didnt do it for us. However, it was not horrible - just okay. The rest of our experience with dinner - service, restaurant ambiance, overall feel and all of our food and drinks before the entrees was AMAZING! So we will be back just for a more small bites and drink night!"
4,"What a menu! My boyfriend loves sushi and I dont eat seafood, so going to these types of restaurants can be quite disappointing. However this place has the most extensive menu Ive seen at a Japanese restaurant that is known as a sushi bar. The ambiance in the place is really romantic at night with dim lighting, nice music, and delicate plating. All the little details in the decor, like placing the chopsticks on a polished river rock was beautiful. Their menu offered everything from chicken and beef to lots of seafood. I ordered chicken teriyaki and it was delish. Their sauce tasted homemade and was lighter then most which I loved. It came plated nicely. I also had their tempura which was light and airy as it should be. The dipping sauce, also heavenly. My man seemed to enjoy his sushi and it looked nice as well. Overall its pricey compared to other sushi places, however the ambiance of the restaurant and upscale choices on the menu make it worth it."
2,"Whats up with the premium gas in this state being only 91 grade?  Wheres the 93?  Anyhoo, this is a very busy gas station at the corner of 16th and Highland. When the pumps are full of cars, its hard to maneuver in and around the parking lot. The store looks a bit short on supplies, but then again I just went inside to pay.  I may give it another try, well see.  But Ill look elsewhere first."
4,"I really enjoy Thats A Wrap... all of the food Ive ordered here has been really enjoyable, plus its all a really good value for the money. My favorite wrap here is the Prince of Thai, sin pollo con tofu. The Veggie Bowl is also another good option and Im pleased they can make anything vegetarian. Worth a stop for lunch, however, the parking lot is tight and I have been here more than once when it was full."
4,"I always forget and tell people that Pomeroys is on Central. I think it must just be that cool - Im trying to pull it closer to the other really good places to go. It is, in fact, on 7th St. and if you tie it on a little tight, the grocery behind is, in fact, open late.  It looks like a bar that should have a few regular bar flies and music that screeches to a halt when someone new walks in. And by that, I mean its the most endearingly divey of bars. Theres shuffleboard, just give your id to the bartender in return for the pucks. Theres pool, but you pay quarters for that. The juke box is electronic and you should expect that youre gonna hear Def Leppard at least once during the night. The regulars will help you learn darts, the food is griddle-fare and the guys behind the bar are always good for a chat or to grab you a pint.  Pomeroys should definitely be on your rotation of places to be in Phoenix."
2,"Im usually a big fan of dive bars but wasnt impressed, at all.  One of the kegs was empty so my friends didnt get their ""favorite"" beer, not a huge deal but not a good thing for 5pm on a Friday.  The servers seemed really overwhelmed and was probably due to the fact that there were only 4 for the entire place and it was really busy. On a very positive note, my friends said that the food was really good for bar food. This might be a great place for any day and time other than happy hour on a Friday."
1,"The portions are too small, the plasticware just reminds me of Jack In The Box, the serving tray is right from a mall food court, and the menu selection is drastically reduced.  You cant really enjoy conversation or relax at lunch listening to the kitchen scream out order numbers to the customers.  The flavor mixing softdrink machine is fun, but gimmicky.  The food quality and flavor are the same for the most part, but you do leave wanting more... I wont be returning to this location."
5,"No attitude, efficient lines, clean, well stocked with flat rate boxes and other sundries????? Is this USPS or a dream?  Writing Yelp reviews for post offices seems like... weird, or, something, but it feels so right for this location."
4,"Ive been a baseball fan my whole life, and I have to say that this place hit one out of the park!  We had lunch at St Francis today and were thrilled. There were only two of us so we had a limited sample of the menu, but everything was topnotch.  We tried the baked goat cheese appetizer and were wowed by the creaminess of the melted cheese, the piquant flavor of the tomato salsa, and the crunchy toasted baguette to spread all the goodness on. This is a winner... just go ahead and order it and youll thank me later! Dining partner got the Red Wine Braised Beef sandwich, with the Red Quinoa side salad. Now I must tell you, I was all over quinoa ten or fifteen years ago, before it got real trendy, and cooked it often... but always had it hot, sort of as a substitute for rice in dishes where youd use rice.  Never ran across a recipe for it to be used cold, in a salad... REVELATION!  the dressing and other ingredients in this dish are very cleverly combined, look very nice on the plate, and provide the double whammy of (light and flavorful) with (savory and satisfying)... you could make a lunch out of it and go home happy!  The sandwich was good... grilled bread tasty... horseradish sauce brings zing and flavor... but all in all nothing to write home about.   I ordered the Pork Chile Verde... gosh I seem to order that all over town dont I?  this one is not a home run, its more like a Grand Slam In The Bottom Of The Ninth!  OMG so smoky good, with a healthy heat index (comes with a roasted jalapeno in the stew, eat at your own risk)  A side of homemade corn bread is delicious, crumbly and just goes perfectly with the stew.  Dont be shy, just dip it in there and get it all over your upper lip... no one will blame you. I definitely will return to this restaurant, perhaps at dinnertime... but whatever time you go, I am sure youll enjoy it!"
5,We live by and love this place! Happy hour is most def the biggest bang for your buck! Try the shrimp boil but only if you like your shrimp a little spicy!
2,"This place was so bad on so many levels Im not even sure where to begin. Our server kept calling me honey.. and seemed to be in such a hurry she wouldnt stop and listen to me. You know how needy I can get and need to be listened too and heard. We started by ordering the Baked Spinach and Artichoke Dip..  what I couldnt understand is 1, how did the chef let this go out and 2, no one but us could smell the scorched burnt smoke coming off the dish. This thing was so badly burned and scorched it was completely inedible. Sent it back and she didnt even offer to bring another one. Perhaps it was because they were so busy they just wanted the food to go out? So I ordered their Famous BBQ Ribs.. I hate complaining to much but these were old ribs.. maybe maybe a day or 2 before.. pork takes on a funky taste when its fridged for to long.. the texture of the meat (when you could find any) was like jerky. I happily ate my Creamed Spinach (2 star yummy) and didnt eat more then 2 bones of the ribs. When the waitress came to clear the plates (she never checked on us) she asked if I was full. I told her that the ribs werent to my liking.. she smiled and asked if I wanted dessert.  Over all I would never come back to Don and Charlies.. aside from the  Creamed Spinach, which I can make myself, there werent many redeeming qualities. A shame too because its so close to the house. I dont get it because the Yelps are so good. Maybe they were having  a bad night? It was so bad I wouldnt ever go back to find out."
5,"Very good place to eat.. I go here atleast 3 times a week and the owners are very good people, they always interact with their customers. I pretty much know the owners and everytime I go there they already know what I want. I highly recommend this place."
4,Only a Mexican food snob would undrmine such a great Traditional restaurant (and believe me we have plenty of those here in Arizona). This is old school Mexican food folks and its about as good as it gets. The atmosphere is classic and I personally enjoyed it but it is not upscale  but then again Mexican food normally isnt. Its simple and thats what Arribas is. If Arribas were located in any Eastern state it would easily be the best in the entire state. The beans were great the salsa was delicious and the service was fast.
5,"Since I have ranted recently on poor customer service, and in the spirit of balance, here is a shining example of how easy it really is. Late last summer  I came home and was shocked to see two of my sunscreens looking quite vandalized. Upon further inspection, it appeared that while using a back mounted leaf blower, one of the landscape crew had brushed against them. The exhaust pipe must have ripped and burned the screen material as well. It was quite the nasty burned melted scar.  After staring at it for several hours, I realized there was no virgin Mary, no Jesus, hell it just looked like burned grilled cheese without any deity or lesser apparitions whatsoever, regardless of the angle or my squint. So deciding there was no money to made on eBay, I set out to get them repaired. Did some online searching and decided to call AmeriZona. I explained the situation and was told they could repair them, but I would have to bring them in. These are some pretty large sun screens mind you and packing them into the convertible would have been a challenge. While pondering what to do the person helping me on the phone asked me if I could hold on. I could tell it was one of those thinking on your feet light bulb went off type can you hold requests. She came back on the phone, informed me that she had a crew that was working close by and that she would ask one of the crew to swing by and pick up the screens for repair. She could not promise when they would be repaired, but for that convenience alone I was on board. She had already quoted me the price to repair the screens, and it was very reasonable considering some other online comparisons. Someone showed up within a few hours to pick up the screens. He could not have been more accommodating, and it was obvious this guy had been working all day and was on his way home.  A few days later, Mark  phoned me to tell me my screens were ready and to tell me he was going to drop them off on his way home! Needless to say Mark was also very pleasant to deal with. I believe he was at the time the sales manager.  When he arrived, the screens looked great, matched the color of the others, even with the sun bleaching over several years. He even offered to put them in!  This experience was way beyond any customer service expectations. No extra charges for any of the above and beyond the call of duty efforts. Outstanding, and quite refreshing."
4,"Stayed here for a friends wedding and it was excellent.  The rooms are expensive, but they have been redone.  This hotel was built in the 80s and the grounds are above par.  They have a 3 level pool with a bar in the middle.  Works for me!  The golf course is  really nice. The staff is excellent and the rooms were really nice.  Make sure to use your Starwood Guest Number. If you like cactus, stay here."
4,"Whats better than some refreshing, authentic Italian ice on a 115 degree day? Not much. Good variety of flavors, friendly owners, and a nice space. Enough said."
3,"I like the way they treat my dogs, really friendly staff.  They are really good about getting your pet seen in an emergency.  The facility itself is nice.  However, it feels as if they are always trying to sell me something things I dont need. This place is so expensive, we can never get out of there for less than $100."
5,"As a sissy vegetarian, I feel compelled to mention the soup that no one has yet mentioned at Da Vang - THE TAMARIND BASED SOUP HOT POT IS AMAZING! I dont know if they use any other animal broth in it, because I am willfully ignorant of such matters.  Regardless, if you are a meat eater or a vegetarian, try the tamarind soup, and bring friends.  It is super yummy. They also have a rice-based soup.  And, if you talk to your server, they can likely recommend some vegetarian/tofu based dishes that will be wonderful. Everything else is as good as everyone says it is.  Wouldnt be surprised if people got an occasional bowl of sub-par pho; every family restaurant makes mistakes.  Id recommend everyone try it again."
5,"What a wonderful restaurant. I cant believe each dish is 475 calories or less and the portions are still a good size. No sauces, no bread, no fries. The fish tacos were delicious, succulent, with just the right amount of spiciness. The grilled, boneless rainbow trout was fantastic. The pane seared, sushi-grade Ahi Tuna salad was to die for. And leave room for dessert....yes dessert. Only $2.50 but arrives in a shot glass size bowl. just enough to stave off the sugar craving. The decor is elegant and sophisticated. Great for an executive power lunch or a date to impress. menu changes 4 times a year and features local, fresh, in season food. Very inventive menu starting mainly around $9 (flatbreads and sandwiches) to $16 for lunch. Wait staff is knowledgeable and attentive. Great food, great atmosphere, great for your waist line. But even if youre not a calorie counter this still ranks right up there for the food quality, taste and presentation."
5,Steak cooked to perfection.
5,"Best chocolate ever!  I tried Leonidas for the first time in Europe and have been looking for it ever since in AZ.  Im so surprised they opened a store here, would recommend it in a heartbeat.  Also, staff was very friendly, a great place to get gifts!  I just got an assortment of chocolates and was very happy with my choices. The banana creme was surprisingly good and so was the champagne flavored..."
4,"I was looking for a place where I could get new tires and an oil change that was near home.  Luckily there is an Advanced Auto Service and Tire Center south of Old Town Scottsdale on Thomas Rd.  I initially went in for two new tires, but ended up getting four new tires since all tires were the original ones from when I bought the car.  Fortunately, I am getting a $80 rebate on the tires which is a good thing considering the cost of the Goodyear tires. It took about 90 minutes to get the four new tires installed in addition to an oil change.  I worked with Jason and he provided excellent customer service from inspecting my tires to recommending the best tires."
5,"Went here for a work function today. What can I say, this place is awesome! A great variety of meats all cooked to perfection. My favorite was the bacon wrapped filet, yum! Nice salad bar with good variety as well, instead of bacon bits, they have a bowl full of uncrumbled bacon. Lastly a slice of cheesecake with strawberries, mmm. Simply awesome stuff! Taking the wife when I can."
5,"I used to work here so it had to be good;) Honestly, I would say it is the most friendly place I had been to. Cashiers are willing to except all coupons and work with their customers. The prices are great and the gas rewards system is very useful. I just wish it was a Marketplace instead."
2,"Possibly the creepiest convenience store I have ever been to.  I mean, its sandwiched between a strip mall and a giant dirt lot."
5,Sara (bartender) is the hottest chick in the world!!
4,"Truly dont appreciate the pathetic TEASE they have by naming this place with initials, yet refusing to tell us what they actually mean.  If there isnt a clear meaning, then youre lame for having a name like this.  Please, drop the act. They dont brew their own beers as of now.  Theyre contracted out by someone else (Grand Canyon I think, which doesnt have a good reputation for award winning beers). Large tap selection, but sadly it is heavily skewed heavily towards Arizona beers which are not exactly highly rated, nor sought after by those really into great craft beer.  Luckily they still have some of the better regional beers from California & Colorado (among others) on tap as well. Food is extremely high in price, excluding happy hour.  Maybe theyll do better than the failed German places in this location before it."
3,"We went on a Sunday afternoon, the wait was 45 mins for 4 people. We waited because everyone keeps talking about it. Man, was I starving to death when we were seated. I had the ham and cheese omelet and everyone shared an order of waffle with everyone else. The omelet was good. The waffles were light and fluffy. Good but not to die for. I personally think it was over hyped. It is good breakfast food, not GREAT."
5,"Excellent pizza, great service, family environment in a beautiful setting.  That sounds like a tagline on a website, but its legit.  The diavola and the salsiccia are my faves.  Just amazingly tasty, simple, pizza with quality ingredients made the right way in a brick oven.  Pizzeria Bianco might have em by an inch just based on pizza alone, but if you dont want to wait 2.5 hours for a pie, Cibo is the place to be, and almost as good.  And although Bianco has a 2.5 hour wait whereupon i generally drink wine for the duration(which might be part of the reason the pie is so good), the limoncello at Cibo generally floors me just as well in a quarter of the time.."
4,"I am always in search of good food fast...not fast food! I think Jimmy Johns knows what they are doing, and should continue to knock out those sandwiches, FAST. I love that I can pretty much know, I will a) Not wait in line and b) be in and out in 2 to 5 minutes flat! Heck yeah! And get a very tasty filling sub. I recommend the Lulu, it is very good, and has tons of meat. Oh, dont waste your hard earned money on the Avocado. This is my only complaint about Jimmy Johns, they have pureed avocado and just spread it on like it is mayo, only they dont put much on. I think it is a waste of money. This is my go to lunch place when I am in a hurry!"
5,"Great customer service, nice owner. The broth here is actually the best ive tasted in Arizona."
3,"If you dont want to read the whole review, Ill sum it up in one sentence -- Via Delosantos only uses yellow cheese. I went here about 4 years ago for a celebratory occasion, and was afraid to eat the food based on the smell of old grease and the look of the entrees on tables around. We ate on the patio, which is directly on Central Avenue, and after the horrid smell of grease & exhaust pipes, I couldnt wait to flee the scene. Last year, I was unknowingly led back to this same place.  Years had passed, and I had completely forgotten about my vow to never return. This time, I was pleased. It probably helps that upon entering my expectations were very low. I immediately was attracted to the kitschy Mexican artwork, their vast tequila collection on display, and of course, the christmas lights. The salsa seemed fresh and was just the right amount of spice. They keep the chips & salsa flowing so be careful not to fill up.  The margaritas are really sweet, but theyre cheap and will get the job done. This is the kind of place where you stick to basics. Dont get fancy or try and order something healthy.  Get a chimichanga, burrito,  shrimp enchiladas, or a chile relleno, and if its appropriate, get that sucker enchilada style. Be sure to have your Tums handy when done if you think you can eat a whole plate by yourself. The portions are huge and totally splitable.  Oh, last word of advice, dont get the guacamole. Its super gringo, and has a ton of sour cream in it. Im giving this place 3 stars b/c its a good value if youre sharing, they ambiance is very comfortable & amusing, and the service is very accommodating."
4,"I love this arena...maybe I am biased since I am a diehard Suns fan and a downtown resident, but it really is a nice facility.  The Suns games are always well put together...great announcer, great dancers, great entertainment, and great concessions. I attended the last game of the season in a suite Wednesday night and was impressed with the space and the food...actually quite good!"
4,Amazing food and I prefer the atmosphere at this location.
4,"I lived in Phx for 7 years and never heard about this place, but having to come back for a friends baby shower, I needed to find a good hotel. This place was surprisingly awesome, considering its right next to Old Town.  Walking up to the rooms part from the outside/back is not very impressive, they kind of look kind of like converted apartments. But inside is contemporary looking, little older, but still nice. The landscaping is awesome.  Beds are really comfy, the kind you sink into. Which is a huge plus for me, since im expecting and my stomach is pretty uncomfortable at the moment.  No dated tube TVs, yay! We had an LG LCD, and the channel selection was decent, they were all in analog though. I was worried about noise since this is right next to obnoxious Old Town, but it was really quiet. The only noise we had was a neighbors dog deciding to bark at like midnight... (They are pet friendly and provide beds, bowls and walks for dogs) All the rooms have patios so, if its not bloody hot its nice to sit outside in the morning, listen to the birds, and people watch.  Our room came with a bucketobeer deal as well that we didnt use, esp since I cant drink. It was all crappy domestics of the bartenders choice.  The only complaint I have about it was that the pool was packed most of the day.. We went back to the pool around 10:30pm to relax and there was still 5-6 children playing in the pool and the spa. What little kids are doing awake and at the pool at like 11pm, I dont know. Those are some responsible parents...  But for $92 a night and all the stuff they include with it, its definitely worth it."
5,I think everyone has said most everything that needs to be said about this place. But Ill highlight the reasons I frequent Switch... free wi-fi good drinks $5 recession plate special - that is always as awesome as the rest of their menu good happy hour specials open til 11pm 7 days a week good wine  great/friendly wait staff their salads are out of control - amazing. i think i could happily support/invest in switch/fez/ticoz dynasty for all of eternity...if i had the means.
4,"Solid options for fast casual mexican fare.  Where else in a landlocked area like Scottsdale will you find a quality fish taco.  I definitely prefer this place over Baja Fresh, Chipotle, or any of the other usual suspects."
5,"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!  I have tried several of their subs and although they are all delicious the Chipolte Cheese Steak (its the # 43) is my favorite!  It is the MOST DELICIOUS sub I have ever had!!!  The bread is always soft and fresh, it is extremely filling because its stuffed full of steak, peppers, and cheese!!!!  To make it absolutely the BEST sub ever have them add some of the little red chilis to it (I think they call it chili relish)....OMG!!!!!"
4,"The food here was great! Wish there was more indoor seating, but the seating both indoor and outside is nice, live music sometimes, nice decor.  Ive tried a few of the specialty drinks, some are good some are so/so but isnt it always that way? Just preferences.  The prices are a bit high, but the portions are worth it, we can split a meal typically.  The Deserts are awesome too!"
4,"What Whattt! Hip hop videos blaring as I get my strike on? Bowling specials after 9pm? Friendly staff? Cheap drink specials from the bar in plastic cups? ASU and working class stiffs co-existing one sweaty bowling shoe at a time? Teenagers making out at the arcarde section? Loooveeee you, Brunswick!"
3,"Really like this place, wound up there one night by accident, as my friend  and I got disgusted with the lousy service at the ""other"" bar in the same shopping center as Tonys. The place had a good vibe, jukebox playing, people shooting darts,  we felt totally comfortable, and found a table, to sit and catch up.  Service was really good, The bartender, while waiting on another customer, made eye contact, to acknowledge me, and said shed be right with me.  I like that in a place, ---nothing worse than standing at a bar waiting to order drinks and feeling invisiable. My beer was good and cold,  my friend ordered a vodka and orange juice, and commented that it was a nice ""stiff drink"" -   We both said we were glad we stumbled upon Tonys and will be back."
2,"Maybe its just me but this store is not up to par in my opinion. I always stop here to get money orders for rent on the way home from work and I almost always have to wait at the counter for 5 or more minutes while employees constantly yell ""someone will be right with you"" at me from all directions. The sandwich counter is good although it says sandwich in 3 minutes or its free and it always takes longer. (I never say anything because I dont care, I just dont see the point of the sign.) Their meat section is a joke lacking any real selection. The produce is almost always below my quality standards and is also lacking in selection. Last but most definitely not least they always have just one register open and no self checkout. Overall going there is a highly inconveniencing experience and I would not recommend going there for anything."
1,"The parking is my beef with this place.  Why does a customer have to pay $12 for each time we park at the garage?  If you move in and out three times, thats $36 for parking.  Yes, my company was paying, but this was just outright stupid and I wouldnt make my company pay for this again. Ive been to Phoenix twice since then, and Ive avoided this place and stayed at the Marriot.  Much better place."
1,"DO NOT GO HERE.  One of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had.  The setup is a little like ""Pei Wei"" where they take your order, give you a number, and bring the food to your table.  Placed our order, and had to stalk other tables and hover over people eating trying to wait to get a table.  Waited a long time, all the while others who ordered after us found seats and got their food before us. Servers kept bringing my food to me since it was ready, but I still didnt have a table, so they kept saying they would ""put it under the heat lamp"" for me.  Finally eventually found a table, and then kept waiting and waiting for our food, which the manager claimed ""he had them remake"" since it was getting cold.  My food came, and it was cold and disgusting.  We had to get going since we were going to a show, and my moms food still wasnt there.  The staff asked to see her receipt, since they couldnt find her order.  She went up to the manager and said she just wanted her money back since we had to go (it had been 45 minutes since we placed our order).  He said her food would not be ready for a while, and gave her some cash, and we left.  My mom never even ate, and my food was horrible.  I would NOT recommend this place, its awful."
5,"Great pecan apple pancakes!  Superb decaf coffee.  Servers and counter staff are bright and smiling.  Restaurant was clean.  I have already recommended it to another foodie. IF you park in the public lot, just west of the restaurant on 3rd street and eat within 60 minutes, it is free of charge to park."
3,"Picazzos is not very big and was filling up fast by the time we left. There is indoor seating, outdoor seating and a bar area. No exciting decor. Looks just like your standard Italian eatery. This place prides itself on  its organic and local ingredients. Which is great, but the price definitely reflects this.  According to our server, both the regular crust and marinara sauce are 100% dairy free, so I did a create-your-own pizzza with veggies and non-dairy cheese (I believe they use Daiya). The pizza was good, but not amazing. I like a lot of Daiya on my pizza, so when I go again Ill definitely ask for extra. Also, I ordered spinach on my pizza and I felt that the spinach wasnt fully cooked, just a little wilted. I like my spinach fully cooked because I feel that adds more flavor, but thats a personal preference. Our drinks took a while to come out, and for what we ended up paying we didnt get a heck of a lot. Ill definitely be coming back soon and see if I cant get them to veganize one of their specialty pizzas."
1,"This was the most HORRIBLE floor cleaning I have ever seen!!!!! We took before and after pictures and cannot tell the difference at all! The guy was not friendly and just wanted our money even though he did not do his job! I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone. We paid $1000 and got $20 worth of service. I mopped the floor the day after the cleaning guy was here and got a lot of the ""staining as he would say"" off easily. I have included a picture that we wrote in the floor with a paper towel after the cleaning....can you read the saying? That is exctaly how we felt after the service. REALLY?!?!?"
4,"Very pleasant hip restaurant. Try as many Bruchetta options as you can; each order comes with 4 pieces (potentially 4 different toppings), and all the ones I got were delicious: Brie & Apples with Fig Spread, Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, and Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil."
3,"Im going to have to work through this review before I decide on 3 or 4 stars. Ive been thinking about this since my visit and I cannot seem to come to a conclusion. Another one of those times I wish we had half star options. The Parlor is definitely The Vigs little baby sister. It Aesthetically looks extremely similar, it has both the same Scottsdale-esque vibe and crowd, both are in weird, out-of-the way locations, and both are really loud.  Even for a new restaurant with lots of buzz on a Saturday night, I thought this place was crowded. There was over a 45-minute wait for two of us, so we ended up grabbing a beer at the bar. Im glad we did because our bar tender was smokin hot. Nothing better for the self esteem of two broken-hearted girls than a cute, flirty bartender.  After a while we just decided to eat at the bar and skip the whole table idea. Good choice, even though the bar area was REALLY loud.  On to the food... we started out with the cheezy cauliflower appetizer. OH MY GOOD LORD. It was amazing. It was topped with bread crumbs and baked... it was just absolutely amazing. It was good later as a midnight snack and good as breakfast the next morning.  For dinner we shared a Pesto and a Margharita pizza. I loved both of them, but the Margharita had more flavor and I preferred it over the Pesto. Both had great quality ingredients and were extremely tasty. Im pretty stoked that the prices are so reasonable. Two hours, five beers, an appetizer and two pizzas later, we ended up with a bill for $50 plus tip. My solo bar tabs are normally higher than that! My major complaint, though, was the whole entire time I was there I had a stuffed nose. I dont know if it was an allergy to something they were cooking, the wood, flowers, etc but I could barely breathe. The second we stepped outside it was like I had a new nose. Man.. I still dont know... three ... four... three ... four... okay .. my decision is made: if the 6 tall snobettes coming into the bathroom as we were walking out didnt smash rudely into my dining partner and act like she was Antichrist for trying to inhabit the same place at the same time, I would definitely go with a 4 but its a 3 for now until things settle down a bit."
4,"We live in the neighborhood so were excited to see a new place with a huge range of beers open up. The decorations are a bit sparse, but we like to sit on the patio or the conversation areas near the bar, which are perfect this time of year. Yucca chips are personal favorites, as is the gnocchi bolognese. Burger wasnt bad, but a burger is just a burger. Theyre still adjusting their menu it seems, which I expect any place to do for the first few weeks as they settle in. I really love their commitment to craft beer, especially Arizona beers. $5 pitchers of AZ beer before 5:00 is not only quite a tasty offering, but appeals to my love of all things local. Give OHSO a try!"
4,"Prolly one of the best and definetly one of the better Chinese places in town. they deliver pretty late which is always convienent and have the best house fried rice, wonton soup, beef lo mein, and their honey walnut shrimp is average. The white rice tends to be a bit dry, but overall they have always been pretty nice, and always throw in free crab puffs for free when you order over a certain amount. Definetly the go to place for fair priced, yummy Chinese food!"
4,"I have used The Parking Spot twice now, and am a registered card carrying member...lol. I have coworkers who use one of the other economy places across the street, but they dont get covered parking and I dont remember them being offered a complimentary news paper on entry and nice cool water when leaving. I get a government discount with ID and you can usually find a coupon online. Not to mention the prompt pick up. They are behind my vehicle ready for me and my luggage even before I am out of my car. There have been times when we wait for a few more people before we go to the airport, but never more than 10 or so min. I love not having to weave my way through the airport construction or get lost or delayed trying to park at the airport.  When getting picked up the most I have had to wait was about 20 min. And as I was about ready to call, they showed up. Dont loose your ticket. I have seen others who have and it makes it really tough. You can pretty much expect to be the drivers last drop off, unless you remember where it is or see your car as others are getting dropped off.  The entrance is just W. of 40th St. and can only be accessed when heading W. bound on Washington due to the light rail. But the website has some good directions as well."
5,"Wedge salad is delish! Love the fact that its organic, as well as the fact that the pizza dough is gluten-free...sure beats having my husband sneeze for an hour, after eating ""regular"" pizza. I will say, the pizza is pretty good...and this is coming from a girl from Chicago!"
4,AMAZING!  This is the first time I ever got what I ordered!!!!!  140 degree grande peppermint latte!  WOWZA!  YIPPEE!  Though the staff did not seemed thrilled to be there or had any sort of personality-it didnt matter because my drink was perfect:)  FYI-this was the location outside of the B security check-point.
3,"I had very high expectations for The Breakfast Joynt because so many gave it 5 stars, which means ""As good as it gets, Woohoo!"" according to Yelp.  My experience didnt live up to that but Im willing to give them another try. This location was formerly a bar that was transformed into a breakfast restaurant.  The actual bar is still there, with a flat panel TV in the middle, but surprisingly the shelves are still empty all the way up to the ceiling.  Theyve only been there around 6 months, so maybe this will change as they settle into the location.  It has a very clean, upscale feel to it - something not out of place in North Scottsdale.  Its also easy to find once youre off the 101 onto Raintree, and then north on Northsight... its on the right and shares parking with Golds Gym that is easily seen from the road. I found the eggs to be good, and recommend steering towards the omelet choices.  Being from the South, it wasnt thrilling that the biscuits were somewhat small and square shaped, almost like a little dinner roll.  They have their own style (and theyve informed me that they are homemade) but I was looking for something more substantial to be smothered in sausage gravy.  The pancakes were not served hot with the other food items, and they seemed to have settled and were somewhat chewy and elastic. Menu was rather straightforward and clear with sectioned boxes, with a nice highlight of their featured stuffed apple pancake.  I thought the description of ""ham that falls off the bone"" was repeated far too many times. Prices were very reasonable for Scottsdale.  The fresh squeezed orange juice was excellent.  Owners are very concerned about customers with less than a stellar dining experience, so Ill be sure to give the Breakfast Joynt another try with friends and family."
4,"I didnt eat here, so I guess I cant give a full review. But I did have a beer, and I did take the Orbit to downtown Tempe, and I walked over here and had a yummy pint for 2 bucks on Sunday evening.  The more places that I can drink then take a bus home, the better."
4,"Went on a recommendation from my brother...I owe him a beer or something!  Great, great food.  The bbq is the best Ive had anywhere, hands down.  The prices are great.   We tried all of their sides while there (Group of 5, and you get 2 sides with each meal, so we did it on purpose).  The potato salad was pretty disappointing, and is the only thing holding me back from 5 stars.  The rest were delicious.  DO not miss out on the BBQ beans or the mac & cheese (I know, ""mac and cheese--really?"") YES.  Little bits of their smoked bacon mixed in makes it so, so good. Sweet potato fries were really, really good as well. I did not try the waffle fries, but my husband liked them & he is a waffle fry snob. Had the pulled pork, spicy sausage, beef brisket, ribs...all of it delicious.  They have a wide variety of sauces you get to pick out & add yourself, or just eat the meat straight up. My 12 year old daughter said that ""the food tastes like the air smells when you go camping"" (she was referring to that delicious smokey flavor...it was cute to me). The place is small, but I dont blame them for that--you have to be able to establish yourself in this economy or youll go under.  Hopefully they will be able to expand someday.  Driving out from Mesa wont be easy!!"
3,"Was in the area for a grad school interview and the BF was craving some red meat. Came here based on yelp reviews, left pretty full, content about the food.  Service was friendly enough, but we had some trouble communicating what we wanted. We settled on the kalbi, bulgogi and the ribeye? steak meats, with an order of the tofu soup. Everything was a-okay but I think the only thing that stood out was the ribeye. Normally we like to cook the meat ourselves but since we didnt want to stink on our plane ride back to cali, we decided to let them do it for us. Side dishes were standard with the different pickled veggies, kimchi, potato salad, etc. Waiters were pretty prompt in bringing out replacement side dishes for us.    Since we dont know the area very well, the stars are good service, being open at odd hours (I think we got there at 4pm?) clean restaurant, decent food. -2 stars for small portions and no real wow factor."
5,"One of my fave restaurants! The unlimited salad is a winner. Its delicious! They also have a gluten-free selection that my brother loves!  For Christmas, they also have some gift card deals."
4,Mojo made me fall in love with fro yo. I love Mojos Twitter Tuesdays where you can get half off of your fro yo. The location is awesome; I can go to Mojo between classes. Its here where I found my love of the pomegranate & acai flavors as well. They have awesome seasonal flavors as well as the other usual staples. I love their different toppings and its a good place to hang out with friends and get your Mojo on :)
5,"Matts was absolutely fantastic. Got there at 2pm on a Sunday, which is apparently the time to do it (half an hour before close), as we walked right in, sat right down, and had food in 5 minutes or less. Brilliant. I had the Five Spot which was simply the best egg sandwich I have ever had. Two eggs, two huge slices of perfectly cooked bacon, american cheese (my favorite with eggs when Im not going fancy-style, reminds me of when I was a kid), and well grilled onions round it out, served on a fantastic roll.  By default, this item doesnt include the normal potatoes and toast, so I had them add homefries--they were magnificent, and entirely unnecessary. A huge portion of them, with a wonderful smattering of rosemary to punch them up, they were delicious, but I couldnt finish them. The girlfriend got a waffle with bacon and it should just be said that restaurants who serve waffles without real maple syrup are simply criminal. Matts brings the good stuff, and its MUCH appreciated. Perfect for dipping both waffle and bacon alike. The waffle was fluffy, light, and had that good, homemade flavor. I cant get over how filling and delicious my sandwich was. Service was prompt and friendly, and overall, it was a great experience. Added a glass of OJ and a coffee to my sandwich with added homefries and her bacon and waffles bringing our tab to right about $21. Absolutely worth every penny. Will be coming back. Probably near 2 oclock again, to avoid the wait!"
2,"I used to go all the time when I was in HS and last trip I noticed some change over of the stores from what I remember. The food court has okay variety, but not a whole lot. I think that the management company neglected this place for too long, it definitely needs its facelift. Its great for its convenience if you need to pick something up real quick but I wouldnt be spending all day there."
5,"Doesnt get better than this, the guys at the Chandler Mall location do it right, every time!"
2,"What kind of sports bar doesnt serve SLIDERS??? Nachos, quesadillas, and celery/carrots options but NO SLIDERS??? Guess that just goes hand-in-hand with the NO MALIBU RUM option!! At least the bartender asked me if their fake option was okay first. Hello... no!!!!  Wait service was crap after a spring training game as they did not have nearly enough staff to serve people. Had to wait 15 minutes in a booth before anyone acknowledged us. BUZZ KILL!!  On the plus side, patio is pretty cool and the pool tables when its not a busy time!"
4,"Both of the previous reviewers are correct, actually. Yes, there can be a line to the door at times, and not everyone working there is 100% nice 100% of the time. But who is? And, once you get to know them -- and are courageous enough to give them the benefit of the doubt -- everyone working there is very cool to deal with. Because this Post Office is tucked way back in the Foothills, its not staffed as heavily as Ive seen some others. But the remoteness of the location also means you get to breeze in and out on rare occasions too (seeing as this is too far out of the way for any non-Foothills residents). So, do like me: never go here in a hurry; be polite; be patient (its not all about you). And youll see this is really no worse than any other Post Office...and maybe even a little bit better."
5,"The shaved ice at Bahama Bucks reminds us of vacationing in Hawaii! Lots of flavoring options, and a cheap date!  Havent tried the smoothies yet, but we heard theyre great!"
4,"So. . . I think the name is very misleading. I have thought about stopping in before, but I also thought this place was a deli counter with the usual sandwiches and a little ice cream. I would have been surprised.  My sister talked me into trying it out for a quick bite before our Thursday night class.  This place is like a neighborhood pub should be.  The wood bar is warm and inviting. The Side Door is small - very small.  Even though this is obviously a neighborhood joint, we didnt feel uncomfortable grabbing a table. For every 70-something that was at a table, there was  a 20-something at the bar. The food was not amazing but it was decent and reasonably priced.  We split a Greek salad and a roasted veggie pizza.  The veggies were great, the crust, nothing to write home about, but could repeat.  I want to come back and try some of the sandwiches.  Somehow I have a feeling the Italian beef would be a hit. . ."
5,"After a long week of being trapped in a conference room, I really really needed to be outside.  Pinnacle Peak helped to put me back in my normal happy place. This spot is very popular and can get really crowded on weekends.  I wanted to enjoy a little bit of solitude, so I arrived as the sun was rising.  Good choice - there were only a few others around on this chilly morning. The 3+ mile trail is an out-and-back route, with enough ups and downs to keep it interesting.  Like a stairmaster, but better because you arent in a gym squished next to some icky sweaty person.  The well-maintained path is packed gravel, so you can spend more time enjoying the beautiful views rather focusing on where you are stepping. For those that want to take their time and learn a little, there are small signs along the route that label various plants, as well as two rest points with markers to tell you the names of the mountains you can see in the distance.   Get up!  Go outside!  You will love it as much as I do."
2,"Food was tolerable, and tasteless.  The chips were actually tostadas that were extremely hard (almost stale) when eating. The entrees we ordered were bland.  The rice and beans had no flavor at all.  Maybe that is Baja style of food, but couldnt find the flavor anywhere. The service was great and the ambiance was wonderful, but I dont think well be going to this place again."
3,"Dear Yelp: Why cant there be a 3.5 star rating?  I wanted to give this place 4 stars, but will have to wait for another visit to bump it up. I have never been here before, so I consulted with my fellow Yelpers for their input.   The service was quick and prompt.  Our waitress was friendly and on top of things.  I was impressed by the selection of beer, although small, with an offering of Alaskan Amber Ale...mmmm. We decided to keep things simple this trip.  12 wings, medium flavor, one large margherita pizza with garlic on 1/2.   GOODS: I LOVE the mozzarella that they use!  I have never tasted cheese this cheesy or this good on my pizza.  NO JOKE.  The wing sauce was also delicious and they provided you with a perfect amount of sauce to cover the wings.  AND, the ranch was NOT watered down, which I am traditionally used to. BADS:  The parking lot sucks.  We had to park across the street from their main lot to find a spot.  Also, the tomatoes on the pizza were unripe.  Our pizza was soggy in the center, perhaps from the tomato juice during the cooking process, and it made for bad leftovers in the microwave the next day. So, with the combination of the both, I will definitely say that I shall return to give them another sampling in due time, and perhaps bump up that star to where I think it should be in the back of my mind."
1,"We used to go to this UPS store quite frequently and had been satisfied with their service, but it has been at least a year since we regularly patronized the place.  However, we had a really unprofessional experience here recently.  We went there for rotary services for purchase of home which one employee refused to do and handed off to another employee (because as she under her breath, notary services were a pain).  This employee could not help us either as ""he had never seen anything like it, and he didnt know  want to  have anything to do with something that had power of attorney on it.""  I guess we are one of the first people around here to sell a home. While we waited for this man to do something, the employee who handed off our paperwork, tried and failed to scan a document to email and was quite verbal and (sorry) hickish about these ""stupid"" machines.  After looking at all was going on, we didnt want anyone here handling our notary services.  Eek - felt like we dodged a bullet.  Also, dont think I will be going there for any other services.  I felt like my IQ dropped 20 points when I went in there."
3,"They have on campus night classes for MBA students, which works out well for people looking to continue their education.  Some teachers care, others just use it for the pay check.  The accounting classes have been great, some of the others have been terrible.  There is a ton of counselor turnover, but they put too much stress on those people for the amount of work they do.  If your employer will pay for it, an MBA on the resume can help a bit.  At least they are quick to provide information on their programs and admissions process, unlike ASU who just want you to pay the application fee."
4,I can only comment on two of the smoothies because I am on a banana kick and I choose from one of the two: the Bananrama or the Peanut Butter Chocolate. Oh so good! And now they do offer more than one size!  I have started getting this for dinner versus food! I love it!
5,"Excellent in every way.  Attentive and fun owners who tend bar every weekend night - GREAT live music, excellent wine selection.   Keeping Fountain Hills young.... one weekend at a time."
2,"Normally, love this store & have been a member for decades, but was very disappointed with the woman who ""helped"" us last Saturday in Womens Clothes. She has horrible customer service skills. Told us that, since there werent any listed on the website, ALL REIs were sold out of a parka Id tried on 2 days prior at their store. You mean to tell me that your location sold 10 North Face womens parkas in 48 hours when its 80 degrees outside??? This was after shes told us theyd just shipped all their winter stuff to Denver the previous day. Never offered to call the other store & ask them to hold a jacket for me. Instead, she claimed all REIs were sold out of the black jackets b/c the website only showed blue & squid red. I explained that the website hadnt shown black inventory on the same day Id tried on the coat at their store (according to her, it should have shown up on the website inventory) She still claimed all stores were sold out. Never mind, I bought it online from one of your competitors and it was cheaper too."
5,"Last night we met friends at Hillstones and we truly enjoyed a great meal and great atmosphere.   We were met by a very friendly and helpful server who took great care of us the entire evening.  We started out with a wonderful wine recommended by our server, she let us taste 3 kinds before we chose what suited us.  We went on to enjoy the savory spinach and artichoke dip as well as fresh baked bread served with some olives and olive oil.  The caeser salad was a very large portion almost could have been my entree and the dressing was so fresh and light.  The croutons crisp and fresh baked.  We all ordered the hawaiian ribeye, OMG!! So moist and so juicy - the flavor was so fabulous and I could only eat half of it.  The loaded baked potato was also wonderful and very large.  I ended up taking half my meal home and was really happy that they let us sit quite awhile to chat with our friends after our meal was over (we were way too full for dessert however the server brought us a complimentary slice of key lime pie which my husband and friends said were fabulous I just was too full to try it) we never were rushed out and they kept refilling our drinks I cant wait to go back.  Was always a fan of Houstons in NYC and this was very much the same and enjoyed the jazzy low music in the background and the dim lighting that was warm and relaxing."
4,"Yumm yumm yumm!   The burgers are fantastic and yummy! The service has always been top notch, fast and freindly. Love the inside and outside environment.    Could do without the TVs with sports playing on them...dont we get enough plugged in entertainment in our lives already?....but Im probably in the minority. Kid friendly for those well behaved kids of course. :)"
4,"This is in a really cute part of Chandler.  Ive driven by a million times, but never paid attention to the all the restaurants.  We went here for lunch based on the great reviews it received on Yelp.   I cant really add much more to the other reviews, but just wanted to be one more person to say that the food is delicious & service was excellent.  Great ambiance & music too!"
1,this is a business located in the frys grocery strip mall on mckellips and recker I wont say much but dont bother the waitless girl was about as pleasent as a hemroid the beer selection sucked. I belive the owner was there at least the guy looked like the owner. its always amazing to me how the service can be so horrible w/owner in house.
3,This place is consistant with its good Chinese food. The staff is courteous the place is clean. Want Chinese take out in Tolleson come here. =0)
5,"My boyfriends company has been doing business with this PostNet store for the last 4 years. Service is friendly, prompt and helpful. I highly recommend it."
5,"This hidden gem is located just outside of Mill Ave and is apparently the hipster home base of Tempe. If somehow you are allowed in without suspenders or nonprescription clear glasses, you will see exactly what goes on. to the left at least four people playing chess, to the right someone reading a book, but sitting next to someone writing a book, and did someone just walk in with a puppy? Yes. As you walk up to the counter you are already disoriented so you may be confused about what to order. Well, they are known for their cappuccinos, which I can personally vouch for but on a hot summer day in Arizona, I recommend their ""Dirty Horchata"" or ""Espresso Excellente"" a rice milk horchata with shots of espresso. It was good for the minute it lasted. See you there next time."
5,"I actually love this place and I always get great service when Im there. The tootsie roll is by far my favorite.  I must say, however, that I recommend the Sakana on Power over the one on Elliot... for some reason, I like the sushi over there better...?"
5,On my little trip around the city I drove over to Sweet Pea. Very cute store and great personable staff. Nice selection to baked goods and great taste. What nice find in the downtown area. Ive got Wicked Bakery up north and Sweet Pea downtown... North and South is covered for those sudden cravings... now time to find something on the on West and East sides of the city.
4,"I moved to AZ a few months ago from NYC, where I lived in a neighborhood of great Vietnamese restaurants, and have eaten my way through the Vietnamese enclaves in Boston and in Hong Kong -- and this place ranks up there with the best of them. You can tell how authentic a Viet place is by the condiments when you order: the right kind of basil, mint leaves, and limes. This place has all that correct, and their fish sauce is perfectly seasoned: not too sweet like some faux-Viet places, and just the correct color/taste. Im lucky that its down the block from my new home, and I can run in whenever I want. The pho is right-on, with really tasty and rich broth, and I also love the noodle cakes with grilled beef.  Only complaint is that I find the price to  be slightly higher than what Im used to in NYC (of all places!). But its only about $1-3 off per entree, and I understand it may cost more to get their supplies to the desert."
1,"This place has NO clue when it comes to pricing mens items, and I would not recommend them at all.  I consigned a leather briefcase worth close to $600, and they priced it for $90, giving me a whopping take-home of $40.  I understand the need to move merchandise quickly (and naturally, this sold in a matter of days), but cannot fathom why they would not attempt to get more money for the item.  I can only assume they did not do their research before setting the price.  Consigner beware!"
3,"The Good: We absolutely love their wings and its becoming a regular for us to go every other Tuesday for their wing deal. We always get the honey hot wings and share a side of either regular fries or the loaded fries. The Bad: I do feel the wings are a bit too pricey, even on the deal days. Also, what is up with their high school hostesses!? They are incredibly rude and give dirty looks every single time we have gone, which is now around 7 times. Someone really needs to put these girls in check. Goodness. This is the reason for 3 stars instead of 4. I would actually give it 3.5 stars if I could. We like the atmosphere and it always seems clean and the servers have been very nice so far."
4,"Ive practiced yoga for years at At One Yoga and initially wasnt happy about their merger with LifePower. But now, after several months of going to LifePower, I think its pretty nice.  The facility is big and clean and very well kept. If you want to use the entire facility (the weights and machines) you have to sign up for a monthly contract. However, if you just want to take the yoga classes, you can buy them packages of ten classes. The ten classes can be used over any length of time. I like that because if Im out of town or busy, my class package doesnt expire. I do wish they offered more class packages, like in groups of 25 or 50 classes, the the way At One Yoga used to do. Because typically the more classes you buy, the bigger the discount.  The great majority of the yoga instructors from At One Yoga have come over to teach at LifePower. Ive taken yoga classes in several places throughout the US and I think these yoga teachers are among the best in the country."
1,"It is what you would expect from any themed place called ""Heart Attack Grill"".  Mirrors on the bottom part of the bar so you can see up the skimpy outfits the ""nurses"" wear at the bar.  Van in the drive through section is painted to look like an Ambulance.  Hamburgers are named after cardiac events. The food was bad, greasy unlimited fries and a giant hamburger that tasted as if they mixed in filler of some kind we had never experienced before. If you plan on going, enjoy the experience cause the food will not be something you would head back for again."
4,"Dont let the ol door-in-the wall/lack of window effect scare you! The Tally Ho does a fine, fine job of balancing that delicate mix of neighborhood watering hole/hipster hangout. The drinks are strong, the bar staff are friendly and everyones in a good mood at this little dive bar. The music (stocked with a multitude of genre) is always on but not so loud that it interferes with conversation. There are a couple of pool tables, beer in a bottle and the drinks are served up just as ya ask for em. Cant go wrong with this place if youre looking for a quiet, entertaining hangout to throw a few back. Between the red vinyl and HUGE bar, I heart for Tally ho."
4,"Im on a Outback kick.  I cant help it.  We ended up here one evening by chance and I love their steak and loaded mashed potato.  The service is good, the food is good, its not too crowded.  Like I say, Im on a kick."
4,"If you need something obscure, or you need to get everything you need in one place, then here you go.  I also love how many different 1 shot mini bottles BevMo has to choose from."
5,"Yes, before you ask, I still love Desert Stages Theatre, perhaps more than ever.  This is Andrews fifth play there and this time he plays the Knave in Alice in Wonderland. Normally, we dont ask for a specific role but the director of Annie Jr. thought he would be cute as the Dormouse as he popped up from the table so thats what we asked for this time during audition. And we anxiously waited for the casting to be posted.  When the casting was posted, he did not get the requested part and as a mom and a parent, I was glad. Why you may ask?  Because to me as a mom and a parent, its very important to teach my son the importance of handling success with graciousness and moving through disappointments with a positive attitude.  When he asked why he didnt get the part, I told him in simple words that the director had a vision of what the whole play should be like and she saw Andrew in the role of Knave and that was his special role.  I also told him that it doesnt matter what role you get, if you play it with all you got and go out there and perform with your heart as there are no small parts, you will capture the audiences attention and that will be your moment. He listened with a typical 5 year old attitude and became very excited about being the Knave.  And I was also excited for him because this time around, he had 2 long lines to memorize and speak! With each review, Ive written about how Andrew has grown through DST and here Ive included a video where you can see him growing aware of theatre and performance:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsG07sMlZ5s&feature=related.  This time around, he started asking me if he was a main character, starting to understand the structure of a performance.  It was great to see his awareness growing.  I highly recommend bringing your own child to audition for a play here.   It will be an amazing experience!! Really, DST is about the kids.  Trusting the kids to do their part and giving them responsibilities.  Once the curtain lifts, the kids are responsible for THEIR performance and for each other.  Its fantastic to see the kids have their moments on stage, being responsible for moving and arranging the set, take care of the tech, go from loose energy backstage to fanstatic actors on stage.  Its all fabulous. If you have doubts of what kids can do, go to a show at Desert Stages Theatre and be amazed.  Truly, if you believe in your kids, as DST shows again and again, your kids will shine and raise above your expectations!"
1,"OK. So I think that this may be the first business that gets one star from me.  I just flew home from Israel on this airlines.  Boy, they are pretty sad.  I usually dont like to be too harsh on anyone, but this airlines deserves it.   Please, dont think of this review as complaining, but rather a warning to others out there to never fly US airways (Nobody likes a complainer right? Haha.).  Well, not never, but if you have no other choice.  I would venture to guess that this airlines is pretty cheap because of the full flight loads that i encountered.  You could say that is good for them but the service on the planes was not up to par.  I guess I have been spoiled with the likes of Hawaiian Airlines, Nippon airlines, shoot, you can even throw Delta in there.  The flight attendants are rude. This is from both personal experience and from observation of my own.   You know what, I could go on and on, but I really dont like to cry about stuff.  Would I fly US Airways again? No way.  If it was one of the last airlines on Earth?  Maybe.  I just hope that their service of customers get better.   Then again, maybe they didnt treat me well for the fact that I hadnt shaved and looked Talibanish.  Oops."
5,"One of the things I love about my neighborhood is that Cornish Pasty is w/in walking distance. Every pasty Ive had here is awesome. My personal faves include the shepherds pie, the chicken pot pie, and the thanksgiving pasty. Yes its tiny and loud, but it adds to the charm. Also, the smell that you smell right when you walk in the door= heaven. We eat in and get to go. Tip for to go: have a beer or a cider w/ your wait."
1,"Ok..I told Amanda that anyplace that serves beer would have a tough time getting less than 2 stars from me...I wish there were 1.5 however.  As covered by Amanda this bar is about as straight as they come..this bar personified would probably call bars with any hippness at all the bad F word for gay folk. In fact this bar would most certainly over-use that word.  Does Puddle of Mudd, Disturbed and POD know that their songs are available in karaoke form? Do they make money from them? Who was the first person to say damn man I can not wait to scream this song to the MIDI music only version over some beers this weekend. I had a good time...but I tend to make the best of things. There was far more facial hair than head hair. I hate phonetic spellings.. Oh lord dont ever make me go back. ...eff it...I changed my mind. 1.2 stars and I am rounding down."
5,"My boss took us here for a little Holiday lunch the other day and i have been dreaming about the burger ever since! Seriously, the term ""cheeseburger"" doesnt even to justice to the masterpiece they brought me! And the parmesan and truffle oil fries were amazing, too! The decor is kind of cool, sort of an American Teddy Roosevelt feel... Grand old pictures, deer head, and dark wood mixed with high ceilings and light colors so it doesnt feel all heavy. Ok, back to the food...  The burger has applewood smoked bacon and grilled onions mixed into the patty. It is incredibly juicy without being greasy! They top it with Havarti cheese, place it on a buttered grilled brioche bun, and serve it with a couple of different sauces... One was like a garlic butter type of sauce and the other was like a horseradish mayo. I ate every single bite and didnt care that i was stuffed to the gills or looked like a pig in front of my co-workers! To leave any bit of that on the plate would have been a travesty!  I cant wait to take hubby here for lunch (dinner would be wayyyyyyy too expensive)."
4,"Im from California and every time I visit Arizona I have to make a stop here. The ambiance is very nice and classy and located in a great/fun area. The bar and drinks are great and the food is fantastic. Like i said, Im from California and live in the Bay Area, so I thought I knew what great seafood was - wrong! Who knew that the desert had better (well almost better) seafood than San Francisco or Monterey Bay?   I had the Vanilla Battered Sole with Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese - Amazing! Never tasted anything like that - I recommend that this place be the first stop to anybody looking for a fun night out."
5,"I could spend hours in this place. In fact, I know I have. There are so many things to look at and its way more than just books. They have a ton of cards and stationary as well as fun trinkets. If youre into used books, this is the place to go. Ive found nearly mint condition vintage books here and theyve made the perfect gifts. The people who work here are great as well. Theyre more than willing to help and offer good recommendations. This is a go to if youre looking for a good read or just want to pop in and explore."
4,"This studio is probably the best hot yoga studio I have been to. I went there several times a week for about a month over the summer and enjoyed it every time. I love the music they play and I love that the teachers are knowledgeable and motivational. I really got a great workout while going. The space is clean and even smells good....thats pretty awesome for a hot yoga studio. I like that they have wood floors...it makes me feel like they can keep it cleaner and its easier to balance on. The reason why I knocked it to 4 stars is because it is simply unaffordable. I have a fairly good job, but I dont think I could afford to keep going. If this place was reasonably priced, it would definitely get 5 stars from me."
3,"Im happy to report these cows gave their best for me to eat. Thank you dear moo cows thank you! These burgers are meaty goodness. Recently I went to a lunch with my bf, her sis and Ma on the fly for her b/day since her first choice failed to be open on a Sunday afternoon..... Not her fault their site said they would be open. Bastards shaking my fist in the air didnt update the site.  D O U B L E Grrrrr! I suggested Zin since we were in the proximity.  So this is my 3rd time at this place. While pricey the portions of everything are large in charge & good. The ingredients are fresh, the meat juicy and the fries are crispy as they should be in my opinion. Note to your mother! Do not waste the fat & gym time on the creme brulee shake. Its nothing more then a fancy name on a regular old vanilla shake. Having said that... I am a creme brulee fan so that may have been its downfall. I was expecting greatness and fireworks etc. I got a really good vanilla shake though dont get me wrong but name it a vanilla shake. Dont market it as a creme brulee shake. How to improve it and bring a tear to my eye? Put a creme brulee hat on it. Gimmie the crunchy, sweet Im looking for expect and demand. Just put something on it to give it with that brulee feel or name it a vanilla shake. The best way to explain my feelings would be to say it was like setting up a date with someone on-line and having them show up and its clear they are photogenic but possibly altered a bit and not the hottie in the pics on their profile. It is some one with a great personality and decent looks for sure just not the hottie. Still had a good time but my expectations were something else totally. The banana cream pie shake is de-lish and the Zin burger a def go. If you want a healthy choice go for the Tuna also very good and served perfectly rare. Mmmmm mmmm good."
1,Wont be going there again. Our chicken was pink! Manager was a prick in regards to that and service was all around crappy.
3,"This is a fun place.  It is a great place for a fast, cheap meal.  Is it truly authentic?  It is probably closer to being authentic to many places around the country. Wagamama-like?  Perhaps.  If you know how to order you will do okay here.  A great addition to restaurants in Tempe!"
2,"Eh.... 2.5 stars, maybe? 3? Not sure, yet. After looking at the menu online, I really wanted to like this place. The menu has some creativity to it, unlike the template-North-Indian-restaurant-menus you find at many of the Indian restaurants in the Valley. Aside from offering things like korma, kadai, vindaloo, etc. with a variety of options (chicken, lamb, paneer, shrimp or fish for each) they also have some other more unusual choices, like one of my favorite dishes, mattar malai methi (creamy fenugreek and peas). And dahi vada in the appetizers... I couldnt wait to check it out. Unfortunately, three friends and I went at lunchtime on a Saturday - and there was a buffet. So I didnt get to try any of those tempting dishes. The restaurant itself, while  decorated a little haphazardly (Chinese paintings?) is bright and clean. Theres a TV on a wall, which happened to be playing one of my favorite Bollywood movies...so I was still excited about the place. But...after tasting the food...meh. The buffet was all right.. but nothing to write home about. Pluses? Once again, it had something different..fish curry as well as an Indian-style Chinese dish or two. So that was cool. But the food was just so-so. I was there fwith three other people - one of them said the cuts of meat, especially the chicken, were of higher quality than most Indian buffets. But he didnt like the sauces so much. One other friend said he liked the tikka masala, but that was about it. As for the vegetarians, well, we didnt have a lot of choices. Veggie manchurian (which was pretty good), a very bland chana masala and some pea/carrot thing that reminded me more of baby food than anything else. The dessert was just all right, too. And the rice was very bland. So, overall, I wasnt impressed. But I dont want to judge the place too harshly based just on the buffet. After all, Curry House was packed on a Saturday afternoon, so Im thinking maybe its got something better to offer me.. Ill have to go back for dinner and see what their non-buffet selections taste like before I totally write this place off my list."
5,Best Thai food!!!  Order the dry garlic chicken.
3,"Its pretty clean little place good tacos enchiladas and tostadas but not big on the chilie beef really lacked any flavor.  Like another yelper said, they need a big menu board.  If I was near by I may or may not stop by, Id prefer Some Burros for this type of venue ."
1,"I was there on a Friday night with a few friends in the hopes of a quick drink and nosh after a show next door. My companion and I ordered basic drinks and were met with shots of liquor in the bottoms of our glasses and a blank look from the waitress when I asked if they were out of mixers.  After this, we opted not to order any food (taking our cue from the inability to mix gin with tonic water) and were met with an outrageous bill (for our two well shots).  We questioned the tally and were met with a second total that wasnt much better.   Our credit card was charged twice: $40 for some wet ice and a lemon wedge.  There are many cool and artsy places in Phx where we can catch live music and nosh with friends.  Ill pass this one up from now on."
2,"Coworker and I met for lunch this afternoon.  Restaurant was understandably busy and there was a delay in the delivery of our food. When my pear omelet with potatoes arrived, it brought mixed reactions. The omelet itself was served hot, and loaded with bacon and cheese.  The potatoes served alongside were STILL FROZEN in the middle.   We were unable to catch the attention of the hectic servers to get this corrected. When I brought my plate to the bartender, he poked the potatoes with his fingers, and then asked me if it would be OK if he kept the same omelet, but ""throw some fresh potatoes"" on the plate.  The server said that, if the kitchen had to remake the omelet, there could be a long delay.  I could only respond with a shrug. He left and went to the kitchen with my plate. Several other people touched and poked the plate and potatoes before replacing them.  He then brought the plate back to me at the bar, and not my table.  End result - good omelet, mediocre potatoes, below-poor service and follow-up."
2,"Not very impressed.  Burger was ok, fries Looked great, but mushy Try Smashburger!!  Sooo much better"
4,This location is clean and efficient.  Our waitress was awesome and had our order in and food out VERY quickly.  The food is all fantastic and of good quality.
3,"We stayed for three nights while visiting family for the holidays. Good: Very comfortable bed Clean Funky/cool decor which is unique Very friendly and helpful staff Fair price Great location Not so good: Pricey overnight parking that was a surprise upon check in No coffee maker in room; this is pretty well standard for most hotels. We had to either go to the lobby for $4.50 per cup or drive off site.  On our final morning before leaving (2 1/2 hours before checkout) with our do not disturb sign duly mounted on the outside of our door, we were disturbed by a rap-rap-rap-rap of who I assume was the cleaner. WTF!"
5,"We have been eating here for years. I am as picky of a new yorker as they get (with food). I will say we do not eat there Monday or Tuesdays, The cook must be different, its not as good on those days. The rest of the week is 5 stars all the way.Great sesame chicken,fried rice, lo mien etc. Highly suggest."
4,"dillys has to be one of my favorite sandwich shops of all time. they have such a wide variety of choices that anyone who comes can pick something to suit their taste buds.  i always go for the blazin buffalo because i eat wing sauce on nearly everything. boars head meats on all their sandwiches which is great but jacks the price up quit a bit. a sandwich, drink, and a side was about $10. i went with the pasta salad as a side, which was nothing special, your average run of the mill pasta salad. my sandwich on this particular visit was lacking a sufficient amount of buffalo sauce and i neglected to ask for extra before i left, assuming that they wouldnt be stingy with it. the bread is good, they toast it so it tends to get soggy if you take it to go. the bread bowls are good too, ive had the clam chowder and chicken noodle and i recommend both. service here is usually quite slow. even when its not busy in there, like today around 2, i had to wait 10 minutes to get my sandwich and even saw some guy who was two people behind me get his order before me. when its busy, youre going to be waiting even longer. they need to pick up the pace."
5,"I had the pleasure of living across the street from this treasure for about 6 years. Im still lucky enough to work close by.   Let me be clear. I m reviewing Haji Baba as a GROCERY STORE first.  Then I will give you some insight into the prepared food for take-out or in-store dining. This is one of the few stores in Arizona where you have several choices for pita bread--its also the ONLY place Ive found for whole wheat pita. There are several choices for Feta cheese. Danish, French,Greek...same with olives--there are choices. I ALWAYS buy my tahini here. All the prices are very inexpensive. Need spices???  They have them all.  At about 25% of the price you would pay anywhere else. The best way to describe Haji Baba is that it is a REAL grocery store, with REAL prices, for REAL people.  It is NOT a ""specialty store"" with trendy items and inflated prices.  They sell food items that you will actually use.  The bonus here?  You wont find a 10 year old can or jar of something. On to the ""restaurant"" portion.  Haji Baba is better if you think of it as a take-out joint that happens to have places to sit and eat.  They do have tables and they do perform table service, its just got zero charm.  You go for the food, thats it. Okay, food.  The lamb tongue sandwich is to die for.  Let me repeat.  The LAMB TONGUE PITA SANDWICH.  GET IT!  Their baba ganouj is also darned tootin tasty.  Actually, I sometimes dream about their baba ganouj. Im not crazy about their hummus, maybe because making hummus takes 5 minutes and mine is bomb? But its not bad. Gyros are good and not greasy. Greasy gyro meat is a pet peeve of mine. Chicken shwarma?  Yup, thats good too. Im sure Ive had something  to eat  here that I was a little disappointed in, but I honestly cant remember what, or when ."
2,"Nice atmosphere inside and out, with competent service.  BUT: The food is not great.  Its very dull.  It reminds me of the food they serve at Chevys but significantly more expensive.  I really have no desire to go back.  Scottsdale and any attempt at Ethnic food just doesnt mix. Edit: Thanks to Yelp, Ive discovered just a few places in Scottsdale with good ethnic food.  So now I really dont have any excuse to settle for Blue Adobe."
5,"Four Peaks serves up some great beers and great eats.  This is no secret so no matter which day out of the year or which hour and minute out of the day you go you will see a full patio, and a populated bar.  Plan accordingly.  Try their Italian beer bread, the Carne Adovada, or the Southwest burger and wash it down with a pint of Hop Knot or Kilt Lifter.  You will be happy you did.  All of Four Peaks menu items are appropriately priced and you will always leave satisfied."
3,"The hole in the rock was pretty interesting, but only for about 5 minutes. Its not a hike at all, more of a walk on unpaved ground. Once youre up there, the view is pretty cool, but the crowds of people and rowdy kids and dogs detract from the magnificence and romance. Id think its a great place to take kids, though, because of how easy it is. Good thing its located in Papago Park so you can go and see the zoo or the gardens or Hunts Tomb while youre there. If you go just to see the hole, its kind of a waste of time."
4,"I have now played Longbow three times (twice in 2009, and once in 2010).  I do have to say its a fine course for all tastes. I cant say its a 5 star course, because it doesnt have quite the scenery and/or elevation changes that some that are nearer to the mountains have.  But it has enough interesting holes to make it a unique experience. Its not a gimmicky course by any means.  The course is more or less flat, with enough mounding on the fairways and around the greens to make it challenging.  One major advantage this course has is that there are not any houses on the course.  This means you dont have to worry about breaking anything if you like to slice the ball; the worst that can happen is that you lose your ball in the desert. I also really like the fast greens.  These greens are among the fastest and the truest Ive played, and its really a delight to putt on them. This is a great course for a cheap afternoon round during the summer.  For $40, you are probably better off going a few miles down the road to Las Sendas, but sometimes in the afternoon rates can be had for under $30."
1,"Music was loud as shit.  The food, Jesus Christ the food.  Lame ass chips and salsa.  No joke, like 8 chips were on the plate.  Salsa was probably one of the worst Ive had, no flavor at all and warm.   Salads come out warm (Im assuming this is why Ive been puking).  Gross right, warm lettuce.  Waiter lets us know they can make daughter a little quesadilla (cheese only) which comes out so greasy.  Our taco plates come out 10 minutes later.  2 dinky tacos on each plate that are flavorless and luke warm at best.  Yes, they are spicey, no that does not mean they are flavorful.  Im literally using my cell phone to see what was on the plate its so dark.  Mint water was warm.  Gross and not refreshing whatsoever.  My daughters quesadilla was $13, yes for 2 tortillas smaller than my hand and some cheese.  I get it- make a dollar, but damn, dont rip your customers off.  So over the top lame.  Neither my husband nor myself finished.   Meal was $46.  Horrible.  Health department should go temp that place- Im not sure the refrigeration is working properly.  Such a disappointment, Ive been a vegetarian for 18 years- was looking forward to a new spot.  Wont be returning.  Ever."
5,"Found this place through Yelp and a Yelping buddy so there you have it...the power of Yelp because we absolutely LOVED this place.  Tucked into a neighborhood you have a very cozy, eclectic little joint.  From the start to the end we received extremely friendly service. We of course tried the foods suggested in previous reviews and by the server.  The pasta fries were unique, light and paired with great tasting sauces.  A definite dish you have to try.  We also tried the figs stuffed with chorizo.  Also very good & savory.  But the ABSOLUTE FAVORITE of the night were the chicken and waffles!  My gosh is this the dish to come to the Tuck Shop for.  The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.  The waffles were served with a butter that seemed to be whipped with possibly honey and the syrup was just the right sweet.  All the flavors seemed to work with just the right amount of sweet and savory.  The grilled fresh green beans were the perfect side.  I think I would get this dish over and over and over again.  Then I would go back and get it again.   Great place we will frequent often.   P.S. They make their own tonic.  Yep, their own tonic.  GREAT tasting!  Try it with the vodka they serve (havent heard of it before but was very pleased)."
2,"My first visit was roughly two weeks ago when I got a Mediterranean pizza over lunch.  Service was friendly and prompt and the whole meal cost ~$4. Today, I stood around waiting for help for about 5 minutes without anyone so much as saying hi.  One employee looked at me several times but ultimately went back to stocking shelves each time.  I could see people in the back and the general manager talking on his cell phone.  I decided to ultimately leave rather than waste any more time.  Disappointing at best."
4,"Its hard for me to rate this place because its a little run down.. but the groomers are amazing, so for Groomers- 5 Star, for actual facility-3 Star.  Ive used Janice for awhile now when she was at Fidos on Bell Road and followed her to this location.   The location is right next to Subway and is a hole in the wall by all means!  They have two groomers from what I can tell, Jennifer is the other one and my bfs dog has been groomed by her and she did a great job too.     Why did I follow my groomer to this new place?  Well 1. Fidos Closed and 2. So many places just shave the dogs down, but Janice really takes the time to get to know what you want and takes good notes so when you come back she knows exactally what to do.   If you are in the market for a new groomer I highly recommend making an appt with them just dont be shocked by the location!"
5,The democratic party of Arizona consists of a nice group of  people. I visited their office several years ago with some questions and they were quite helpful.
2,"Ive been to Barrio twice now.  Simply put, I do not believe that it is worth the prices that they charge. The first time I went there was with the pseudo boyfriend and he adored his meal, and so I embraced it and loved it.  The second time was last night for Dottsys birthday dinner.   Dottsy and I ordered up the guacamole that everyone raves about.  We were unimpressed, as we had huge chunks of avocado in there and have both made our own guacamole and didnt see what the big fuss was about.   Ive had the enchiladas suizas and enchiladas de hongas and although they werent bad- they were not amazing.  Not worth the 16 bucks, at all.  Dont get me wrong, I wouldnt complain about the cost if it tasted like it was worth it, but not so much. Because it was Dottsys birthday, they brought her a complimentary flan which we both agreed was pretty tasty flan.  So, if you are a flan person, this may be a place to check out.  I am not a flan person- too jiggly (which makes me think of what fat looks like on a persons body which stops me from eating it). The two things that make this place worth going for are the margaritas and the service.  The margaritas are 50% tequila and fabulous- I usually just stick to the house margarita and am satisfied.  The people that work at Barrio are friendly and cool.  I imagine that they all enjoy working there. I dont really ever need to go back to Barrio, unless Im craving a serious margarita served up by a cute hipster.  Id go for a drink or two and then go elsewhere for dinner."
4,"A classic hole in the wall mexican restaurant and a Phoenix icon. Known best for their machaca and their hot, freshly made flour tortillas. Good food at great prices. For a photo of the best chimichanga in Phoenix and a full review, check out my blog post: http://blog.phosyzzle.com/carolinas"
4,"Surprise!  A Vietnamese restaurant in Surprise.  I ordered bun noodles with beef/lemongrass to go.  I waited at the bar, and the service was great.  The owner sat next to me and had a plate of spring rolls.  I made a comment on how tasty they looked, and he asked if I wanted one.  I think thats when I knew I loved this place.  Anyhow, I got home and tasted my food.  Awesome.  The noodles were cooked perfectly (not soggy), and there were plenty of veggies and meat.  The nuoc mam had a lot of flavor as well. (You can have really good food, but if you have crappy nuoc mam, your food wont taste right.)  I think Im gonna have to start ordering to-go weekly."
5,"They have a new and improved menu and added more Korean dishes. Very good!!! Ive been there 4 times since they added the new menu, and its been good every time. Very authentic Korean food. This is my favorite spot now!!  The dishes I had so far: Champong, Bulgogi, Sul-lung-tang, Neng-myun, Galbi, Yukgejang. All were very good. I cant wait to go back and try other food! Neng-myun (cold noodle) was especially good on muggy hot summer days."
4,"love their food, great for lunch and breakfast.... the service is a little hit or miss but they always keep your coffee cup full-you will almost always have to ask for extra milk-but whatever. Love having the breakfast sandwich or their pancakes-my favorite ones are no longer on the menu though :( they had apples, sour cream and honey over them SO GOOD! Not a place for breakfast cocktails though, so dont anticipate a good bloody mary.   their sandwiches are amazing, Ive had several and have never been disappointed.  Despite the shoty service its a great spot for breakfast or lunch so definitely give it a try."
5,Was looking for a nice dinner place in Peoria to send my mom and step-dad for a birthday celebration.  The people at Flemings were wonderful.  They took my request over the phone and made sure they had a lovely evening.  Mom raved about the service and the photos she sent made the food look fantastic!
4,"Brand spankin new...customer service with a smile. Good selection, good prices, friendly customer service. Bought some stuff to make the house better - garage door opener, some hooks to finally hang that darn 65 x 78 painting up... Nothing at all like Home Depot, either. I found the fixtures for kitchen improvements here to be of higher quality as well. Thumbs up from me...plus, its so close to the house - not sure if thats a good or a bad thing. Time will tell."
3,"Awesome location, cool place....the Chopped Salad is by far the most amazing salad I have ever had in my life (but way...and I mean way to small)...If it were double the portion for the price I would probably visit more. I had a flight when I was there...it took forever (as I know flights are supposed to)...but this was ridiculous...the buffalo meat is so gross...it reminds me of when a stray dog visits my lawn... The BBQ sauce is good....the staff is just OK. Nothing mind blowing. I think staff in a place with a pricey menu should spoil the guests a bit...Give away a free desert when you know the service and meal is just OK...this may bring your customer base back to visit just because you redeemed yourself at the end. Overall its a cool place. It fits with the downtown Scottsdale lifestyle. But stay away from the buffalo, because it will give doggy bag a whole new meaning...."
4,"The shopping center this Rack is located in is absolute poison to my pocketbook. TJ Maxx, Ross and Nordstrom Rack all in a tidy row? Rock on!  There are great deals to be found here with patient and selective hunting like any other discount retailer, and that these great deals are on brands which Nordstroms carries makes any awesome deal so very much sweeter.  Dont go expecting to strike gold at every visit, or expecting Ross prices on Guess shoes, and you will fall in love with the store."
5,"The Westin Kierland is a beautiful resort located in PHOENIX, not Scottsdale.  Some close friends of mine from Canada stayed in this PHOENIX resort for a few days, so Ive hung out in its rooms and generally lounged about the property. The rooms were impressive, beautifully decorated, and spacious. We especially enjoyed taking the kids out to small fire pits maintained on the grounds, where guests to our fine city of PHOENIX can roast marshmallows.  The Kierland has some tough competition, considering that the city of PHOENIX has every one of the most famous resorts in the Valley, from the Biltmore, to the Phoenician to the Royal Palms. It does pretty well in a tough line-up. No offense to Scottsdale, which also has some great resorts such as the Four Seasons. Its just that the most famous ones are in PHOENIX. [For further information, please visit: http://phoenix.gov/BNDMAPS/index.html]"
4,Be sure to save up for the $3000 coffee machine they demod for me! Nuts! I could never imagine paying as much for a coffee machine as I would for a used car! I am really wanting to take one of the cooking classes they offer here. Soon maybe... Hoping for a Sur Le Table Groupon!
3,"Ive eaten at quite a few Yogis Grills since they started opening up in Arizona a handful of years ago. Their teriyaki chicken is pretty good and you get quite a bit for your dollar.  However!!! Two things. 1. No matter which location I go to the service always seems sub-par. It seems everyone that works at Yogis Grill just seems uninterested and lacks the ability to be friendly. *shrug* Its not overly bothersome to me but it would be nice to have friendlier service. 2. Their sushi, is not that good and they are ridiculously over priced. I can go to Kona Grill which is a nice restaurant and get much better tasting sushi for nearly $2.00 cheaper! I just cant get past how expensive their rolls are AND it doesnt taste much better then grocery store sushi.  Ill still go there for teriyaki but not for sushi, its just not worth it."
4,"Sprouts is great, they have a wonderful selection of fruits and veggies and their sausage is made in house and really wonderful on the grill!  The grab and go meals are perfect for a quick dinner and the sandwiches and soups are spot on for lunch.  Very friendly and helpful staff."
5,"One of my new favorite lounges to go to with the girls.   1. I am a HUGE champagne fan 2. You can smoke on the patio 3. the drinks are great and 4. I LOVED the decor and atmosphere.  My friend and I were at Salt next door for a friends birthday party on a Friday night and decided to sneak next door for a drink to check it out.  The staff as a whole were awesome, everyone was very polite and sweet.  It has that chic feel with all the servers wearing cute corsets and dresses.  The DJ was great as well, fun music that kept the energy level up without making it too clubby and easy to still cary a conversation. Definitely a great new place to sit back and lounge in a place with a fun atmosphere and good service. Yay!"
4,"Eaten here a few times (7th street-Coronado district). I can say the place is small but has a cozy feel to it. Its an old converted house to restaurant.  The food is a little pricey considering the portions are not huge (like Filibertos or Carolinas (Extra Yummy). But the food was decent.  Ive eaten the Vampiro, Carne Asada Burrito, Chips n Guac/Salsa, and Americas corn (yummy!!). My eyes are always bigger than my stomach :).  I will say that the last time I did get the corn, it was a little under-cooked. So it was a little harder to chew...but regardless, it was still good. Smothered with mayo, butter, and cojita cheese I think...how can you go wrong with all of that yummy-ness!! I would visit this place again, if I am down in that area. They also allow you to order online which I think is cool because that line gets very long very quick."
3,"I visited Carlys for a weekday lunch when I was downtown for work. Here is the rundown: 1) parking is horrid - common downtown, so take the lightrail (the stop is on Central and Roosevelt) or bring a fist full of quarters for the meter 2) it is crowded! well it was when I was there 3) the service was pretty good considering how swamped it was and I told the nice server I was in a hurry and she was able to take my order from soup to nuts in maybe 10 minutes even though their credit card machine was down 4) I ordered a gyro and their orzo pasta salad, the gyro was mediocre and bland but the pasta was wonderful I will definitely try Carlys again when I am not rushed, the interior is hipster, funky, low key and the staff was very friendly."
5,"Havent been here since 1997! Man, now all the memories are back and cant wait to get situated in AZ for a couple days! ;-)"
5,"I had an amazing facial here!  The space is clean, inviting and relaxing. Park in the lot south of the building, it is less crowded.  After an hour of pampering my skin was glowing!  They offer many of different services including laser treatments. I will be back for some more aggressive treatments to fix up my flaws (not that I have any)!  Anyway, the staff is very professional.  Before or after your treatment go next door for some great Thai food!"
2,"Be forewarned, this is quite possibly the worst mexican food spot I have ever eaten at! If you enjoy authentic mexican food, dont go here! The only reason why Im giving their rating 2 stars versus only 1 star was because our waitress was very polite and serviced us well. The food however was terrible!  My husband ordered the two cheese enchilada plate, and the enchilada sauce tasted nothing like enchilada sauce! The rice looked like orange pasty mush and the beans tasted like canned beans. I ordered the chicken taco salad and this is the first time Ive had cold chicken in my taco salad. I couldnt eat it! The only thing good was the appetizer sampler that we ordered.  We were the only people there on a Friday afternoon and now I know why! Overall we overpaid for crappy food!"
4,"Ok reviewing the Waffle House is kinda lame, but here goes.  If you have lived in America at any point in the last 50 years you know they have good waffles and hash browns.  Is it the best breakfast option you could possibly encounter, well no.  Its just every once in awhile I find I just want Waffle House. ( Fond late night memories from college I would guess. )  It can be for breakfast, lunch, dinner, whenever. So what does this location have going for it that makes it better than the average Waffle House? 1. Lots of parking 2. Its not in a shady part of town 3. It has a really nice staff  4. They are fairly speedy 5. The restaurant is clean So there you go if you have a craving for waffles and hash browns then this is one of the better WH in the area."
5,"Went here earlier this spring and WOW - What a way to watch spring training  I LOVE the Giants stadium, and this is much better. It has twice as much lawn seating, the seats are wide and comfortable AND - aimed towards home plate, which didnt used to seem like a big deal but sitting in Scottsdale down the line, IT IS.  The food there is top notch, with an amazing pizza slice  Plus, the ability to walk around to diff fields and watch other players work out is amazing - it sucks that the Giants keep fields separate, I think every team should do such a joint complex."
5,"Top notch cheesesteak. One of the best in the valley. This place has a large delivery area, and is located right by campus. The owners are really nice and friendly. Im really glad something moved into this spot. Its so convenient.  Their desserts are great as well. I wish they had some chicken options, but they are new and said they would be adding to the menu as time goes on. My girlfriend said the turkey sandwich was fantastic. They sometimes carry Tasty Kake, so ask about that.  Ive had the authentic cheesesteaks from Philly, and this tastes every bit as good if not better. Its definitely in my top 5 local cheesesteaks. Edit: Just ordered delivery - Lightning fast! This place is incredibly legit. I went with a cheesesteak with White American cheese instead of ""wiz"" this time - So incredibly good. They tossed in a new dessert they didnt have last time which was awesome.  Their prices are really good and their food is so delicious. Im a huge fan. Im not kidding with this 5 star rating - I love this place. Rave rave rave..."
4,"Never had any complaints about this place, except it smells like death when you walk in. Ive always been well taken care of when Im here."
3,"Went to try it out yesterday morning.  The service was so-so.  It wasnt crowded, and it took awhile for me to be noticed (and Im 62"", 275!)The Arbuckles coffee was great.  Ordered the #2.....2 eggs, 2 pancakes, 2 sausage patties and 2 strips of bacon for $5.99.  Everything was fine except the sausage which had a peculiar flavor....the bacon strips were thick and tasty, the eggs okay, and the cakes were very good with an interesting touch....instead of the normal one glob of butter on top of the two cakes, there was one on top and one between the two cakes (made for easy buttering of the bottom cake).  All in all worth another try (might have been just an off day for the sausage).  Wish it were closer to home!"
3,"When I asked the server where he was from, it led to a discussion about   how historically trains would stop in Maricopa!  All joking aside, this place is a good after dinner spot or happy hour spot to come and chat with a friend about why there are no Amtrack train stops in Phoenix!   They have a decent wine list and I would not really sit outside here because it is nothing really special...but the place has its purpose."
3,"Taco Bell/Pizza Hut combo on Dobson and Southern. Typical taco bell food and service. Lunch is very busy at this location because it is within walking distance of MCC, Pima Medical Institute, Banner Desert Hospital and a gazillion apartment complexes.  Parking is easy, but this shopping center is very difficult to get in or out of during rush hour."
5,i love the $5 happy hours. all the dishes are a great value and delicious!
5,"If there was a Cantina Laredo in my home (Los Angeles) I would dine here regularly despite the multitude and variety of Mexican dining options.      Needless to say, when Im in Scottsdale, I often find myself drawn to Cantina Laredo.   From the moment youre in, to the moment youre out, Cantina Laredo takes excellent care of your tastebuds.  The chips are salsa arent filler but a real treat.  Their homemade salsas are worthy of bringing in your own jars to export back home -- some of my favorite salsa anywhere.  I believe they have three different kinds.  Their tequila options are wonderful allowing for creative margaritas or a fine neat glass of 100% pure agave goodness.  (I promise to never use that phrase again, sorry Readers.) The entrees arent just your common taco/burrito fare.  Using juicy meats, creative homemade sauces, and interesting pairings, Cantina Laredo professes its love for Mexican food and culture -- reminding diners how lovable these things are. The decor and various areas are all quite nice as well.  An excellent complement to what always proves to be an excellent meal. _C$"
5,"Love this gym. Not many know its here..lunch time is the best to get in. Ive been a member since Feb of 2009.  While the trainers are nice, its a revolving door. You are better off at this gym if you know what youre doing vs. needing 1-to-1 attention. Since LA Fitness just purchased PURE, this will only increase I imagine. Pretty disappointed that they no longer do monthly re-programs... But the gym itself is worth the monthly fee.  If youre looking for a place to be left alone to workout - this is it."
5,"Gymboree, many years ago I brought my first son to Gymboree quite often and really enjoyed.  Never thought I would be back, but now we have another gymboree tike and he loves it.   I am very happy to have been reintroduced to Gymboree and have already made plans to go again with my son next week.  The instructor made it look easy and really communicated very well with both parents and children.  Thinking about Gymboree now, my only regret is that I know someday my boy is going to outgrow it, and I want these times to last forever."
3,"Some friends came in so a group of 6 of us went here.  Cool little place with good atmosphere, basic and cozy.  Wines by the glass were good.  The bread was a bit stale but still pretty decent.  We ordered a variety of things.  The antipasto plate was good with several typical items.  My tomato sausage pizza was good, not great.  Needs some spice and flavor.  The halibut over sundried tomato basil risotto with aspargus was very good but the halibut was a little over cooked.  Otherwise, most everybody liked the food.  One person ordered a dish and asked for a little spice but it was way too spicy and they basically couldnt eat it.  Her husband ate it the next day because he could handle the spice but seriously it was way too spicy for most people.  Not a bad place, would probably go back but wont drive out of the way as the location is a little out there."
5,"One of the most impressive spots in town.  Lunch here is a luxury experience - the grounds are amazingly beautiful, and the menu surprisingly affordable. Try this for an inexpensive way to really impress a business client. For dinner they will take your shorts, though it is certainly worth it if you desire a truly memorable, elegant evening. Life is too short - try this restaurant soon! I have yet to stay here (Royal Palms hotel) - but it is definitely on my list of 1001 things to do before I expire."
5,"Just when Im about to give up on my search for good Thai around Glendale, I stumble upon a true diamond in the rough. Dont be fooled by the shabby looks of the outside plaza; the inside is contrarily well orchestrated with subtle Thai ornaments and design. A huge desk in the lobby and bigger one inside the dining hall gives this establishment an odd but distinct hotel feel. Much like that feeling, the service is intriguingly exceptional from the time you walk into the front door.  The food that Ive tried here so far is... may I say it... divine. I started off with the squid salad with mint and lemongrass and it was packed with fish sauce and shrimp paste. Score. I also tried some papaya salad and once again, it was mounded in fish sauce and chili. Splendid. Then I had the minced beef phad kaprow (which is not on the menu) and lo and behold, I was tasting Phuket in a Bangkok sort of way. To be honest... the sauces from each of these entrees mingle quite well. You can drizzle some of each dripping over rice and literally have an orgy in your mouth of Mormonic proportions. You can also bolster it with some more heat with their chili fish sauce, again drizzled all over your concoction. Let your adventurous mind roam free and order something outside the pad thai genre. It will pay off handsomely."
1,"whole foods whole paycheck wholly sh$t i am sorry there prices are rediculous the only reason i went there is because since moving here from a very foody town certain products are nearly impossible to find and they do have them but you will pay, my search today was mushroms not button but chantrel/oyster/ect i was going to get every thing on my list but when i saw shallots at 4.95 a lb i bought my shrooms and split the i hit frys, shallots 2.49 a lb and of course theres always trader joes"
4,"Impressive dinner tonight!  However, it was a packed house, and it took over an hour for my Panang Curry to arrive.  While I was a part of a large group of about 14, our particular group had 6 people.  One tablemates entree (Ginger veggie stir-fry?) arrived at least 20 minutes before the second tablemate saw hers (Yellow Curry).  It was at least another ten minutes before the third tablemate saw his, and so on...  I was able to sample my neighbors dishes of Spicy Catfish (battered and fried catfish topped w/ bell peppers, basil, and spicy red curry sauce) and Swimming Rama w/ pork (topped w/ peanut sauce over steamed veggies).  All three were AMAZING!  Ill definitely order the Rama and the catfish next time!!! Didi, our server, moved quickly, was efficient, and attentive, and was even helpful in suggesting alternate selections to those who had never had Thai food before.  She even warned tablemate Ericka, whod only recently discovered peanut butter as an entree ingredient, that shed either love or hate the Rama.  We were thankful that she rolled the dice and ordered it, anyway. I hope that the kitchen crew can work out the kinks as far as pacing goes-I hope that by next visit I can up the review back to five stars!! Ooh, do try the coconut ice cream w/ embedded grated coconut!  Not as good as Yuphas homemade coconut ice cream, but still  quite delightful :)"
4,"Canal has been a stop on many a ""bar tour"" through the Waterfront / Old Town area. The bar always has a good crowd in the evenings and the patio is fantastic on warm nights. With summer finally clearing out and it now being possible to sit outside during the daylight hours, we made our way to Canal for some late lunch / day drinking on a recent Sunday. First off, what a great place to sit and people watch!  This was the first time we had ever ordered food at Canal, so we were interested to see if the cuisine lived up to the hip decor and vibe of the restaurant. The baby burgers (3 of them) were served up on an ""English High Tea"" tray. Great presentation, and the actual taste of those little guys didnt disappoint.....ahi tuna / fillet mignon / ground chicken. The fillet was my favorite. What can I say? I like red meat! We also had the fish tacos.....delicious! A great experience, all around. Were definitely looking forward to getting back here for dinner soon."
4,"Im a sucker for popcorn, so when I saw a ""now open"" banner along with the ""My Popcorn Kitchen"" sign today, my car swerved around the parking lot and grabbed a spot right in front.  I swear, it was out of my control! It turns out, today was the first day this adorable little popcorn/candy shop was open... so lucky me, I get FTR (first to review)! Kim Brush, the owner, was front and center, and welcomed me as I walked in.  She also had a team of people working there that I assume were all training.  They were friendly although it was obvious that I was one of the first customers, so it took longer than necessary to package up my small bag of kettle corn.  The customer before me appeared to have been waiting awhile on her large bag of Puppy Chow (which looked pretty amazing).  The kettle corn I ordered was just the right balance of sweet and salty.  I had to dig deep to exercise my self-control and not demolish the entire bag in one sitting! I took a menu to go as well, and now as I look at it, I cant wait to go back to try more of the unique gourmet popcorn flavors.  Not only do they have the basics (Buttery and Low Salt), but they have all kinds of savory flavors including several different cheeses, Dill Pickle, Salt & Vinegar, and Southwest Jalapeno.  If youre more of a Caramel person, theyve got you covered as well, and of course there are a rainbow of Fruity Delights and Decadent Chocolate flavors too!  Popcorn Bags come in all sizes from Mini to Party and range in price from $1 to $149.95.  You can also order tins, boxes, and/or pots of popcorn and this place ships anywhere in the U.S.A. Congrats on your Grand Opening, My Popcorn Kitchen.  Let the popcorn parties begin!"
4,"We like it. L and I 2nd date was here, and we made out outside. It was hot and sexy. Do we remember the wine? We love wine,but I remember the kissing. Kissing beats any 97 point wine. D.C. Ranch overall, just has not made it, for restaurants and retailers when I lived in Az. This has nothing to do with the restaurant just an overall impression to yuppie?"
5,"Im giving this Office Max five stars for convenience, friendly service, competitively priced products a stocked shelves.  This Office Max is a great in and out shop. On one side there is the detailed supply store and on the office side, there is a complete copy center. Its open until 9 on the weekdays and they dont make you feel rushed if you get there at oh lets say...8:50. In fact, they are helpful! They walked me around and helped me find the random items I needed. The copy center staff was also very friendly.  This Office Max has your complete supply of office items but their prices are very reasonable! I purchased the same item at another shop that I did here and it was significantly less expensive here.  So on that note, I end my review on Office Max but I will report back with any new findings."
3,"Meaty, beaty, big and bouncy! Add ""beefy"" and youve pretty much summed up your 5GB&F  experience! After detoxing this morning, I was really hungry...after all, Im a pretty big and bouncy boy and when you lug this kind of tonnage up and down the canal, youre going to need some retoxing! And since its Taco Tuesday, I thought a burger fest sounded about right! I needed to be up north anyway, so I texted my order (what a time and vexation saver that is!...two stars for 5GB&F right there) and it was ready, hot and juicy when I rolled in. The burgers and fries remind me of nothing so much as Wendys of about 30 years ago...you know, when Wendys was actually pretty good (not like now when, they consistently screw up your order and figuratively, literally throw your bag-o-food into your car as you idle by the pickup window). The burgers are OK, the fries are fresh and peanutty (no, really...fresh peanut oil...the fries taste peanutty!), and the Coke is, well, Cokey.  The atmosphere is nice enough, all red and white checked and tons of ""look at me"" crap on the walls (""Best Fries in Hoboken!"") The music was also reasonably pleasant (Men at Work...""I come from a land down under""...I shuddered a little bit at the part ""and men chunder""...please, no chundering while Im eating!). Anyway... I was able to purchase this little repast for a mere $11.83 (I saved a little by having the small fries). I know, Grind or Delux prices for a retro Wendys burger! Im no spendthrift, but I could feed a family of 6 at In-n-Out for $12...and with better burgers. But, 5GB&F filled me up, they had my burger ready to roll and they very nicely didnt mess up my order (but then again, how could they screw it up...they were ordered to prepare my burger by a computer...we know what happens when you dont do what a computer tells you...you ""accidentally"" ride over a cliff on your Segway, thats what happens!)  And, in a nostalgic sort of way, they reminded me of how Wendys used to be (complete with 70s music), and for that, a reasonable 3.25 stars."
1,"if you like terrible service and overpriced food youve come to the right place.  If I knew before I went in there I would be paying $16.00 for macaroni and cheese, and had the pleasure of waiting around for an hour to get it, while my glass remained empty, I wouldve stayed away (which is what you should do).  Food wasnt awful, although 2 members of the party did cut up their mouths eating the hard as a ""Rock"" bread on their sandwiches. The mac n cheese was nothing special.  The service was beyond poor.  First and last time I will eat at Hard Rock Cafe."
1,"One of the WORST experiences of my life.  My friends and I decided to go and check this place out as the local radio kept talking about it.  So the day we decide to go, the guy from the Colbert report was there mocking the restaurant also.  We go in and we thought, ""hey wow, this is kinda cool"" as they talked about monster proportions of burgers and fries fried in lard.  However, once the food arrived we sat down and although the wait staff was scantily clad, all of them had ""cottage cheese"" legs and thighs.  We sat down, and my friend decides to take their super burger challenge, she said if he finished his 2 lbs burger, his meal would be on the house.  He kills it, and when we ask why his burger wasnt free, we could no longer find out waitress and the owner says to us ""you either pay or i come over the counter"" he threatened us with violence, which is stupid as all we were doing was asking what about what the waitress had told us.  We will never ever go there again.  Being Asian, he also spewed racial slurs at us, calling us to go back to where we came from.  ALL of us were born and raised in Arizona so I dont know where we would go.  Anyways, dont go here.   Also, all of the patrons, ALL of them were middle aged men, who instead of paying attention to their wives and kids were hiding away at a nasty restaurant whos burgers arent even really grilled.  the frozen patties from costco are placed on a machine that rolls the burgers through, so you cant even want a medium burger, they are all torched.  The fries although fried in lard, are crap.  All in all, if youre a lonely loser, this is the place for you.  If youre a classy kinda guy that wants REAL food, go to any other generic burger place and you will be more satisfied."
5,"Im very new to PHX. I ended up talking to a cop at the airport who told me about Thursday Rockabilly nights at the Blooze. I had to check it out. My friend and I walked in and were instantly comfortable, excited, and impressed. The AC was pumping, beer was cold, the music; rockin, and the crowd; refreshing. The bathroom was great!  They dont have food there but they will let you bring in whatever you want. We went there pretty early, around 7:30ish. Unfortunately, because of ridiculously early work on Fri AM, I had to leave once it was starting to get really packed and lively around 10:30/11. I am so glad that I finally checked the place out though. I will definitely frequent The Blooze as often as I can."
5,"Okay, if you actually like the taste of good whole foods and fresh ingredients this place is an Oasis of goodness. If your looking for a place that says they make natural foods but uses 2nd rate ingredients and comes up with recipes to hide the fact by using spices to cover it up your better off going somewhere else. My family took me here when we were visiting, and it is wonderful. I had the Pesto Presto sandwich and it was divine! I also tried my familys strawberry fields salad and Arizona rolls. They were all really good. The vegetables were fresh and high quality and the price for the portion and quality was a good price. I was amazed that they had a couple of options for people on the raw foods diet. The juices are different, but surprisingly refreshing. This place is a great example that eating well and health can be tasty and satisfying."
4,"Its the middle of January and 75 degrees out.  While theres no shortage of things to do outside, there arent many dog-friendly places for that where you can sit down and eat. Jacqui J and I took out doggies to the dog park.  Theyre bruthas, you see, and hadnt hung out in awhile.  We had MLK day off together and spend the afternoon together.  Trying to decide where to eat with the pooches, I thought of TMI because I had seen so many people recently check in on Yelp.   Their patio is pretty big and mostly shaded.  This wasnt a day to be too concerned about shade, since it wasnt hot out.  I read the reviews ahead of time and already knew what I wanted before I even got there.  I was happy to have to take home a doggie bag, too.   I got the olives, red goat salad and the mac and cheese.  I will eat anything that includes green chiles in it.  Anything.  A few varieties of olives were served wtih fresh herbs and a dash an oil & vinegar.  I love all olives and dont always buy them for home, so it was a real treat.  They came in a little bowl, but there were about 20 of them.  The red goat salad was perfect: tons of pistachios on it, big chunks of goat cheese and strawberries. And den...and den...the mac and cheese, generously stuffed with chopped green chiles, ooey-gooey melted cheese that was crusty on the edges, the way its supposed to be. Ill be back with Dexter.  They gave him a treat.  Oh, and my meal was treat.  Im burping up the leftovers as I type this."
5,"Today was the fist time I have been to Chino Bandito. My friend has been there several times and loves this place. After having a few beers, we were pretty hungry and decited to go here. This place is mixed in a sort of industrial corner behind a Walgreens and a transmission shop. Walking in you will notice how big this place is inside. Customer service was excellent. The counter person was great in explaining the different options on the menu which is a mix of Mexican food and Chinese food. Great concept for something different. For ten dollars I had the Carnitas burrito and a Jerk chicken burrito with Jerk fried rice and black beans and a large iced tea (all you can drink). It also comes with a Snikerdoodle cookie. Wait time was minimal and the food was brought very quickly to our table. I really enjoyed the items that I had order and I found the carnitas had the right flavor and tenderness in a burrito (you can also get it in a bowl). The Jerk chicken burrito had some zing to it. Enough to make me sweat a little. One thing that I noticed was that the employees were really good about keeping the place clean. Sweeping, cleaning the tables, wiping up around the drink dispensers. I also noticed that they wrap all of the highchair trays in plastic to keep the clean and dust free. One last thing, they have free wifi!"
5,"Please excuse this review as I am writing it as I come to from my food coma. We just moved to Phoenix and at the time of dining we were not familiar with the Fox Restaurant Group. We happened upon CD on accident on a Tuesday night. I must say the place was pretty hoppin for an early week night. We ordered the pretzels with fondue, the fried chicken and the steak. It was so good we didnt even speak to each other through the entire sitting. It was the kind of meal you dont mind having indigestion after because you get the pleasure of re tasting the deliciousness. Gross, I know, but you know what Im talking about! The server we had was as good as a ghost. We never wanted for anything but he left us alone. I wasnt super crazy about the monkey bread but my honey ate it like we hadnt had a ridiculously large meal 15 minutes before. Id kinda like to shave off like a 1/4 of a star because the staff was ultra trendy/Indie as were a majority of the patrons. They looked like H&M and Urban Outfitters threw up all over them but if thats the gimmick Im ok with it since the food was so amazing."
5,"I recently saw a Coyotes game here and I was seriously impressed. This arena is super nice, almost mall-like and clean on the inside. What also impressed me was how much stuff there is around the arena. Where Im from, youd have to drive somewhere else if you want to go to dinner before or hang out after the game. Here you can just stay in your cozy little free parking spot and hang around. Probably my only gripe is that the screens on the inside could be a little bigger, but other than that. this arena is right up there."
1,"This was the best camera/photography store in the valley.  It has now been re-imagined and renamed as Photomart upon its move to Scottsdale.  I recently visited the new location...and I was shocked!  The store was extremely small, had very little to sell (I didnt even see a camera on display).  They did carry some glass...but mostly a very small selection of accessories.  I didnt even recognize any of the former employees.   I encourage all the former loyal Photomark customers to visit Photomart.  Im sure you will leave disappointed.  Two thumbs down to this lemon!"
5,"Soooo this location is even better than the one in Superstition Springs. They also have a play place, which is pretty cool. I ordered the deluxe chicken and it was simply amazing. Fantastic service as well. I ordered and set my stuff down and within a couple minutes my food was brought out to me with a smile. Very polite staff, and delicious food.... what more could one ask for? I totally wish Chick-fil-A would sell thier Chick-fil-A sauce by the bottle cuz its sooo good"
4,"MAN BUZZ! The breakfast buzz is the ultimate meat head drink. I mean espresso protein and smoothie all in one? Cant beat it!  I have had many things on the menu here and all good. The bowls are awesome the breakfast club is out of this world and the veggie wrap add chicken(come on gotta do it!) is also awesome. Great drink selection, if you like Arnold Palmers ask for the Tiger Woods the next time you go in. E Atmosphere is super laid back with a great stay. This is the only thing to warn you about it can take some time if you dont call ahead but its worth it!"
4,"Tradition at its most... er.... um.... traditional. Every time i eat here i feel like i have been transported to any number of old family owned steakhouses on the North Shore of Long Island, or Brooklyn. The plush red velvet, the dark wood and button tufted leather... The place just screams STUFFY BUSINESS LUNCH. My first experience here was with a bunch of lawyer friends who were dying for meatloaf or a steak with creamed spinach...  The entrance is through the kitchen. That may seem a little odd, but Id bet it sells dinners. Who can resist the wonderful aroma. By the time you reach your table, you crave rare beef, as red as the decor.  Its the kind of place where you forgo the trendy drinks and have a Scotch with a splash,or a Rob Roy before dinner. The steaks are perfectly prepared, the garlic mashed potatoes are wonderful. I love the place. It isnt cheap, and admittedly, i have never paid for my own meal there. It has always been a treat from some friend who wears a suit to work, or some more traditional back easterner who wants to share their bit of meat and potato lovers heaven."
4,"I have been to the Freddys location in Gilbert several times and really enjoyed it so when I saw a Freddys had opened in my ""hood"" I was excited.  My daughter and I went over for some dessert and they did not dissappoint!  The custard was smooth and creamy with lots of toppings to choose from.  I have not tried the burgers at this location yet but if they are anything like the other location they will be very tasty.  And dont forget to try the shoestring fries.  I usually like thicker fries but these are nice and crispy and delicious!  Im so glad Freddys took over this location."
5,"i miss this place so much, its insanity.  ten high kentucky bourbon is all i can say.. and i never really cared how bad i felt the next day."
3,"yet another phoenix joint w/ hip decor and a solid menu.   nice gold on brown color scheme, soaring ceilings.   cute marker board to write all over at whim.  the food? some of the best glorified bar food in town, albiet pricey. sampled several top notch martinis, the smoked salmon app, good chicken burger and sweet potato fries.   place also has bocce ball which makes for a fun diversion.  my biggest complaint is the terrible acoustics.  It was so loud my ears hurt and I felt that a hundred people were simulaneously shouting into a steel drum.  Can we put some softies on the wall or something?  But then, again, its a bar."
3,"Whats not to like?  Stingray does stylish sushi and happy hours just fine.  This is the only ""chainy"" sushi place that I will eat at.  I cant stand sushi at Kona or, god forbid Ra.  I have always found the sushi to be fresh tasting, especially the salmon skin roll, which for some reason, is absent in a lot of establishments.  One of my other favorites is the summertime roll, its tuna and avocado delicately wrapped in soy paper which I love.  They also do a very adequate and lively happy hour where house drinks are half priced, and there is a nice variety of sushi rolls and apps that are between $3-$8, oh and sake bombers too! We went specifically for the fact that their happy hour lasts until 7pm, and they have a great patio.  We have always received attentive service, and when sitting at the sushi bar, you receive complimentary edamame and miso soup (although their version is kind of salty and not my favorite).  Friday the BF and I had 4 drinks, fried calamari, gyoza, 2 sushi rolls and salmon nigiri for $40.  Not bad, not bad at all.  The Biltmore location is where you will find me."
3,"The bf and I wanted to try someplace different on our venture out to North Scottsdale so we decided to give Coal Burger a try.  The menu is pretty small, which isnt good or bad.  I had the green chile burger and my bf had the bacon blue burger and we shared a side order of mixed fries.  The burgers were not bad but not great.  The flavors were pretty well mixed together but the burger itself was just blah!  The fries were ok as well, nothing special. I would go back to give them another try.  They have interesting sodas on tap that are natural.  The shakes look good so will try those the next time I am in the area."
1,"I am leaving this store angry and cant resist writing a review!  The staff is incredibly useless....if you can actually find someone to help you. The store is huge with very little signs to guide you. Therefore I always wander aimlessly looking for the one simple thing I stopped in for (even though I tell myself I will never go back) with no one to help me.  Today they were out of an item I bought last week and need more of to finish my project. I asked the only 100 year old lady I could find to check the back and she told me they have nothing in back and to ask customer service. The lady at customer service was actually a reasonable age and when I asked her to call the Indian Bend store she handed me their number and said ""well you can call them"". I stormed out soooo mad and this time I promise to never go back. Hobby Lobby or Michaels is worth the drive!!!"
4,"If you need any office supplies, furniture, printers, computers, or one of them fancy electronic book readers, then you should check this place out. Not being a teacher or office manager/employee, I only come to these stores for printer ink. I was greeted with a friendly ""Hello, can I help you find something"" by one of the employees. My friend was looking for a stapler which the employee quickly guided us down the aisle to find an extensive collection, although I didnt see a red Swingline stapler ;)   There is a huge print service station in the back and plenty of employees to help out with anything. Check out was super quick as there were three cashiers open and ready for a customer. Oh and I found out, thanks to my teacher friend, that you get a discount if you are a teacher. Pretty rad."
4,"wow! what an upgrade from LA Fitness.. with that being said, you can already tell this review will be positive.  I recently re-joined 24 hour fitness, after breaking off my membership back in early 2010 after moving away from home. I join LA fitness last January, and was less than satisfied with the broken equipment and that meatheads that seemed to frequent the south Scottsdale location.  Man what a nice ass gym, Its free weights and machines are all located next to each other and not scattered around everywhere. The cardio machines are in great condition and It was not super crowded where you felt the need to shorten up your workout. Staff was friendly and not pushy like LA Fitness.. and Lockerrooms are clean. Basically, this is a nice new facility that anybody would be comfortable working out at and its close to my school so thats also a MAJOR plus! 4 STARS"
4,"Great spot, but it gets wayyyy too packed! Sort of a double edged sword, if it werent always so packed it probably wouldnt be such a hotspot, but being so packed makes me decide to not go there about 60% of the time it crosses my mind. My advice, if you are gonna go, go early and lock down a good location..."
4,"LollyPOP vintage is pretty sweet! They always have something I like and the service is impeccable. I dont think its too over priced, I mean this Phx not SF or NYC!! of course u will over pay a bit. duh. U should def check it out ;)"
4,"I usually dont review chain restaurants since I dont want everyone to know that I eat at them...but I have to give a shout to this location of McCormicks!  We were in Phoenix for a quick weekend and I had neglected to do any Yelp research before leaving, so when my bf found M&S from the concierge we decided to give it a go.  We had been disappointed with our last experience at the one in Dallas so I was mainly just hoping to have my hunger satiated so I could go to bed. I was very pleasantly surprised.  We were hungry so ordered what felt like tons of food (dont judge!).  The mussels and bruschetta to start were great!  The mussels were small, the way I like them, and the sauce/broth/bread soak they were in was amazing.  I had the halibut stuffed with a bunch of stuff as suggested by our server, bf had the dover sole, both were good, but that dover sole was amazing!!!!  very light and perfectly cooked.  I wish I could cook fish like that. We finished with some kind of passionfruit mousse dessert that was SO good.  I almost took another one to go. The service was great.  I would go back to this M&S location anytime I was in town."
5,Love it! Closest thing in Tempe to the food we actually had in Thailand.
4,"I have confirmed the rumors that Big Wong will be closing before the end of the year. The owners have been locked in to a lease they assumed for the last 15 years and with the down-turning economy arent able to continue. If you want a very reliable meal in a super friendly environment, rush on over before they close their doors forever.  : ("
5,"A must for us when we visit Scottsdale.  Whole family finds what they like and the burgers are fantastic. Very well priced and easy to bring the family, have some wings, burgers a few beers and not break the piggy bank."
5,"We ate here to celebrate our engagement during a weekend getaway to AZ. My fiance had coordinated with the restaurant beforehand to have rose petals and 2 glasses of champagne set for us before we arrived. The rose petals were fresh and a mix of red, yellow, and pink... beautiful colors! I ordered one of their fish dishes that came is a REALLY hot skillet, and I accidently burned my hand on the skillet. We saw one of the employees walking by, so we asked if he had anything for the burn, and he ran off looking for burn spray and bandaids. He was back in no time with everything I needed to treat the burn - amazing service! I THINK his name was Nick, but I cant remember. Good job, T Cooks!"
3,"This was my go to Vietnamese restaurant for pho and rice plates not because its my favorite but because of convenience. Pho Avina is closer to me but that place is terrible so I end up going to this place. It also helps that LeeLee Supermarket is one street over so I get a Viet fix and my Asian needs shopping in one trip. The pho and com tam is average. The service is fast and friendly enough. I do find it a big stingy that they dont bring out the bowl of broth/soup before you get your rice plate unless you ask for it.  All in all this place is fine if you just want an average meal; nothing to rave about here. If I felt like driving farther, Id definitely hit up Pho Van in Chandler for pho or Com Tam Thuan Kieu in Mesa for com tam."
1,"Service was slow and horrible. Got the steak and eggs.  Steak was half fat. Waiters response was ""Oh!  We have a new supplier"". He didnt take it back and charged us any way. Eggs were cold. Stay away from this place for eating. Bar looked happening."
4,"Love this place! I wasnt sure about it the first time, seeing that is in a strip mall, but like the saying goes dont judge a book by its cover.  I order the CHICKEN W/ GREEN every time and have not been disappointed. EGG ROLLS are wrapped in thin egg roll paper, spicy, & delicious. MANGO CHICKEN & CLAY POT DISHES are also excellent. Independent & yummy."
4,"Nice people, great food.  A really nice white linen place.  Loved the chicken karachi, naan, samosas, chicken pakora.  Wife had a lovely red, I had a nice premium margarita."
2,"Third visit was lower than second, which was lower than first.  Excellent service, but declining food quality.  Bacon was chewy, eggs ordered ""over hard"" were nearly raw in the middle.  Manager was rude to me and snapping at the help, who were doing a wonderful job.  Must have been having a very bad day.  I might try them one more time, but probably will move on to better places."
3,"Its like a 50 inch LCD TV mounted in a crack den. Something nice located somewhere shady. I ran to Circle K across the street for a late night Diet Pepsi (yeah, I know how to party) and I felt like I was on an episode of ""The Wire"" about to do a hand to hand drug buy. Hotel is decent.  Nothing special on the outside.   Bed was damn comfortable so I guess thats all that matters. Free wifi throughout but good luck getting anything over 1200 baud modem speed.  (my inner nerd coming out) Make sure you stay on a Wednesday, there are free drinks and appetizers in the courtyard. Bust out your flack jacket and sprint to the lobby and youll be all good. Free shuttle to and from the airport. Hood."
3,"Very cute, pretty good sandwich and coffee.  This is a pretty good place to stop in between shopping sprees.  They have really good/healthy sandwiches and good coffee drinks.   *Service = really fast and nice *Food = good and healthy *Atmosphere = relaxing and cute *Brownie = yummy :)"
4,"ok, so really. how can you go wrong with burgers? i guess its a just little absurd to me that people dress up to eat a burger. or that people choose to drink a glass of pricey wine instead of say, a root beer float with their burger. speaking of which, their rootbeer float is too pricey for what you get.... at any rate, i took my brother to eat here once upon a time, for kicks and giggles. see what all the hype is about. we were actually seated really quickly on a busy night, and quickly ordered our burgers. they were good. that goes without saying. and i really enjoyed the decor and the fries in the mini shopping cart! yes, something so ridiculous it is adorable. i dont really like having to order fries separate, because i think they should just come with your burger, but i digress. the burgers were juicy, came out fast and piping hot, cooked to our specifications, and surprisingly, not too much more expensive than my childhood fave, red robbins. ok fine, at least their fries had yummalicious dipping sauces. id go again, just not on a busy night. and maybe id dress up a little more. but then id feel crazy - like, why am i wearing a dress to eat a burger? but i do like those fancy-schmancy burgers... i guess i can suck it up."
2,"Its unfortunate their menu only has 4 sandwiches on it. The food was good, albeit leaves a lot to wish for. It came on a plate with a couple olives and nothing else. I would expect more for the $9-11 price tag.  They market themselves as a sandwich shop but I just dont buy it.  More so, it was a hipster hangout where it seems people go to look cool.  Granted, the few items the did have were quite good, but I just expected a nice turkey sandwich, but that wasnt happening.   The service was on the verge of incompetent but the owner did swing by with a loaf of bread.  Too bad we had to ask for oil at the counter to dip it in (our waitress was absent).   Their water was unpalatable and they didnt have a lemon, lime, orange or anything wedge to make it slightly less offensive.  My friends that live in Phoenix told me though, this is just the way it is there.    All in all, I certainly wont be rushing back but there is plenty of room for positive improvements."
1,The salad plates were not chilled... As they usually are it however is a busy night but somethings are expected at the olive garden... The food tasted like it was under a hot lamp for so long it tasted almost hard and also under cooked for the seafood... Not a great experience at the olive garden there are certain things expected... The expectations are not that high shouldnt be that hard to do....
4,"I adore RA!  They have a great selection of sushi.  Go for Happy Hour.  Its only a couple of hours, but you really get some great items for pretty cheap.  You can even get a large Asahi for about $5!"
3,"After hitting up the bank to sign some paper work, I wanted to stop by the Biltmore for a quick lunch and had Paradise Bakery in mind.  As I was making my way through, I encountered a new facade with Southwestern designs that I have never seen before.  ""Cool!"" as I exclaimed to myself.  It looked intriguing enough that I went in to ask the hostess for a menu.  After gazing around for a few minutes, the Chimichanga Entrée caught my attention! Content I was! jadore Chimis! After being seated in the, rather blandish, outdoor patio area with mistifiers cooling away, I put in my order: a Chimi and an Arnold Palmer. Not too long, my waitress brought out some cool, fresh salsa and chips.  Nothing too dazzling, quite ordinary.  Chips were crispy, oily, and a tad salty.  Arnold palmer seemed to lack both the sweetness and citrus. Now come the Chimi with a side of rice and beans.  Typical Mexican, you would think right? Well, up until I took my first bite into the rice! Puzzled face I was--like an Anime character.  I steadily kept taking small bites after small bites, analyzing what in the heck I was eating.  Generally, it was just sweet and overpowering what I would think a Mexican rice should be.  The corn bits probably only enhanced the sweetness further! The waitress confirmed honey was used but I initially guessed coconut! The beans with pieces of bacon was just simple and watery.  At first, it seemed to have that smoky, cowboy-ish hint to it, but fell short of a decent side. The Chimi was quite underwhelming in its overall taste.  What blanketed this deep-fried burrito were green chili (tasteless for the most part), drizzle of this sweet white cream (unsure of what), and some white cheese (unsure).  The tortilla shell was crisped enough and the chicken shred lacked the savoriness that I would have expected from a true Mexican joint. Nothing made sense to me! Where was the Mexican? I tried very hard to find the positive in my meal.  I quit half way to be honest.  I hate to mention this, but I did garbled some of what I chewed back out to my plate.  Overall, it missed the savoriness that would have saved the meal.  I desperately wanted Tabasco sauce like it was the end of the world, but unfortunately it was too late. I explained my calm, analytical dining experience to my waitress and she was very understanding and was fine with removing the item from the bill.  5-stars for that. I really am unsure of returning as first impression is a pretty big deal to me.  The happy hour menu did not look that appealing either. I guess the question is, how much can you expect out of Mexican-esque establishment that sits on a Fashion Park?  Heed, heed, heed this review."
5,"The spring on our garage door broke and we had no idea who to call.  Lodi was recommended to us but they wernet specific as there are a few under this name.  I choose Lodi Garage Doors & More and was stunned they sent someone out within 1.5 hours!  They also quoted me on the phone and were so nice in setting up the appointment and calling back to confirm. Gene was our technician, he was efficient, friendly and did a fantastic job.   I will be passing Lodis name on for sure and if repairs are needed in the future I will not hesitate to call!  Thank you for you quick, professional, friendly service!"
5,my first time here at blue 32 was great. i came for happy hour I had the chicken wings and a chambord margarita both are fantastic! service was friendly and fast.
4,"I think ordinarily I would give this place 3 stars, but this review is based on my experience here on New Years Eve.  After attending a Coyotes game, we came over to the Yard House for a late dinner.  Not surprisingly, the place was packed but we were able to find a couch to sit on outside during our 1.5 hour wait for a table.  Yeah, thats a long time to wait for this place, but like I said it was NYE and we didnt have any later plans, so we didnt mind hanging out.  Coincidentally, you can get full bar and menu service on the couches outside and we enjoyed some drinks while happily waiting for a proper table and chairs for dinner. The food was OK; nothing really to write home about.  My favorite part of the meal was probably dessert - the warm brownie with ice cream was a treat!  When we finished our meal, it was about 11:15 p.m. - definitely too late to go somewhere else to countdown to the new year.  So, we hung out.  Our waitress, Jaime, was very friendly and surprisingly attentive for how busy the restaurant was.  She gave us festive top hats, tiaras, and beads to wear to celebrate.  We were also provided with champagne for a midnight toast.   All of this was free, and there had been no cover charge to get in.  I thought that was a really nice touch.  At ten minutes to the hour, the music turned off and the volume on the TVs, which had all been switched to the big ball drop in NYC, was turned up.  Everybody in the restaurant excitedly awaited the arrival of the new year and when the clock struck 12 there was toasting and cheering.  Yeah, this may all sound very mellow, but it was a fun, relatively cheap (given that every other place had a cover charge and/or price fixe menu), safe place to bring in the new year."
4,Superb beer selection. Music was really nice and at a good volume. Really a great place to hang out and have a drink. We missed (aka were too tired to stay up past our bedtime) a jazz jam session. Will have to grab a coffee and hang out next time because I miss me some good jazz. Its so hard to find in Phoenix!
2,"Ive been here four or five times and never been too impressed. The atmosphere, art installations and eclectic seating gave me high hopes. The location is also unbeatable, walking distance from my place. But the service has always been sub-par, like its a bother to take my order and converse with me.  Everyone here, including most of the clientele, seem way too cool for school.  The iced tea, my usual, is good; the iced coffee is great-tons of flavor and plenty of body. Espresso drinks are pretty standard for your indie coffee shop. Ive asked for their vegan pastry (which changes daily) three times only to be told that they ran out for the day. I know that this happens, and I love that they freshly bake their goodies everyday and have a rotating menu, but I would also like to try the vegan scone sometime please. Today, I ordered a strawberry-raspberry-cranberry smoothie ($5 for a small!) and confirmed with the boy behind the counter that the smoothies are vegan/non-dairy. He said yes then informed me that they use Naked juices for the base then just add fruit and ice. (Naked juice! So thats where the $5 price tag comes from!) Three minutes later, I was handed a delicious looking smoothie topped with...whipped cream...? Really?!"
4,"Great sandwiches at reasonable prices. The bread is good, the au jus was flavorful and not too salty, and the sausages are made daily.  It was nice to find a place to get great sandwiches. The line moves a little slow, but its definitely worth the wait. I had the italian beef and my friend had the sausage, both were great."
4,"Are you looking to get a cat? if so, check out PetSmart. My wife and I adopted a kitten here and shes awesome. There are always several cats (occasionally dogs) looking for a good home, some older cats (a few years old and some kittens.) There is an adoption fee, but the cats will come with their shots and are neutered/spayed. We also use this store to get both wet and dry food and toys on occasion. There are many sizes and brands to choose from at good prices. The food is cheaper at PetSmart than Petco, unless the item is on sale. I would recommend to get a PetSmart card to save a few bucks. The store is always clean and staff very friendly and helpful."
4,"The Roosevelt seeps a cool vibe that can only be attained by converting a historic house into a den of drunkeness. Ah, a bankers dream. This is where my coworker, Dani, and I went after eating at Sens. She was going to a blind date and didnt want to show up alone, for fear that this guy would be a total psycho who would cut her hair and eat it in front of her. But this time, I already had two incredibly strong and delicious martinis from Sens and was very glad to have taken the light rail. I ordered the oatmeat stout and was quite pleased with it. Can I just say how much I loved the decor? I totally want to move in here...or use it as inspiration for our next home. So, the blind date guy wasnt a total scode and I let after half an hour. Dani, who was apprehensive about meeting this guy--whos a doctor, and I told her if she wasnt interested toss him my way (sorry, honey)--ended up having a good time with a nice guy. We both ended the night exactly the same: Passed out with a cocktail in our hands."
4,"This particular Budget Lodge is a hidden no-frills gem. We spent a single night here after a long days travel. Two story motel with gated outer access stairway, balconies to second story rooms, two inner stairwells (carpeted). No elevator, which is a shame as we had rather a lot of bags to bring inside. Still, a very clean, comfortable room. Ladies, you will appreciate the bathrooms. While the towels are not spa-quality, the room had a pleasant palette (yellow, white, chrome and beige) and one of the best showerheads Ive had the pleasure to use in a motel. High enough to adjust and not hit my head (Im just shy of six feet). Excellent water pressure.  Our balcony overlooked the alleyway and nearby buildings but the rate, the sleeping accomodations and the overall comfortable feeling surpassed any minor discomforts.  Id stay here again."
4,"Ive been two Pie-Zanos twice now and I think my wife did the best job of describing the format of this unique dining experience:  Subway for Pizza.  Of course, this is not to imply that Pie-Zanos is staffed by mouth-breathing ""pizza artists"" or stocked with sub-par ingredients and generally filthy.  On the contrary, this ""Subway of Pizza"" is staffed by congenial and hip 20-30 somethings who are eager to please by heaping  tons of fresh and flavorful ingredients  onto your individual personalized pizza.  Pie-Zanos allows you to pick from wheat or white dough and from up to 8 different sauces.  From there you can add herbs and crust flavoring and then you can pick from 6-8 different cheeses.  Then you select from the widest selection of pizza toppings youll find anywhere.   The fare is basically affordable as long as you dont go apeshit on toppings (55 cents each after the first).   As a special bonus they have Pepsi products.    I have also enjoyed the breadshits which are fresh and delightful and pair nicely with the traditional red marinara as well as the tomato-pesto.  My only complaints with Pie-Zanos and what keeps it from achieving 5 stars is how busy it gets at lunch, limited indoor seating and the fact that they allow childrens birthday parties which, when mixed with ubiquitous bad parenting, quickly turns a hip and snazzy pizza joint into a Chuck-E-Cheeses."
3,I was looking for chile rellenos and this place does a great job of making them just the way I like it.  Flavorful and not dry.   Also had the chips and salsa which I did not think were anything special and you have to order them unlike most Mexican places where it is expected at the time they serve the drinks.  Flan was unimpressive.  I think I will go back for the chile rellenos and head down the street to Carlsbad Tavern for the flan (theirs is my favorite).
5,"This is hands down the best place for bagels... but more importantly... after all my travels it has the BEST Bialy ever. I just wish they would open on in Greenville. Oh it is soooo good, a poppy seed bialy toasted with cream cheese... I guess I can only hope they are always open when I visit Scottsdale... .n"
2,"There are few things I cannot stand more than eating out for pizza-by-the-slice. Those are: slices so big they contain an entire days worth of calories and charging additional for traditional toppings.  While I understand the appeal of this centralized pizza joint -- a slice is 1/4 the pizza itself. The crust is a couple inches high and the pizza itself is barely 1/4 inch. I had cheese and while cheese pizza isnt remarkable as is, the slice I had here was considerably unimpressive. We paid $9.31 for 2 slices and a 20 oz beverage.  What also put me off to this place was the cold staff and multiple things did not seem to be working right while there -- including their ice machine and their sound system (cut on and off). I was also not impressed how, never truly hearing of Sals before, the employee made it seem like a chain of few. Go to their website and you will realize otherwise. This location is franchised. I will not return (unless I am not paying). Instead, I will take a jab at one of the other multiple fast food options on that corner."
4,"I came here for the first time on a rainy Tuesday afternoon for lunch with a great friend I hadnt seen in 6 months.  Our server who was cute as a button picked up our ""we are not in a hurry vibe"" right away.  We ordered a bottle of wine, fairly priced and loved the added touch of a chilled wine glass.  Our food was very good but no real risk was taken. We shared the fish and shrimp tacos which were flavorful but I had to add some hot sauce to give it a little bite.  The beans and white rice were a simple filler, nothing more.  The menu looked interesting and the prices were fair so I would definately try it again. There were only 2 things that I found disapointing, first was after we ate I ordered a martini, one from their menu, it was fruity and you couldnt taste the alcohol at all.  The problem was it was served in a very small martini glass and I feel when you are going to make a fruity concoction and call in a martini the glass should be bigger, not the James Bond shaken not stirred size. Second problem, as we were eating a woman came and sat at the table right by the restrooms and plugged her computer into an outlet that made the cord block the restroom door.  Now my companion and I couldnt decide if she worked there or not, she never ordered food and wasnt there long.  But just the fact that the cord blocked the door and could have been hazardous really bothered me. Overall though I give the place a B+"
2,"I give up. When you can still see the dough through the sauce and the cheese and the $2.00 extra cheese, and when the manager looks at it and says ""yeah, thats extra cheese"", I wont be going back. Sorry."
4,"Consistent.  Fresh Mint offers a very consistent product.  This is a vegetarian restaurant with a Kosher designationl. The menu is Asian, with traditional dishes served with tofu or just veggies.  The tofu is flavored/shaped as with its more traditional dish (i.e. Kung Poa has chicken-flavored tofu, Beef dishes taste more like beef).  Personally, I prefer plain tofu over flavored and they will substitute to your taste.  Also, for GFers, they do have some dishes that are GF (no soy sauce--such as curries).  No upcharges for any subs or even brown rice... At lunch, hardly a seat is available. Its nice to see that this is more crowded than the fast food joint that is closer to the street.  A slight tention can be felt for the business of the staff; however, this restaurant is consistant every time...its worth trying folks."
4,"Buy Local Coffee is what a sign out front of this establishment says.  So thats what I did.  I went to Copper Star Coffee to get my drink of choice, an iced coffee with cream.  I enjoyed the flavor.  It was better than Starbucks and quite a few cents cheaper.  SCORE!!!  I became a regular.  I stuck with my ice coffee for months but their bakecase was calling my name every time I would enter.  I found out Copper Star bakes their own pastries fresh daily.  Another SCORE!!!  No preservatives or high fructose corn syrup.  I started adding a scone with my iced coffee.  They have chocolate chip, lemon, blueberry, etc.  Delicious!!!  The apple sauce spice cake is now my favorite.  It is a vegan pastry.  It is flavorful and the glaze is so slight but fantastic.  Not a vegan by the way.   I have been slowly branching out among the Copper Star menu.  Try the Black Cherry Limeade.  The specialty coffee drinks are quite good too.  The blended toffee drink rocks.  The antioxidant smoothie is refreshing.  The other smoothies are okay.  They use syrup in those.  I dont know how healthy that makes them.  (Real fruit please). Lets talk about their sandwiches now shall we.  I have tried their sesame tuna, the curry chicken, the deviled egg salad, and the veggie.  All of them are winners.  You wont be disappointed.  Copper Star just unveiled there new sub sandwiches as well.  They use a local butchers sausages for their subs.  Awesome.  Way to keep it in the community. -internet access -community board -art work -misters for the heat -water bowl for dogs -drive thru car hop service -frequent customer stamp card The Copper Star building is an old service station cleverly gutted out and made super cool.  The staff is great and they stick around.  Not a high turn over.  It must be a great place to work. Parking can be tricky.  The majority of the parking is on the street and the parked customer cars creep into the surrounding neighborhood.  You may have a little walk.  Big Woop! A must.  Check it out."
5,"There are many places in the valley and its surrounding cities to eat Mexican food; however, there is one and only La Canasta. In the last two years the boyfriend and I have eaten at this restaurant location quite often. For the money, you get exactly what you pay for: a decent meal and generous portions. The chips and salsa are ever-flowing and the salsa is some of the best Ive tasted. The wait staff are generally pleasant, attentive and very accommodating. Plus they frequently recall what you had during your previous visits. I recommend you try the Machaca dinner or my boyfriends favorite dish, the number 5 lunch special. There are multiple locations in the valley, but this one beats them all hands down."
4,"So I am not usually in the Tempe area, but a friend told me about this place. So I though I would go try it out. I got a Grande Latte that was around $4. Not a bad price. But what made it worth it was that I guess this Friday I went was a Free Shot Friday. So I got an extra Espresso shot in my latte making it a triple for $4 bucks...no that is a deal. Not sure if they always have the promotion on Fridays. But it sure did make my morning a little better. Their menu is very easy to read and give those no too educated in the was of coffee a good description of what each drink is and how it is made. The had a ton of great looking pastries even though I didnt sample any. Cakes, Eclairs, Scones, and I think even what looked like cheesecake.  The decor was very interesting. An old fashion coffee house meets a gypsy vibe. I think they have Wifi too. I saw a few people on there computers. The service was a little slow I think. Felt like I was waiting for my drink for 10 minutes and the place was not really that busy. This was probably because of the guy ahead of me when I walked in who had about 7 different modifications to his drink. I have worked in a coffee place and those people are kind of annoying. So I will let them slide on the time of service. Overall a great experience. Would have been 3 stars, but when you get something for free, in my book that is an automatically another star."
5,"Went back to True Foods ( i have been doing this a lot since my first trip) with my mom for dinner last week. It was amazing as always however this time was different. I tried a new menu item, the Bison burger ( i highly reccomend this) it was so tastey and very light for a burger. OMG! I want to say that this time was different because we had THE BEST SERVICE EVER! Our server Marcus was amazing. He was very informative, helpful, polite and everything you would expect from a server and then some. LOVE THIS CAT. Just thought I would give credit where it is due. Too many times you read about the negatives on service and not so often the positives. I work in a restaurant and know its important for employers to know who their ""stars"" are. MARCUS is your star. A bright, and shiney star. lol Loves: Shitaki mushroom lettuce cups, Ahi sliders, Spaghetti Squash, Kale Salad, Raviolli, Green Tea, Coffe (black) and I always have to have the Banana chocolate Tart. Definitely ."
5,"How many great things can one say about the Cartel? Does Infinity work! Yes, that was a statement, not a question. I am in love with the CC, hands down. I have traded my gold Starbucks card in for this amazingly Delicious start to my day. The iced coffee ( actually, its Toddy, which is better) is amazing. They roast their own beans, and allow the iced coffee to sit over night, creating an extremely potent concoction. The hot drinks, A+++ as well. And, the food? A+++++ (5, yup its that legit). Grab the cheddar bacon muffin... its literally heaven. No joke. Heaven. Little clouds may form above your head; white clouds of course! Not those nasty rain clouds. OK, maybe not clouds. But defiantly your day will be sunny because you stopped into Coffee Cartel. And not because you live in AZ. Duh.  Only complaint I have is the hours. I live right next door, and their only open M-F (like so many places in DT-Pho).  PLLLEEEEAAAASSSEEEEEE open up for the weekends!!! Ill work for free! Well...wait... Ill come visit."
5,"When we first moved to Ocotillo the first thing we did was peruse yelp for the best local eateries. Mikado was one of the first things to splash onto our radar and we had to check it out. Luckily for us Mikado is literally a 2 minute drive from our house. :) The restaurant is low-key and I like how the lighting is a little dimmer than usual to create a more mellow ambience. The servers are all very attentive and kind which makes the eating experience so much more enjoyable.  So anyway, on to the sushi! I adore sushi rolls with some kind of crunch in them which is why I love anything tempura. The Big Shrimp Tempura Roll is my favorite and it could stand alone as a meal because its so ginormous. They stuff 3 large tempura shrimp in there with avocado and cucumber then drizzle it with eel sauce. LOVE! And while Im on the subject, Mikado has mastered the art of frying up a perfect tempura. Their tempura shrimp is super crispy, isnt greasy and always fresh out of the fryer. The Crunch Roll is superb, the salad dressing is addictive and the chicken noodle udon soup is delicious. Their prices are great and you still get so much food. How can you go wrong? If youre within a 20 mile radius of Mikado you need to stop by. Also, I cant say this enough: Please support your local businesses! They depend on your patronage!"
5,They have a mechanical bull.  Need I say more?
1,"Refused to give water to young teen & referred her to PF Changs.  Olive & Ivy handled this poorly, unprofessionally & pathetically.  PF Changs didnt even hesitate to give her the water.  Thats why I ate there instead."
3,"3.5 stars.  We decided to check this place out after all the waves. The space and decor is nice and cute, and girly! We arrived at 10:30 for a Sunday brunch, and there were plentiful of empty seats for us to choose. Nice patio, too! I had the French Toast with fresh strawberries and chicken apple sausage (however, the menu says with raspberry, I didnt really care for either one, meh~) The toasts were thick and soft, but werent that outstanding. I really liked the chicken apple sausages on the other hand, they were tasty and not the typical greasy kind. Friend had the Spinach and Tomato Omelette with feta cheese. I didnt take a bite, but she really enjoyed it. It came with a side of potatoes and fresh fruits.   Our waitress was nice, but the service was slow... Overall we had a nice little trip. Its definitely a good spot for a girls day out!"
5,Fresh bread....awesome beans!!! Raspado...tostitos!!!!
4,"I hadnt been there in years, and it was all I remembered.  I went with a coupon that I go purchased on the Living social website.  Champagne toast, appertizer, salad and all you can eat entree.  They also do a complimentary photo for you.  Very quaint and romantic.  But the food was fantastic.  We had the cheese fondue that was just delicous.  The meat course was also wonderful.  But the thing that really made our experience great, was waiter.  He was great, and funny and he was there when you needed him. But I do not suggest turning up there without a reservation.  You can make reservations online, very quick and easy and you get a confirmation."
4,"Dangerous place to shop!  Lots of neat imported goodies, many in sample sizes so you can try them out before buying the bigger size.  I got about 6 different flavors of hot cocoa, a maple sugar candy in a maple leaf shape for me (Michigan thing), and filed away a lot of ideas for gift-buying when I get home.  I might even ask Santa for a gift card to World Market for myself!"
5,"I dont think Ive ever been to this place when its not been crazy busy. Its just a small little eatery, but its always busy. They have some great food and the peanut butter pie is delicious. Just a place to hang out and enjoy some breakfast, lunch, dinner or snacks at. Parking isnt the best and that is a problem, but if you live close and can walk, its ideal."
5,Excellent macaroons!  Great owners very conversant with their costumers.
4,"I really love their sourdough bread. I get the veggie on sourdough and really love the taste. Drive through line is a little long and sometimes the bread hurts the top of my mouth, but this is my favorite fast food place. OH.. the pizza is great too! I always get cheese with jalapenos. The bread they use for the crust rules.  Indoor and outdoor seating. Staff does not speak English very well, but I have never had an issue with my order. Been there at least ten times."
5,"This place is beautiful, great patio with classic decor.  Went to Happy hour...of course and had a few glasses of wine and  yummy calamari.  Service was off the charts!  We were sitting on the patio...a little hot and Schwetty...and the server kept moving the umbrellas to shade up as the sun set...WOW!"
4,"I have to admit, the reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 3 is a) I want it to stay in business (which can be hard on Mill these days!) and b) Its one of the few places on Mill where you can bring your child without feeling like you may get heckled. ;) lol Now, I definately enjoy a night out without the babes too, but this is a place I go for happy hour with my husband and daughter. The beer/wine is good, the food is good (I like the southwestern egg roll apps), the price is good, the service is good, and the atmosphere is nice (thought I was going to say good, huh?). We love to sit on the patio and people watch."
4,What a shame! It was a great place to hang out :(
4,"Every time I head to Phoenix, I have to head to Chino Bandido. The food is in large portions and very filling! It is interesting how Mexican and Chinese food come together but it seems to work as this place was packed. I ordered the vegetarian quesadillas and it was loaded in raw veggies but I would have liked to remove the cheese and I was not sure if I could because it was so packed in there!  Try the food out, you will not be disappointed."
4,Eorth a trip for pasta or their salads. Both are wonderful. And if you like garlic they know what you mean when you say xtra garlic. They actually give you extra. Yummm. Of course you will probably not be kissing anyone that night.
5,"This place has amazing frozen yogurt! I had the strawberry with small pieces of fresh strawberries! It was a wonderful treat in this heat, since its yogurt and not ice cream, its a little bit healthier."
4,"We really liked this place. I got the grande burrito with zuchinni & peppers i it which was really good. Loved their carne asada and the prices were great. I wish they ha more on their dessert menu. Would love home made churros! Staff was friendly. Would for sure go here again. Much better than baja fresh, rubios, tace bell & most other mexican places around PHX that weve been to."
5,I rented bikes here for the first time today and took them for a ride on the green belt.  It was so fun and the husband and wife working the shop were so friendly and helpful! I will definitely be a returning customer and recommend this to people who are looking for a fun outdoor activity.
5,"Fair and honest prices.  Friends and I have been ripped off by other companies for the last several years wondering if there was anyone honest left.  During the summer, youre at the mercy of the air conditioning techs and usually they take advantage of it. Im very happy with their service.  Very prompt and professional.   Father and son make a great team. Great warranty service.  An electronic part he installed died after 3 weeks.  He came out immediately and replaced the item for no charge."
5,"It is great.  Great ambiance, food, and service.  I love the rooftop bar too."
1,"So the food at this place is good. Well the sliced turkey sud. But when it came to delivery and internet ordering. Oh my god the incompetence of these people. After and hour, 15 mins after the food was suppose to be delivered (the order was 2 turkey subs and garlic cheese bread.) I called and was told that there was no delivery guy and if i can come pick it up that they would knock off 25%. But the foods not ready yet, how long does it take to make 2 subs. So i pick up the goods and damned if i didnt check the bag they didnt give me the 2nd sub. Ugh they never checked the order. If you have online ordering  you need to follow though. So with a second phone call and a second trip to the place and 2 hrs after the original order i FINALLY get home and eat. The only good thing i got was a free lunch.  For that I give them a 1"
3,"I tried Rare Earth for the first time as a solo diner.  Often a good way to get the take on a new restaurant.  I sat at the bar which has surprisingly uncomfortable seating.  Really hard seats that cut me in the back of the knees.  The wine selection is nice.  Not big but two or three choices of each variety. I ordered a glass of wine,  a small House salad and a pizza.   The server behing the bar was ""professionally friendly""   Then the wait began.  Fifteen minutes passed and I still had no salad.  I was able to get the servers attention and asked about my salad. She didnt check on the status of the salad but gave the excuse that several people had come in around the same time that I did. Just about 3 minutes later both my salad and my pizza came out at the same time.  Very disappointing.  I wanted to eat my salad but I didnt want my pizza to go cold.  Note: This is extremely thin pizza...like a cracker crust...so it goes cold very quickly. The server offered to send the pizza back to keep it hot but since it had fresh tomato on it, I didnt want the pizza to be ruined. The house salad was fresh, good mushrooms and shaved pecorino cheese.  There were lots of red onions and the dressing, a house vinaigrette was very strong ""and vinegary"". For me the onion and vinegar were just overwhelming and I would not order that particular salad again. The pizza had a good amount of toppings and held together pretty well, even considering how thin the crust is.  I would like to try this restaurant again because there were several things on the menu that sounded really good. 4 stars for the pizza, 2 stars for the salad that I ordered and 3 stars for the service."
4,"Ride the bulls gals and put on a show :) Just wear pants, please!! Fun spot to get drunk and do kinky things with cotton candy! Great happy hour specials! Extremely generous bartenders and huge portions of food. Well worth the money!!"
5,I love that this restaurant can accommodate  all types of people. Its a sports bar with Family style entertainment! The staff is always friendly and  they aim to please. The food is always good and prices are very reasonable. The bar is on one side so it splits the Families with children on the other side with an amazing area with tvs to play Xbox and wii. Check this place out. You wont be disappointed.
3,"Probably the most overrated place in the Phoenix area. There pizza tastes way too much like their canned tomato sauce and there is always a wait to be seated.  That being said there food overall is OK. There meat salad and cal-zones are good and the servers are friendly. For all the people out there giving it more than 3 stars: try other pizza places like spinatos, la grande Orange, pizzeria Bianca."
5,"Decided to call CityWide based on positive online reviews. We suspected a slab leak and a really expensive repair. Robert showed up within 20 minutes, determined the source of the leak within 5 minutes, and it turned out to be something really simple and inexpensive. He repaired it with a brand new line, we paid, and he left within a half hour of us calling CityWide. Very professional, friendly, and efficient! Would definitely recommend CityWide for anyones plumbing needs."
5,"I just had my first Tammie Coe cake last week for my birthday, and I will NEVER be the same again.  I dont normally eat cake, in fact, if its not Brownies, I dont eat it.  But this cake drew me in with its appealing fondant.  From there, I got lost in the spongy richness of the cake.  A cornicopia of flaverful goodness. So make a metal note to yourself, I will only eat Brownies and Tamie Coe cakes. Oh, and special thanks to Arts G (previous review) for telling me what the hell fondant is.  I was just calling it ""sheet like frosting""."
4,"The Pilgrim represented everything Thanksgiving. Turkey, sweet potatoes, stuffing, and onions  all in a crust. It was served with a side of cranberry sauce, and red wine gravy. I loved it.  Its a must try if youre around ASU. The only thing is that its really small, but you should be fine sitting at the bar."
5,"The mozzarella tomato and basil sandwich is the BEST sandwich in Phoenix, hands down. If you havent been to Pane Bianco you are truly missing out."
4,"Good food, decent selection, open late (for you partiers), decent delivery time."
3,"I ordered the Peanut Panang Chicken.... I rqstd to the waitress that I wanted extra Bell Pepper. When it came, it had -NO- Bell Peppers at all.... i actually didnt realize this until about 5 mins into eating it. could not find our waitress, I waited about 7 mins, finally, I had to get up & search for her. I found another waiter & told him my problem. He took my Dish, but then came back to tell me that they are ""All out of Green Bell Peppers. Would I like Red Bell Peppers"". I said yes, of course.  This whole experience has put a sour taste in my mouth about this place, which is next door to the mediocre Good Egg on Central.   I like Wild Thaiger on Central MUCH better instead!"
4,Yummy breakfast!  Enjoyed the pancakes.
4,"Went to Cricket Pavilion to see Jack Johnson- 10/10/2010..Great show- fair venue. It was WAY COOL that on this show- staff came around and handed out green recycle bags for your cans and bottles! Only Jack!! More artiest should take note!! Had some drinks in the parking lot before the show- a few tailgaters were around us, pretty nice crowd overall with no hassles. There is no way that they should have any shows there between June to August! Thank God the weather broke and it cooled down.. you get that many people together dancing around and it generates some heat! Typical venue prices.. HIGH! $10 - $14 mixed drinks.. $8 - $14 beers..They had Pabst Blue Ribbon Tall Boys for $11!!! HA! you can score a case of PBR for $11!! NUTSHELL- Great show, good weather, good crowd..Free parking is awesome!! If I had to see a Rockn Metal Fest in the middle of summer there- I Wouldnt!!"
5,"I have been here several times now and have never had a bad experience yet.  Good food, good service; no complaints.   Still have never made it here for happy hour, but their specials during that time seem like quite a deal.  The staff are always friendly and seem to remember us from one visit to another.  Ive only ever eaten sushi here, but they have a lot of other menu items that I would like to try at some point, but I always turn to the sushi as it has always been good and fresh.  I would recommend trying this restaurant."
5,"Imagine for a minute that youre waiting in a really long line. No, its not the line ride. You see a menu on the wall with your ordering options, but before you are anywhere near someone that could take your order, youre yelled at. ""Hey! What do you want?"" Dont be afraid, but dont be surprised either. Keep your cool and order your dogs. Immediately start thinking about if you want fries or rings (onion rings) and be prepared for when youre called upon again. Then watch as your hot dog is mutilated in front of your eyes and what appears on your tray is what looks like a hot mess of decapitated food. Never fear though... because it is amazing. Well worth the wait and one of the best dogs youll ever have. My favorites here are the white hot and the bratwurst. Whenever I know Im going, I end up salivating like Pavlovs dog for hours. The booths are classic hot dog stand style and the pennants lined up along the top of the walls are fantastic to look at. One started a whole conversation and research one day about a basketball team we knew nothing about."
5,"I was looking for a place close to where I live for eyebrow waxing and I was referred by About Face Salon here.  (According to AZSpaGirls, About Face are the eyebrow experts but they no longer offer the service....)  They were great about squeezing me in the day I called.  Angela was fantastic, she worked very quickly and with a very light hand.  She is so good with the wax that she doesnt need to tweeze at all, which for me is always the worst part.  (Granted I dont have very um, complicated, eyebrows).  She was very sweet and for $15 I will be returning to her."
1,"What a crap airline!  If I could give them zero stars I would.  I flew from Phoenix to Denver to New Orleans.  The check-in people, gate staff and flight attendants were rude and abrupt, the flights ALL left at least 45 minutes late, it was the worst flying experience Ive had.  I was fortunate thta my Denver back to Phoenix leg was US Airways...never thought Id say ""Thank you US Airwarys"" for at least that part of the flight not being a nightmare!  I will never fly United again!"
5,"It does not get much better than this, fellas. BS West is hands down the best gay bar in Phoenix. Friendly bartenders, cheap drinks, good-looking crowd, great music..its definitely got it all. Best night to check out is the obvious 2-4-1 Wednesday.  Thursdays and Sundays can also be fun if youre into karaoke. Saturdays are a nice alternative if you dont really dig Forbidden or Amsterdam, its a different crowd. It definitely has a ""Cheers"" feeling to it... not pretentious whatsoever. Great patios too, especially the back one with the new video screen they installed. Oh, and their Halloween bash is THE party to be at. 3,000 people attended in 2007."
5,"We had a bad experience in May with a person at Charlestons we thought to be a manager (see review).  The next day my husband and brother-in-law contacted the restaurant manager, Chris, we had great and immediate communication with him and he encouraged us to give the restaurant another try as we had been happy there before.   Recently, we had a large party of family members dine at the restaurant and the service and food was perfect.  Chris made a point to check in with us at the table and at the end of the meal.  Great job, Chris and team!  We look forward to dining at Charlestons with you again soon."
4,"It has been several months but I hadnt lost the formula (80/10/10 - veggies, meat, noodles).  Pat down some chicken-turkey (no taste difference as far as I can tell) with the wax paper.  Load up with mostly veggies (more green than red or white), add some wheat noodles to fill the bowl to the brim.  Follow with the sweet and sour mix but add some extra vinegar and orange sauce.  Add some pineapple and all set to have it grilled.  Fill a small bowl with peanuts and another small bowl with pineapple.  Fill the large red plastic drinking vessel with ice and low cal lemonade.  Then chow down... My formula has more or less stayed the same since being introduced to YCs by Mike T and/or Erik T.  Both took different approaches and none tasted like the other despite selecting choices from the same line.  Amazing how three related people ended up with very different meals especially Erik T with cod fish and Mike T with who knows what kind of sauces except they were very dark."
3,"Theres two ways to look at this place. One is getting quality food at a good price. The other is getting a lot of food for a cheap price. I prefer the former but those who prefer the latter wont agree with my review. I thought the scramble I had was okay but nothing fantastic. I definitely didnt care for the biscuits. The food wasnt health conscious at all but if youre looking to fill up with calories and get a good-sized portion then this is your type of place. Also, I am not a fan of the diner-type ambiance... I would rather have something with more character but Im glad I tried this place out."
4,"Great place for happy hour and drinks.  Really cant beat pints at $2.50, good long happy hour 7 days a week.  The sandwiches are all good, the salads make great sides instead of the chips and the tiny cherry sized tomatoes are to die for whether you get it on the bruchetta or cheese board plate.  Thursday late happy hour gets pretty busy and so does friday late afternoon into late evening.  Saturday night it picks up after happy hour ends.  Wish they had burgers and fries like the Living Room in downtown Phoenix."
3,My goodness this place has gone downhill. Yeesh.
3,"went midweek and were seated right away Table was clean, service was adequate but food, meh. Hasbrowns barely cooked and no flavor and the famous biscuits were more like mini loaves of bread with no biscuit consistency and the gravy was honestly just blah.  After hearing such rave reviews I had to try it once but dont need to go back.  Kinda sad because I love breakfast."
5,Nice Plaza.  Very well located.  Clean store.  Friendly staff.   All you could want
3,"The novelty of this place garners it some brownie points, and you definitely dont come here for the food.  Yes, scantily clad nurses will serve you your food, cheerfully chat you up, and be agreeable to a photo shoot at the end of your meal. Youll also appreciate the little things Heart Attack Grill does (i.e. conveniently placed mirrors at ass-level behind all the counters for any patrons ogling pleasure), and theres no shortage of little quirks that definitely give the place character (i.e. their refusal to serve any diet sodas). The food kinda sucks, though. Ill admit I liked the huge and considerately chilled Coke bottle, but thats about it. The fries were quite...flaccid and stale, the burger didnt seem so fresh or special, and it was relatively pricey for the amount of sustenance you get. Even so, you dont need more than a single bypass burger, unless youre itching to be useless for the next few hours, or if you are a gorilla.  Yet the clever presentation of what might sound like a practical joke with poor taste makes this place worth visiting with some friends. Youll have fun, and youll be plenty full by the end of it!"
3,Sherwin is old and not very reliable but he is a really nice guy. I will give him that much. Very good optician as well
5,"My six year old daughter and I enjoyed a fun and memorable date night at Melting Pot last night. It was her first exposure to fondue and we had a blast eating great food and talking about her first three days of first grade. We starteed with a fantastic spinach and artichoke fontina & butterkäse cheese fondue, then shared the ""Land & Sea"" (filet mignon, chicken and shrimp). Of course, when the dessert menu came out so did a bit more enthusiasm. She had never dreamed of seeing a pot of melted chocolate before. The looks on her face were priceless. She chose the ""Cookies n Cream Marshmallow Dream"" and it was crazy good. Im looking forward to taking the whole family and to making this a more common stop on our date night calendar."
5,"OK OK... as a Proud Italian I hope my momma dont see this! Im actually going to give Dmoes a 5 star rating for a few reasons. Last Friday, me and my 2 brothers left the suns game, and proceed to put a few ""adult"" beverages back. At around 2am, when Haneys shut down, we had an overwhelming craving for crap pizza (its better than our normal Jack in Box at 3am run that usually ends up with someone puking in the drive thru line because the smell of the taco sauce is so amazing). Low and behold, the ONLY spot that was still taking orders (up to 2am!) was Dmoes. Now, 1st off - I live at Summitt (by BOB). These guys gladly delivered to me, all the way down there! Major props for that. 2 - They understood me... considering I dont remember ordering the pizza (I woke up to pizza and wings boxes all over my pad, and me saying ""who ordered pizza"" then I burped... wing sauce and vodka is a healthy combo. 3 - apparently, after checking my voice mail, the driver was pounding on our door for about 5 minutes (we were REALLY jamming out to Rock Band, in case you dont know, were pretty awesome. Wikipedia that Ish ladies and Gents; Kansas City Bullriders). Well, the driver and my door man both called 3 times. Im assuming the driver eventually came in and grabbed the bass guitar and strummed it out. Maybe he had a slice with us? Who really knows these things. However, I do know that I was insanely impressed with Dmoes... from the left overs I ate the next when I could remember. It was pretty darn good. Between the awesomeness that is called ""their customer service"" and the legit taste it left in my mouth, Im a believer, unless, if I say Im not, will I get a commercial?... hmmmm.... Potential there...."
5,Brie and Apple with Fig bruschetta....I dont need to say anything else!!!!  (except $5 glasses of wine til 5 all week and $5 mimosas til 5 on the weekends)  Best place to spend a Sunday afternoon
3,"Okay.....so....I have this thing about going out in Scottsdale in the first place because Im always like ""that one natural haired black girl"" in a sea of blonde, tan, slim chicas! But thats neither here nor there.  The Lodge was OKAY in my opinion. For it to be in Scottsdale where everything is super expensive for no reason the drinks are pretty cheap. I had a couple of shots and a drink and spent under $20. The bartender was SUPER sweet and she knew my name by the time I came back for my 3rd drink.  They have AH-MAZING food deals. Like, get a burger and a beer for $6. Of course its not a top notch beer but.....who doesnt love burgers and beers?? There is music...coming from somewhere and its always pretty legit, a good mix.  There is like an intimate, cabin sort of corner with flickering romance lights when you first walk in if you want privacy but we usually go outside to the deck and people watch and/or play cornhole....Either way, I wouldnt say this is my favorite place ever...but I dont hate it either.  Plus there is always a line of cabs outside waiting if you are too schwasted to get home :)!"
5,"Saw this place in the Yelp email.  Needed to take my son to Toys R Us to use a gift card and it occurred to me that Habit Burger was right there, so I suggested we have lunch there rather than the usual McDs.  I temped him with the offer of a chocolate shake. I was amazed with the cleanliness and brightness of this place.  There was a line when we got there, but it moved quickly.  The tables were packed but we managed to snag a 2-top pretty soon after getting in line.  My son had the kids grilled cheese meal (something you dont find at your standard fast food place) and I had a charburger.  We shared his fries and the shake. OMG - the burger was heavenly!  The roll gets a little grill to it so it has a little crunch on the inside.  It was not greasy at all, just tasty and soooo good!  The fries were equally ungreasy and good - crunchy too.  The chocolate shake - my son only had about 3 sips which left me to drink the rest of it (dang it) - was absolutely delish.  And the prices were outstanding! Its a good thing there isnt a Habit Burger closer to my house.  Id eat there all the time!  Five Guys?  Forget em!!!"
2,"I could not find a place to park my Honda Civic and enjoy the trails.  After about 60 minutes of looking.  I gave up.  Need more options to get there, and where to park the car so that the trail can actually be enjoyed.  I will save my time and go elsewhere. Suggestion:  Should consider developing an offsite parking area, and providing a shuttle to the entrance (perhaps for a small fee)...and let it be known where to find the shuttle."
2,I would rather go to Benihana to be honest. I have been here a few times because its so convenient but has never been worth it in the end. I have eaten here and had dinner to go it always takes forever and it is not cheap I expect cheaper if theres no atmosphere or really good food would make up for it. I have not gotten sick from the sushi here but lets just say I didnt feel so hot after eating here the last time. I looooove sushi and its hard to say that I wont be back here but Id rather drive a bit farther and skip running the risk.
5,"So many great accessories and cute clothes! I got my accessories for my Wedding here, and they were perfect. Everything from clutches to earrings, from cute tops to watches, they have everything color coordinated!"
1,"I have always been a fan of Burlingtons deals, however I will not be shopping at this one again. I went to return a belt... pretty simple. Instead, I stood in the customer service line for 15 minutes thanks to an employee of Burlington buying/putting things on layaway. It took three other staff to help her out. There were no words said to me except ""Hold on"". I was pissed. When the lady was finally done, the employee at the service asked ""what do you want?"" Serious help is needed there!  If you work in the area of ""customer service"" I think you should have some."
2,"I went here to try a  new salon and they were very rude when i first walked in like, I was wasting there time, I just wanted to know about there tanning prices and they kept trying to up sell me on there other products even though i kept telling them no thank you, finally when i got a tanning bed they asked how long i wanted to go for, i said the full  time and the lady tells me i should do less time because Im a red head, I told her that i have been tanning for years now that Im fine with the full time, she still gave me a hard time saying i should do less, finally i was like whatever and did less time. The only reason I give them two stars is because there beds are really nice and i got good color from them, but it was not worth the hassle for me to want to go back."
5,"Divine,  the Carne Asada was so tasty,  flavorful and tender.  Everything we enjoyed tasted fresh and authentic. The guacamole was knock you socks off, traditional and limey, (I took my extra home and enjoyed the next day).  I liked what the previous reviewer who said also that the beans and rice are not an afterthought here, they are also amazingly well executed.  I am eager to get back an try the Chicken and Barbacoa as well as the roasted green chile cheese dip.   If your in the area of 44th Street and Thomas, forgo the big chain of Chipotle and show this lovey Phoenix gem some love, your taste buds will not be disappointed."
2,"They play two kinds of music here: country and western.  The place is about the size of my one bedroom apartment.  Its a dive for sure.  Its cheap though.  But cash only.  The food is actually not too bad for bar food.  Overall this place doesnt impress much, but considering you dont have a lot of choices for Laveen, you cant really compalin either."
5,"What a fabulous dining experience! My boyfriend and I are always looking for new places to try and came upon this place on Yelp when our regular Saturday spot decided to no longer be opened for lunch Saturdays. Right upon entering we were greeted by someone behind the register and he sat us down at a booth. The decor was great and the place was spotless. We ordered the Saturday special of Monte Cristo, the potatoes and the biscuits and gravy among other items. The Monte Cristo was perfection and the home made blueberry and strawberry jam was excellent! The potatoes were seasoned to perfection and eggs cooked perfectly. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and this is now going to be our regular weekend breakfast/brunch place."
3,"playing the ""poor college student"" card here, i went to bookmans with a dvd player, computer speakers, a digi cam, an iflip, and about 90 dvds including some tv sets. they took 4 of my dvds (2 seasons of l word, my nightmare on elm st. video set [including 3d glasses, in great condition - what a find, that bitch cost me $100!!!], and a family guy i think. and they gave me $12. what a load of shit. they took the dvd player, digi cam, and iflip of course. gave me like $33 for those. again, rip. overall, kind of picky as far as what they take, cuz when i was browsing the shelves, lots of the movies i had/was turning werent on their shelves. so instead, i took all my dvds to mo money pawn shop on 12th and indian school and got 85 big green bitchez.  it looks like they have a ton of books, which is pretty cool, but i believe in a system of free literature, aka the library. screw you, bookmans! however, you get three point five stars because not only did i find my favorite lez movie lola, but another great flick by the name of everyday people."
4,"Great meal all-around.  Was hoping for an authentic experience...and that is what we received from start to finish.  Really enjoyed the grilled lamb and chicken, with garlic sauce on the side, and a Turkish coffee to finish. Service was attentive and friendly.  The staff was clearly proud of their food/restaurant, as they should be... Highly recommend!"
4,"Theres a lot to love about The Mission.  The experience comes so close to 5-star that it makes me want to nit-pick about all the tiny things that fall juuuust short so they can fix them for my next visit! The Bar: What a lovely, refreshing Basil margarita!  It was just sweet enough without being syrupy.  But bartender, why is getting a recommendation out of you like pulling teeth? The Food: Excellent table-side guacamole; it lived up to the very high expectations set by all the other reviewers.  My dinner partners Hangar Steak was very juicy for such a thin cut and the dressing from the tomatillo salad give the whole dish a tangy, acidic bite.  My Chorizo Porchetta was very unique and flavorful, but a little more sauce wouldve saved it from being slightly dry.  I love though how the star of the entrees really is the meat here, the portions were generous and the sides were an accompaniment, not a competitor. ***Almost forgot about the pumpkin bread pudding we shared!  He loved the scotch-carmel sauce which I thought was too sweet.  I loved the moist, fragrant bread which he thought was missing pumpkin-y spice.  To each their own! The Atmosphere:  Its a gothic romance come to life with beautiful dark metal chandeliers, warm, glowing salt bricks, and dim lighting.  I just wish the table of 6 old men talking golf wasnt sooo close.  A little more room between tables would complete the intimate decor. The Service:  I have no complaints here!  Our server was excellent and never overwhelming, the lady who made our guac was all charm, and kudos to the chef who sent us complimentary street corn (yummy by the way).   A note on the street corn: I felt like this was a dish that wouldve won the Top Chef competition where they had to re-invent convenience store food.  The grilled, slightly salty & crunchy corn topped with creamy spicy cheese sauce beats any AM-PM nachos Ive ever had! :) Lots of wonderful food still to try here.  I will be back very soon for brunch with mom!"
5,"So, I now frequent The Vig.  If you go, talk to Jason, the bartender.  Hes quick with the beverages and funny.  Enjoy yourself.  You deserve it!  This place can get packed during dinner hour, though."
3,"This place is cute, affordable, clean, and tasty. I would recommend this place for a quick lunch since the service is fairly quick and has a simple menu. Or you can bring your date here for a cute dinner date. The place is a fairly quiet place, and the lighting is very nice."
4,"i love lgo and have to stop myself from going there more than i already do. while their pizza is delicious and the commuter sandwich is bomb.com, i really go in for the sweet treats like crack cake, brownies and salted chocolate chip cookies. on top of the food, the atmosphere is great and they have an assortment of treasures in the shop. only 4 stars since they keep the music too loud for me to want to stay too long and parking stinks if i want to go outside oft he hours of 9 - 11."
2,"I really like the ambiance here for breakfast but the service is TERRIBLE and they are always out of staple items, like English Breakfast tea.  I had a morning business meeting breakfast here, paid the bill and tipped 20%. I asked for more tea and got charged again, okay, fair enough. I paid the additional bill but did not tip again on the $2.50, the waiter followed me outside and confronted me about why I didnt tip again on the second bill as I was standing with my client. Tacky.  Also, they need to step up the menu.  The menu is limited and not prepared very well, which is a shame, because it has a great Euro Cafe type of environment."
4,I stayed at the Montelucia for a long weekend and went to Joya Spa for a massage and for the nightly blow out special.  I wish I would have taken advantage of the spa each day since we were staying at the resort.  It is a beautiful spa.  Although it is pricey compared to other spas Ive been to they pay attention to every detail and the staff is great.  My massage was unbelievable.  I should have requested the longer massage.  I also got a deal on the massage through a separate website since they did not offer any discounts on services.  The reason I did not give them 5 stars is because they automatically add a 30% gratuity to your service.   The prices were extremely high to begin with.
3,"I got the chicken burger today, it is pretty good.  Grilled, juicy, and cooked just right.  The fries are always hot and crispy.  The wait for the food took a little longer than normal, but I know they are very busy.   Bummer our service this time was a totally miss.  At first she was great, check came took our drink order and food at the same time (we were ready).  She checked on us after our food arrived and we ever saw her again until the bill.  We both were so thirsty, NO REFILLS.  She offered us later that she can bring our refills in a to go cup.  That is great, but I would have liked a drink with my food instead of choking it down."
5,Super!
4,"Had to go into Scottsdale yet again, this time to the quaint Scottsdale Mall.  Well went there for a reason, after seeing Jewel of the Crown on PBS ""Check Please"", I was hungry for some Indian food.  Monday night: not busy a couple people eating out on the patio, and a large Indian family eating there, seems like they were talking about the recent demise of Bin Laden and they had their children there eating and studying, so I imagine it was all owners family.  But they werent annoying and well behaved.   Greeted immediately, felt welcomed and liked the look of the decor with a kind of strange old time piano music in the background, they served us some crispy, spicy rice (?) cracker with two sauces.  I really liked the taste of those. Ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala (medium heat) and we also ordered, oh what is it called, chicken something with spinach, and garlic Nan bread. Chicken tikka masala was very nice, it came in a kind of pot that was still bubbling.  I like that, the only thing was I would have preferred more spice, so next time will go with hot and not medium.  The other dish was decent but could have used a bit more kick, but that was ordered mild so that was our error. Great iced tea, very refreshing and they kept it filled without asking. I wish I lived in this area, all the cool restaurants are in SCOTTSDALE!! Son of a mother, why is that the way it is?  Not fair. Anyways, enough about me, I would definitely go back, heck I would even go out of my way from Glendale to drive over and give it another try, it was definitely above average.  The food was hot and fresh, with nice ambiance and service."
3,"I have never written a negative review but unfortunately I think this place needs to get it together. It is in a location that never seems to be successful. I drug my husband over excited to try it and hoping to see an improvement. No such luck. No vegetarian entree, not really kid friendsly, small portions, pricey. Not what we were looking for in an evening. Love to support new restaurants but wont be back. Hope they figure it out and make it work."
5,"I think its about time I wrote a formal review for this establishment, considering I have recently bestowed it as ""My Favorite Restaurant"" - thats a big title to carry.  I often judge Mexican restaurants based solely on their chips and salsa and Gallo Blanco passes that test.  They have a delicious green tomatillo and smoky chipotle - as well as the typical hot sauce and fresh pico.  Their chunky guac is delish and summery, as they put orange slices in it.  Although the chiccharon gets a lot of buzz (I think it taste like Cheez-Its), their best appetizer is the Elote - grilled corn-on-the-cob with cheese on it. It literally melts in your mouth! Oh, and it doesnt get stuck in your teeth like most corn-on-the-cobs tend to.  The orange cake is AMAZING and reminds me of my beloved red velvet - except, you know, orange.  I love everything about this restaurant - salsas, food, drinks, atmosphere, prices, entertainment (on Wednesday!) - they just need to get rid of that damn giant, ugly, silver air conditioning thing they have running through the bar."
5,Love this place. Great Happy Hour.
4,There is a huge menu for this restaurant.  Only tried sushi and noodle soup combo dinner so far. Lots of options on noodle soup dishes.  Each noodle soup has a different soup base.  The combo dish adds another small side dish option.  Lots of food for your money. Sushi is decent and reasonable price.  Great Japanese family-style restaurant.
4,"I am not a beer drinker, so this is not rating the beer, but the food and atmosphere. 1) Atmosphere: sweet - great patio and nice bar scene inside 2) Food - pretty good for bar food 3) Hit it up if you are in Tempe, its just one of those places you need to go"
4,"Everything about Coronado Cafe is charming and scrumptious.  Its my go-to place when I want to have a nice, but not fussy, lunch with a friend.  The menu has a lot of variety but not so much that its overwhelming.  Ive never been disappointed by the food.  The raspberry iced tea is delicious too! I like that they dont have any fried food, though my male friends dont so much appreciate that as they prefer fries with their burgers.   Conversations can be challenging when dining inside-- the acoustics in an old house arent the best to begin with, and then you cram it full of people and it gets a little noisy.  If you cant tune it out, the patio is a really lovely alternative.  All in all, you really cant go wrong here!"
3,"This tiny sushi joint is in a prime location.  Thats the real draw. The sushi is just okay (and you can get the same sushi at Geisha-a-go-go which is more fun).  The hamachi kama is just okay.  The steak is just okay.  Overall, this place is average. I wish I had better things to say about it, but the service was not great (it was not bad, just average) and the bill was high considering the quality of everything we ordered. Would I come here again?  Nah."
4,Love the bar! The two guys that sing and play music there Wed thru Sat nights are just amazing.  Manuels has very authentic Mexican food. Best enchiladas and refried beans around.  Bar is adorable after being renovated recently. Restaurant could use some updating.
4,Great establishment and especially for it being a chain. The place is clean and has a transparent kitchen allowing us patrons to know that the ingredients are in good standing. The prices are within good range and the seating makes it very convenient for groups. I like their menu its simple yet offers enough options to make it an agreeable spot.
2,Beer Selection 10/10 however service is 1/10. Staff lacks product knowledge. Specials are not mentioned. Wait time is long. Staff makes you feel like they are doing you a favor by taking your order.
5,"One of my fondest memories as a child is traveling to Alameda to visit my great-grandparents, one of which was Filipino. The food! Yum!!!  It had been years since either my mom or I had Filipino food. We both moved to Arkansas 20+ years ago but I recently moved to the valley. The first time I came across Hey Joe was last Spring when my mom was in town and we visited the Old Town Scottsdale Farmers Market. Pancit? Lumpia? I was beyond excited when I saw the truck. Yes, I get excited about good food. Everything was fabulous. I have since tried the breakfast dish which was absolutely delicious.  Service is great, prices are wonderful. I will definitely be back."
4,LOVE IT! Food & Service always great!
5,Went here last night for the first time in years. I used to hang out all the time here when I was younger. It was packed by 1030. Great music mostly top 40 and hip hop..no techno yay! Good looking crowd and not as pretentious and the rest of Scottsdale. Everyone had a blast..dancing everywhere. Friendly crowd. Reasonably priced drinks for Scottsdale. I cannot wait to come back. Patties still has it!
5,"I cant believe I hadnt been here before yesterday!  Talk about a hidden gem!  I was taking a friend around to cross stuff off her ""List of Stuff to do Before the World Ends"" and smoking a hookah happened to be on it.  Therefore I googled places nearby us and Oasis popped up. As soon as we got there the guy at the door welcomed us in with a smile and opened the door for us and once inside the waitress/bartender helped us pick a table and took our drink orders.  We decided to get the peach hookah and an order of the Hummus and Pita Deluxe with beef.  The food was delicious and the hookah was great!  The staff was awesome the entire night as well.  Everyone kept checking on us to see if we needed anything and they would just stop and chat with us as well.  One guy was even helping my friend try to make smoke circles!  I definitely love that theyre open until 4 am on Fridays and Saturdays too because its always nice to have somewhere to wind down after all the bars close!"
4,I had not been to this location since they remodeled the inside its really clean and nice... Friendly staff I was impressed. I ordered the chicken finger basket it comes with fries and two pieces of toast... For the sauces I went with the honey mustard and the gravy... I rate the food as followed. Chicken Fingers - B Fries - B Toast - D  Gravy - B Honey Mustard - B I will be back again for lunch plus I really wanted a blizzard.
1,There were 3 cars in the parking lot and people walking to the door but the young lady closed the doors at 9:51pm The young lady spoke through the glass for atleast 4 minutes explaining she would not open the doors I live behind this location but I may not return. There is a Walgreens off of 7th Street...
5,"My profile says.... My Last Meal On Earth: Chicken and Waffles Lo Los is the reason why.  Everytime I visit Arizona, I make sure I hit this spot up.  I usually order the Lo Los meal which comes with 3 pieces of fried chicken, with 3 waffles and a scoop of butter with syrup.  YUM!  This meal would not be complete without ordering their super delicious Sweet Tea which is served in a glass jar.   There are two locations, one in lower Phoenix, and the other in Scottsdale.  The one in lower Phoenix is the original location.  However, its much smaller so wait times could vary.  The Scottsdale location is much bigger,  so dealing with long wait times should not be as big of a  problem. Winner Winner Chicken Dinner, Lunch and Breakfast please."
4,"Im a value sorta guy...considering that, I should HATE this place on paper, but the quality, selection of items you wont find other places, and general vibe of the store are fantastic.  You will pay top dollar, but you get top notch stuff in return! Their baked goods are exquisite, their meats are the most gorgeous chunks of dead flesh youll ever see, and then.. theres the Beer & Wine. Wow."
5,"This place is so unbelievably cool. In a city desperate for arts, this is perfect! ""Her Secret is Patience"" is a bold statement for downtown, a sign of youth, renaissance, and complexity. Its serenity and over-looming stature make it something to admire. I wish more public spaces in the Valley were this awesome.  Its worth checking out, even if its not your taste in art, youve got to admit its pretty interesting. Be sure to see at at night too! Lots of beautiful colors accent the homogenized office buildings. :)"
5,"This place does not disappoint.  Ive been here quite a few times with coworkers and its always a good choice. Cute place - I especially like sitting on their cozy, covered patio.   I hate mushrooms but somehow LOVE their fungi pizza.  I think its the truffle oil that makes it amazing.  Ive had a few of their other pizzas too, which are quite good as well. All of their salads are delish - you cant go wrong with any of them. If theres just one other person with you, you cant go wrong sharing a pizza and a salad. This place is WAY better than Pizzeria Bianco. Will continue to come back here!"
4,I must say that for awhile now I have stayed clear of Subways because of the smell inside the restaurants making you smell just like it when you leave but .... I am completely impressed at how clean and non smelly this store was compared to the ones Ive visited at in Alaska. The employees are freindlier and they didnt pile my pickles in one spot or squirt a huge blob of mayo in a particular spot!  Im not quite sure the names of the 2 guys working tonight but THANKS! I am now a fan of Subway again :-D
5,"It doesnt matter which location you go to, its all the same and GREAT!!!"
1,"This is the worst Pizza Hut I have ever been to. I was up-charged for something I didnt order. When I asked for it to be corrected it was done wrong again, given the wrong change and had the drive thru door slammed in my face. Asked to speak to the manager and he was extremely hostile. He took my change, receipt and food. After some time I asked for a refund and was told that wasnt possible, too much paperwork. Asked for his supervisors number and was told he was the highest manager, there was no one above him. Right.  I went to the next Pizza Hut and asked for the regional manager number. I left the food at the restaurant because I was no comfortable eating it after he took it back to correct their mistake. Not sure what could have been done to it. The young girl at the window did get it wrong twice, but the example the store manager gives is piss poor and is the issue. I hope Pizza Hut sees who they have working for them and speaking on their behalf because according to this store manager, Tim, hes the owner and CEO of the company. I highly doubt that."
5,"They have the friendliest staff at this Whole Foods. They know me by name and always have samples ready for the little boy I nanny before we even walk up to the Deli counter. Maureen the checker, Kathy in vitamins, and Daniel & Paula in the Deli are all exceptional- go see them if you need anything they will be happy to help."
5,"Followed a Dr. that I respect to this practice and I have to say Im pretty impressed. As a long time multi-four-footed caregiver, I have seen more than my share of veterinary clinics and animal hospitals. I know the drill and have seen more than one vacation be sucked in to the great black hole of ""well of course I want  to have the best care"".  The first thing I noticed is that there is NO odor. It doesnt smell like there have been decades of animals paraded through the doors that feel the need to pee as soon as they enter the room... just in case this is their one last shot at leaving something behind.  Then there is the overall feel of the place. The office I used to frequent always had a frenetic sort of feel to it. Files were lost, techs were running, the waiting room was packed with stressed out clients, etc. This office was peaceful. Whether is natural or contrived, I could care less. My dog picked up on it immediately and her normal ""OMG what are we doing HERE?!!"" behavior was replaced with something Ive never witnessed in a vet office before. She was calm!  Its clean! Except for the area around me that was covered in the undercoat that Zoe was stress releasing, there were no traces of other animals.  The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. I had a HUGE file that I was bringing in and they patiently sorted through the entire thing. While I was there for one of my pets, the receptionist offered to set all of them in my household up for me with ""Client Files"" so that I wouldnt have to be bothered in the future. I thought that was a wonderful, time-saving offer and in the event that I ever have to go with an emergency and am not able to focus on paperwork.  Finally, I was in an examination room at the time of my appointment and waited less than 3 minutes for both the tech and the Dr. I was in an out under 1 hour and that my friends is superior service IMHO.  I look forward to a long relationship with Palm Glen and will happily drive the 5 mile difference from my old vet, in order to ensure both my pets and I are treated well!"
3,"Lovely shop, great cupcake selection, friendly service.  But the real question is...how do the cupcakes taste???  Pretty good.  I tried (4) flavors and they ranged from OK to YUMMMMMM!  Vanilla with chocolate buttercream was ok, the Coconut was good (a bit dry, but decent flavor), the Carrot was very good, and the Mocha was YUMMMMMM!   They were all super sweet though.  My husband and I both had a quarter of each flavor and that was more than enough.   From a flavor variety and taste perspective, Sprinkles is a 3.5 - 4.  However, I really cant justify spending $14.00 for (4) cupcakes.  They are expensive so they can pay their overhead and lease costs, not because of exotic ingredients or special decorating skills.  Dont get me wrong, Im sure they use good ingredients, but the wrappers are plain, theres no special piping or fondant work, and the flavors are standard. They are just plain good cupcakes...not fantastic, but good.  Certainly not worth $3.50 a cupcake.  I do a ton of baking and I get special order requests from friends and neighbors all the time.  I always do nice decorating and use premium ingredients and the most I charge is $2.00 a cupcake...and thats only if I use fondant."
5,"my husband and i LOVE this place!  no, we cannot afford to get our weekly groceries here (although it would be terrific if we could), but we view oakville as an excellent alternative to dining out on the weekend.  the food is delicious (think deli, simplicity, quality ingredients), and the atmosphere is comfortable and relaxing! we found that if its too crowded inside, then its easy enough go outside to the awesome patio area to enjoy our beer and goodies :)"
4,"I less than 3 this place. Ive been more than a few and always leave smiling, full, and satisfied. The staff is friendly and fairly fast. I am not sure though how exactly one would determine that rock-a-billies as a whole would love this place. Maybe the grease from the stoves and kitchen floor? However, if you like good food and a fair beer selection this is the place for you. And they have good happy hour drink specials if you like to get really drunk. If you dont mind sitting on an unknown someones lap then lunch rush is probably not a problem for you. Elbow room is the only thing that is lacking here. Of the ones Ive tried so far the porky, lamb vindaloo, chicken tikka masala, and lamb & mint are all pretty darn good. This is making me hungry for a pasty! And the friggin pb & j pasty is incredible!"
5,"Ive been giving a lot of 5-star reviews lately, but (in my opinion) they all deserve it.   Movies on Central RULES.  They have 99.9% of every movie title weve looked for.  Since summer started, weve been in there at least once a week.  Bonus:  they have a water cooler right by the door.  Sweet!"
3,"Im not a huge sushi person (I know, I know...) but I ordered the tuna with lotus chips and it was very yummy. The server was friendly and the chefs were efficient. The atmosphere is dark and modern though a bit squashed and overwhelming."
4,"I had a great experience here and was suprised by how charming and clean the spa is inside, given it is right off of busy rural rd!  I had Lana as my manicurist and she gave a GREAT pedicure.  I used a coupon from the ASU Insiders book and got a relaxing, hour long and hot stone pedicure for $18.  I think the normal price is still around $18...maybe $20 for the cheapest one??!!  Lana was super friendly and sweet, and the owner was also very helpful and made me feel comfortable.  I will definitely go back here for a gel mani!!"
5,"This review is mainly for the bar and a few light (ok not light, but small) snacks.   Met with a couple people during their soft opening and there was absolutely nothing soft about it.  I got there a few minutes early and posted up at the bar to grab a Manhattan.  This drink is usually my boozometer when I am trying a place first.  Ok, weve got something here, this drink is tasty.  Started talking to the bartenders and got a really comfortable feeling from them.  When was the last time that you sit down to the bar and  they ask your name, tell you theirs, and then shake your hand?   After the manhattan the rest of the group showed.  The bar was a little too busy to fit the three of us so I took my second drink, sazerac, to the table.  Sazerac was tasty as well.  Rest of the table ordered some drinks and nothing negative to be said anywhere.  We each had around 4 or 5 drinks and every last one of them was delicious.   We were comped a few bar snack and all were delicious but the stand out was the warm nuts. (twss)  Mixed nuts warmed with Herbs De Provence and a little bit of chili flake I believe.  Soooooo good.   As for the style of the place it is fantastic.  Feels cool but not cliche.  The Palomar staff did a fantastic job of designing this space.  As of now this is the one place in City Scape that is worth while."
5,"This Mexican restaurant has the best burritos in town!  This is not your roach infested 24 hour drive through kind of burrito joint either.  Here are the reasons that make La Tolteca #1 and one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix! 1-Full bakery with mouth watering fresh pastries 2-Fresh ingredients and great prices 3-Also serves beer if you feel like having a Corona with your meal as opposed to take out 4-Little market has the best prices in town on citrus fruits and just enough of everything to cook up a little Mexican meal (Ranch Market not needed!) 5-Make your own pico/ salsa bar, make it your style and get as much of it as you want:) So, if you are downtown looking for authentic Mexican this is the place.  Of course it is super casual take out or seat yourself kind of place so dont  try to flatter your date here! But get there early, Im pretty sure they close up shop by 9 or 10..."
5,"I saw the review below and just thought it was ridiculous. RIDICULOUS.  Elderly people work here or volunteer. You expect customer service that youd receive at a high-end store. No. People die and their things that are usually in good condition are donated and are resold at really cheap prices. No, the people there will not be making sure youre finding everything okay, youre on your own... and thats how it should be when youre thrifting. I usually find great things. Glasswares, books, shoes, purses. They have amazing furniture that is so cheap. They have many half off days and various sales throughout the week. Just make sure you go on a weekday or Saturday and before 2pm.. all the stores in this plaza close at 4 and are closed Sundays."
4,"I still like Lux better. Cartel is very appealing, though, to those who know their coffee. The menu is not huge, but it does offer basic, good drinks.  They have plenty of syrups to flavor your drinks, if thats what youre into. I like the atmosphere in there, and the bike wheel ""art"" is pretty interesting and unique. This place is probably really great to study in, considering the fact that I see a sea of macbook apples every time I walk in here.  The employees are funny and nice. Anyway, it is definitely worth checking out."
4,"Oooh!  A shiny new pizza spot!  I have been told time and time again to try Barros, so the opening of this location was the perfect opportunity to put it to my pepperoni and mushroom test.  All I can say is What Took Me So Long!?  This pizza is GOOD!  Zesty sauce, ample topping coverage and a puffy pillow-like outer crust.  It looks like it would be chewy, but it is not.  How do they do that?  Some sort of pizza alchemy, I am sure. This location is brand new.  The dark wood floors and high-backed booths (that dont yet have butt-indentations from previous guests) are not the typical plastic red/green/white decor what you would expect from a casual pizza restaurant.  The staff is friendly, both on the phone and in person, which is nice.   In addition to fantastic whole pies, they also have inexpensive lunch specials (2 slices and a soda for $4 is my favorite!) until 4pm every day. My only small sadness is that this location does not deliver to my house (even though it is closer than the Barros that does cover my delivery area).  Oh well, I like this one and will probably visit more than is good for me!"
2,Went here about two months ago and am only now getting around to reviewing it. I think that should stand for something in terms of my experience there. The service was ridiculous. If one is going to charge the prices they charge for regular Americanized asian food... at LEAST make sure the menus you hand people are clean. Or your plates for that matter. Or silverware. Seriously! Did EVERYTHING have to be covered in grit or a mysterious sticky substance? Next up... the menu. Not everyone eats meat. How about a little more choices for us who prefer tofu over dead animal? I ordered the Coconut Curry Vegetables. Bland bland bland. Ive had more flavor out of an unseasoned packet of ramen. And would it kill them to actually put some tofu on the plate? I guess I just dont understand the hype. The prices are ridiculous for the quality received. Youre better off going to some little hole in the wall place where the food actually tastes like food and not reheated leftovers.
4,"My favorite trail in South Mountain starts at the trail head just south of 24th st and Baseline.  Its the start of the Mormon Loop and when you connect up to the Mormon Trail/National Trail it extends the hike to about 4 or so miles.  Or at least thats what I have been telling myself.  First part is stair master-esque, then descends very gradually (perfect place to add a run into your hike), then ascends again (catch your breathe) and then gets a bit boulder-y and you can either straight up hike this or run.  If you want, you can take the offshoot to Hidden Valley and Fat Mans Pass.  I wasnt too impressed with either, but it is definitely worth a view and will spit you back out onto the National Trail."
5,"Lived in house for 9 years and just thought was time to replace the carpeting, had used some of those ""$99 room"" services over the years for routine cleaning, met Ray Odom, Owner of Hydro-Pro, and gave them a crack at cleaning the carpets before I replaced them. I was Amazed at results, by the time they were done the carpets looked brand new, took their time and did incredibally throrugh job.  Great service at reasonable price-well worth it. My carpet cleaner from now on."
4,"The main advice I would give anyone interested in dining at Postino Arcadia would be: ""Prepare to Fight.""  Prepare to fight for a parking space and prepare to fight for the bruschetta which is to die for.  My favorites would have to be the Smoked Salmon and Pesto, Apple and Brie, Prosciutto and Fig and Warm Artichoke.  Plus, you cannot beat a bottle of vino and 4 types of bruschetta for $20 every Monday and Tuesday after 8pm! I am also a huge fan of their Pretzel Pub Board and NYC Grilled Cheese that is companied by a Sierra Nevada Mustard, Pesto and Ketchup dipping sauces, washed down with a cold Stella Artois Lager Belgium.  These menu items have sparked inspiration for me to make similar dishes in my own kitchen more than a time or two.  So grab some good company, a bottle of vino paired with bruschetta and prepare for a relaxing-enjoyable night out. Dont forget the Affogato (vanilla bean ice cream topped with espresso) to give ya a jolt for your car ride home."
3,**********This Time We Didnt  Do Carry-Out********** Definitely better ......... when you eat there. This place is like Pei Wei ........VERY LARGE chunks of meat. Vegatables ...... NEVER.......Just like Pei Wei........their priceless. WARNING: Hot Tea is available for $2.00 *********Brown Rice instead of White ......... ALSO $2.00********** The Soups are TERRIBLE.
2,I was excited to eat here after reading the reviews. Then I ate there and I was less excited.  I was prepped for some hot spicy New Mexican food. That did not arrive on my plate. It was tasty for sure but I was lead to believe that I would experience the food I grew up with in New Mexico. I didnt.  It is possible that my expectations were too much for this restaurant to handle.
3,"First off, its fast Chinese, and they lived up to their promise on that one, we did get our dinners fast. I am a huge fried rice fan; and I have to say theirs was horrible, stick to plain white or brown rice. However, I had the beef with broccoli and that was ok. Its not like Beef with broccoli is exploding with flavor anyways, so I can confidently say they didnt mess it up. What I do like about this place (besides how quick our food came out) is that you can do the meal deal , typically only offered at lunch, for dinner which gets you the egg roll and crab puff at dinner. I love crab puffs, again theirs was just ok and I didnt care for the egg roll all that much. Overall it was fast, filled me up with a huge portion that I took home lots of left overs; they were open kind of late - until 10, and it wasnt the worse thing I ever ate. Also, they had very friendly service."
5,"Ive been meaning to try this place for months and Im so glad that the temperature has finally dropped to less than 100 degrees so I could take advantage of the outdoor patio for lunch!  The service was kind of slow..not sure if it was on purpose so I wont knock any stars off for that cause the food was delicious! Got the chicken, goat cheese, bacon, apple, pesto foccacia and would def recommend it. Everything tasted really fresh! A perfect lunch spot :)"
4,"This GB is one of our favorite places to stop for snack and good seasonal beer.  We try for Sundays to do our shopping in the area and stop here....because it is Happy Hour in the bar area all day long.  Great specials on their beers, wine and appetizers.  We have tried several of their appetizers, but you cant beat their garlic fries here!! YUM-O! Anyhow, the service here is always great.  The hostess, bartenders and waitress are always friendly and ready to take your order.  It is especially nice when the weather is beautiful then they open up the patio/bar area.  Great place to watch games...plenty of TVs.  I frequent the Mill Ave. location, because I work in the area and it does not compare to the San Tan GB."
4,"Im a loyal patron of Steves Krazy Subs, so i dont want to get involved in a family rivalry.  However, sandwiches are my business and they deserve a fair critique regardless.  At first approach, Neds is much more of a professional looking sub shop.  Nice large dining area, clean, fancy tables (*more on those in a minute) I was glad to see that Neds had the same lunch special...8 in poorboy, chips and drink.$1 more at Neds, but you get bigger chips.  Tasted exactly the same, so tough to compare.  My only complaint is the booths.  Probably great if you are 65, but for common folk, pretty uncomfy."
5,"I love this place, I want to go to Arizona just to eat here!  The greek fries were really good and different.  It was just really really good.  Were going next time Im in town Fervor!"
4,"I frequent this location before work quite a bit since I start work right around the normal dinner time. Always clean, friendly, and good food. They have real silverware and ""real"" plastic plates! Lol."
4,"This place was unique for me because everyone seemed like they were inside smoking but it was an indoor outdoorish place.  There were heated lights and it was the only place that I found pretty crowded where if you walked the streets there werent a lot of people.   The food was good, I had the steak fajita, which you cant go wrong because its just steak.  But I also had a fish taco which was pretty good.  My boyfriend had the pick three meal, so he picked tacos, chimichanga, and enchilada.  His choice was good and the chimichanga was delish.   The bathrooms were very rustic looking but it seemed to look that way, decent for a funky place like that. They had live music Friday night, where a guy was doing bad covers on a few good songs. The waitstaff was overall nice and they checked back at us here and there. Overall Id go back if I was in around Scottsdale again!"
5,"Absolutely loved this place! My fiance and I came across the Arrogant Butcher while we were in Phoenix celebrating my birthday and our engagement. My fiance had found it on yelp and said ""we must go there for lunch one day"" while we were there. We ended up going here for my birthday dinner, after a ""higher end"" establishment couldnt accomodate my gluten allergy. The food, the drinks and the waitstaff were great! It was so good, we went back the next day!"
2,"A new player in the Downtown Phoenix food scene, Bliss is a creation by the folks behind the Fez, Switch, and Ticoz empire. They occupy a buliding once occupied by Fate and Nine|05, the former of which was one of my favorite restaurants. Entering the restaurant, we were greeted with an odor of mildew and dirty water, which isnt exactly a pleasant way to arrive into an establishment. Being the only ones seated in the small space, we were able to really examine it, and I noticed one glaring difference between the way they have it set up and the way it was set up; it feels like a cafeteria. The installation of florescent lights, heat lamps, and massive amounts of stainless steel in the open kitchen make this place feel like a lunchroom at high school. Whatever, we can deal with it. An overview of the menu showed several options which seemed like drunk food... fried everything, cheese crisps, foot long hot dogs, slider burgers, tacos, grilled cheese, etc. Apparently ""comfort food"" means deap fried grease? NO THANKS. I ordered the Braised Beef Tacos, which had the consistency of paste, but were average in taste.  My biggest gripe with this place is the microwave (not even a turbo chef) sitting front and center in the kitchen. Look, I understand that some restaurants use microwaves (usually not good ones) in their kitchen, especially if its a cold kitchen (which this isnt) but having it in plain view and audible in the dining room is just atrocious. I truly hope someone from the restaurant reads this and hides the thing. It made me completely lose my appetite when I saw them heating my girlfriends rice for her chicken skewers in the microwave. yuck. She did mention she was neutral about her food. We are people who go out at least once a day for a meal and try a new place every time, so we know food.  Everyone we encountered was nice, and the service was very friendly. Everyone seemed interested in how well we enjoyed our meal, the space, and they seemed interested in welcoming us back. Unfortunately, the place looks kind of makeshift on the ReBar side, and like a cafeteria on the Bliss side. Im not really sure why it looks makeshift, perhaps it is just because it looks like a temporary wall in the back of the room, or because it looks so bare, but it looks like they are in there just for the time being.  I feel compelled to go here again but only for drinks out on the patio. The inside looks like Mexico, the food wasnt very good, and the cafeteria/microwave issues pretty much summed up this is not a place for a nice night out dining. I also find it interesting how many reviews are by orange heads or people who were here for the ""vip opening."" cmon, try the place before you write a public review of it, and by try I mean eat some food, and actually experience it."
5,"Soft opening, so still working out the kinks. Food was deelish.  Scallop poppers- crispy and spicy; not at all greasy Honey chicken-a little sticky but so good Teriyaki chicken-subtler than other places teriyaki, but much better flavor and chicken was tender ""tootzi"" roll- bursting with flavor and rolled perfectly Nice touches with cucumber water, upscale Asian decor, unique glasses, menus, plates, etc. Will definitely be back."
5,"The food is EXCELLENT!  We have been 5 times now, and everything we have had has been delicious!  We will continue to dine w Bill and IL Bosco!  The Caprese is AWESOME!"
5,Yum!  The toasted barley app is delicious. My boyfriend and I shared the eggplant sandwich and the monk burger. Both of the sandwiches were outstanding. The service was great too. We will definitely go back.
4,Way over priced but great food
4,"Home to the Mariners and Padres Spring Facilities, Peoria Sports Complex is a pretty great place to take in the action. I have seen a decent number of games here over the years. Most recently I saw a weekend game sitting out on the lawn. It does not get much better than relaxing on the lawn, watching some baseball, hanging out with your friends, and getting some color in the 80 degree heat.  The practical details: (1) there are a TON of food options. Maybe too many, if you believe in such a thing. Food of all kinds is everywhere. You can get all the standard ball park fare and some more exotic things, too, like noodle dishes, sushi, fry bread, etc. (2) Ticket prices are good - sit up close for 20 bucks on down to the lawn for 6 bucks. You cant beat it for getting up close to the action (3) Parking is only 5 bucks in the lot, which I think is really decent, but if you want to walk a little further you could find street parking across the street. BEST DEAL IN THE PARK: $9 for a 32oz. soda with unlimited refills. A large one is $5 and not as big, so if you get even two this is a great deal. On the hot day I was there we filled the sucker up three times and once more before we left. Well worth it. In short, if youre doing the Spring Training thing definitely come to Peoria. Its super relaxed and one of the best places to enjoy some baseball. You will want to keep coming back!"
3,"If I could eat a southwestern Caesar salad once a day, every day, I think I would. This is one of my favorite salads...ever. Paradise in general is a little overpriced but one in a while, Ill bite the bullet and splurge. My only complaint is their lack of vegetarian options. For a restaurant that specializes in soups, salads and sandwiches, it would make sense to have more than one or two options in each category suitable for veggies."
5,"Awesome! I highly recommend this place! Incredible atmosphere inside and out, the bar design is superb and the patio is the perfect spot for relaxing and enjoying drinks with friends. I went for the second time recently and have to give this place a stellar review. The menu is innovative and fresh! The mixed drinks are killer and the wine on tap was an extremely pleasant surprise. Plus, you cant beat their happy hour seven days a week!   I have had the crab cake BLT and the halibut sandwich, which were both out of this world! Everything I saw coming out of the kitchen looked amazing and I cant wait to go back and try all the others.  The servers were great and knowledgeable about their menu which is always a big plus! As a parent, I love that this place is a perfect day/night out spot for a date or hanging with friends but also a family oriented neighborhood joint where I can bring my kiddo along! Love that Churn is right next door to get some yummy dessert after an incredible meal!  The design is spot on for this area! Great job!"
3,"Decaf coffee was the best thing going here. Big cup, super hot and tasty.    White flannel hash was a miss. For me the flavors were off. Too much salt and way too much garlic, for my taste. Service was polite but a bit slow for how empty it was. If you like garlic and a heavy hand with salt, this might be your place."
5,"Found Indulge on a whim, based on their huge ""Gluten-Free Menu"" outside - I was not disappointed when we decided to try it! Indulge has a separate gluten-free menu and the server was very knowledgable walking me through their kitchen processes to reassure me.   I ordered my burger on a gluten-free bun (!!!) the first time I was ever able to do this in a restaurant.  That was EXCITING! I think Indulge is as good as you make it - you are given a menu to check off ingredients for your burger.  They have SOOO many choices, that its likely that if you dont like your burger, YOU made the wrong choice.  I had no such problem - I loved my custom burger!  It was cooked to the correct temperature, was delicious & best of all, was delivered on a tasty gluten-free bun.  PLUS, though I was full (it was a LOT of food!) I was able to take a gluten-free cupcake to go - wow, was that ever heaven later!  Thanks Indulge!"
1,"Totally excited to try this place out, my grandparents, my mom and I (4 of us) came here for some Korean food. It wasnt too busy; just pairs of people from nearby offices coming in and out.  Unlike other Korean restaurants, their lunch special selection is very limited. Special A  consists of a sushi roll with a soda, special B = teriyaki beef/chicken (no soda), or special C, Korean BBQ Spicy Chicken.  As we were looking at the ""lunch special"" board, the lady behind the counter insisted that we should look at their full price menu instead. Here comes the awkward part: she then asked my mom ""are you Chinese?"" Even though she is, my mum looked at me all puzzled as in ""what does that mean?"" The lady proceeded by pointing at the ""seafood pancake"" section on the menu and saying ""I dont know why but you Chinese like this pancake a lot."" Good thing my mom didnt hear what she said.. or else...  So we got the Spicy Chicken lunch special ($6.99), a bulgogi ($6.99), and a beef yakisoba ($7.19). The cool thing about this place is that it has a mini ""kimchi"" buffet bar, with trays of marinated tofu, potato, bean sprout, kimchi, broccoli and some other vegetables. It also has this delicious house special hot sauce.  By the time we finished a dish of kimchi, the food came, so it didnt take long. The spicy chicken, came in a bowl about the size of an instant-noodle bowl (but slightly deeper), was tender, with rice underneath it. The chicken was definitely marinated well; however, the last couple of pieces had tendons and big chunks of fat... what a bad way to end it. The bulgogi also came in a bowl, with rice underneath. The beef was definitely not marinated fully. The color was super light and the beef was close to tasteless. The biggest disappointment, food-wise, was the beef yakisoba. The noodles, occupying most of the Styrofoam lunch box, were sweet. Then there was an ice-cream scoop of rice, topped with 3 pieces, I kid you not, THREE pieces of dog-tag-sized, super-dry meat.  In the end, we just decided to bring the barely-touched yakisoba home for my younger brother (well, teenage boys tend to eat everything...). While my mom transfered the noodles to the plastic bowl (since the Styrofoam box was lidless), I went to ask for a plastic cover. This is the best part: the same lady, stared at me, pointed at the salad bar and said ""you cant take that home"". I thought there was a miscommunication, so I asked again for a lid for the noodles. Again, she pointed at the salad bar and said ""you are not allowed to take the kimchi home"". Wow seriously? Just b/c my grandparents are Chinese you assumed we were stashing kimchi in a bowl and trying to sneak it out? ""Look, I just want to take my noodles home, ok?"" She hesitantly gave me a lid. ""Hey, hey you. we chineness peple no steal kimchi becuz Confucius say no stealing kimchi""... only if I said that to her face... Oh, and when we got home, my brother, aka our food dumpster, took a bite of the yakisoba and never touched it again.   Conclusion: If you want amazing Korean food and friendly customer service, please just go to Chodang. Chodang is WAYYY BETTER, hands down"
1,"One star for the most terrible service in recent memory.  Our server ""DK"" was outright rude and horrible, and outright ignored us when she wasnt making us uncomfortable.   As a former waitress of 14 years, I have the utmost respect, patience and tolerance for my former bretheren - but this woman needs to go.  BAD DK!  Otherwise, our Teppiniyaki (sp?) chef was wonderful, the food was delicious and fresh and a solid four stars.  I have been going to Kyoto since 1995 and it remains a fun and festive place with very reasonable prices.  Too bad it was ruined this time by DK!   DK needs a different job, more suited to her personallity, like euthanizing kittens or something."
2,In my ongoing search for great Chinese food in Phoenix this place is a speed bump
3,"When I came here I got half a dozen donuts and one of those boba drinks. The donuts were really good, but I wouldnt say they were any better than a Dunkin Donuts or Krispy Kreme. The boba drink was so good though! Im really happy they have those. :)"
4,"Daahhling, Ill have a gin and tonic. If you dont feel fabulous here, then you dont have any imagination.  I love the decor, its fun to hang out here and have drinks at night. Ive also had breakfast here before too, it was pretty good and certainly a different feel from the saucy evening there before, but it still had the same effect on me, that I was ab-fab.  Hanging out by the pool is fun too, smaller than I thought it would be though. (thats what she said)"
3,"Great bar with a friendly bartender named ""Bob"""
4,"Very much my kind of a place, it reminded me of the places in Europe/Berlin that I loved so much. Its like a house setting & on the days that we went they had a live band playing great fusion stuff in the back rooms. Their Beer collection is amazing of course, one of the few places in Phoenix with such a huge beer collection."
5,"My roommate came home the other night with a Chocolate Cream pie and oh. my goodness! It is AMAZING! The crust is this wonderful crunchy chocolately wonderfulness. I think she bought a Groupon and I dont know how much she paid but the pie was so good, regardless of full price, Im sure its worth it!"
5,"These little sliders are tasty, delicious and pretty speedy.  You get two and you can get them with or without grilled onions.  There is a home made type thousand island dressing on them that adds so much to these wonderous burgers!   Fries are 5 star as well...also enjoy the people watching...Scottsdale at its finest!"
3,"I havent been to a Sweet Tomatoes location in well over 3 years. I have never been to this location before, but the service was good. The selections havent changed that much. I was pleased to see they had strawberry muffins with strawberry butter. YUMMY! The salads are still fresh and good. I wish they had more non dairy alternatives there."
5,"DECEMBER 2012:They still have the ANGRY WHOPPER!!!!! Best whopper EVER. Mine goes no lettuce, heavy onion, heavy tomato, and BBQ sauce on the bottom bun. Its THICK. 55 year anniversary --- second whopper 55 cents! DEAL!!! Really, have you ever had a BAD whopper? :)"
4,"Sheraton Desert Oasis is a great value in the late spring/early summer to get away for a few days and relax.  It is part of the Starwood Hotel Chain, but this is one of their first forays in to the recent boom in Hotel chains opening time share residences for sale under their brands. So this was meant to be property that was sold in timeshares, which some have. mostly for winter weeks for cold snow birds. But in the low season, which is summer, you can get a room for around $100. And what do you get? You get a nicely appointed, decorated model home, about a 700 square foot 1 bedroom apartment. It is repleat with 2 gas fireplaces, full kitchen with all wares and utensils, living room, patio with table and chairs, his/her bathroom sinks, a marbled tiled shower, a king size bed and a heart shaped large jacuzzi bathtub in the bedroom.  It has a full social and activities calender, so it is a good place to take the kids. There is a large clover shaped pool, with multiple water fountains, and a large rocklike island structure with caves where the jacuzzi is located. There are about 75 chaise lounges and several tables, so there is usually one available for you. There is also a poolside grill for food and beverages.  You are not far from the restaurants and nightlife of North Scottsdale, near Kierland Commons Mall, Desert Ridge Mall, 101 Mall, and about 6 other strip and big box shopping centers. You can buy food and easily eat in to save some money. The famed Tournament Players Club (TPC) gold course is close by, as well as the more exclusive and expensive Fairmont Princess hotel.  This is more of a vacation home than an exclusive resort with people waiting on you hand and foot. But it is well maintained, nicely appointed, and a relaxing getaway. Peak season (winter) rates are $325 and up, so if you come in early summer, you get a bargain and a tan by the pool."
3,"I came here with me sister Cher, who really likes this place. Im so used to food being prepared by cooks and brought to me. So, Im not used to having to prepare my own food via restaurant. I love to cook from recipes, so why should this be any different, right?  As we arrived there wasnt that many people, I was relieved and allowed me to ask my sister 101 questions about what to do. I ended up making a concoction of beef, carrots, broccoli, rice noodles, sprouts with chefs favorite sauce. It turned out good but I know that I was missing something. I tried some of my sisters bowl and that was really good. So, this place is a build-your-own bowl, piled high if necessary, and watch it cook right in front of you. It was a little overwhelming at first, but if I continue to go there, I will get accustomed to the process."
4,"The Capistrami is the best thing ever.  Hot pastrami, swiss cheese, cole slaw and a russian dressing.  Im addicted to this sandwich, but of course, there are worse vices.  This sandwich screams eat me even when Im completely full.  Its okay, the pain I feel later is justified by how amazing it tasted earlier.  They have a good selection of chips and also make fresh baked cookies.  Service is on par.  Love it.  If I had to pick one gripe, the bread could probably be a little bit better, but thats minor in light of how great the food is here."
4,"A definite welcome to the neighborhood!!  I was delightfully surprised at how much the store offers in such a small space. Grant it you are not going to get many choices on some items, but you may be surprised at some of the items you do find. There were plenty of choices for organic foods and ""green"" products, also.  The good: convenience - for those of you that has one in your neighborhood. Easy to get in and out of with front door parking. PRICE - The prices are as low as Walmarts but without the hassle of having to deal with the super-store size. (they accept coupons too - even better)  Ready meals - Great concept. Many places do this, but I found that it was easy (and fun) to create a full meal. Main courses, salads, sides, sandwiches and desserts all labeled and located in one place. If you dont have time to cook give it a shot. It is not as cheap as cooking it yourself but lasagna for two people for six bucks isnt bad.  The bad: Stay away from the Rotisserie Chicken. A little dry and over-cooked. Ive had better at Frys, Costco. Save your tastebuds. In a world of Mega-stores with mega-parkiing lots it is nice to have a place that is actually cheaper to go to and within walking distance.  The best way to describe Marketside is if you were to cram the Walmart food section and the Wholefoods quality and organic cool factor  in a space the size of Walgreens."
4,"Old Town Tortilla Factory does a fantastic job with Mexican/New Mexican cuisine.  The chicken pinwheels that were supposedly featured on the Food Network or something are phenomenal.  Theres a good variety of entrees featuring different types of seafood and meat, and plenty of southwest flavors.  The margaritas, served with a little shaker of extra, are excellent too.  My mom actually drank a whole one, which, maybe you dont know my mom, but, trust me, is saying something.  The ambiance out on the patio (when its not too hot outside) is quite comfortable and cozy, with the fountain and the strings of lights.  Also, they have homemade flavored tortillas, with different flavors featured daily, but sometimes the waitstaff doesnt seem overly eager to give them out.  Had to deduct one star for service.  Other than that, I highly recommend this place."
4,"Sorry Jesse had such a bad experience here.  I have been using this place for about, well,  from the week they opened as it is so close to my office. They have never lost or damaged any of my clothing, and I drop my wifes delicate stuff off here as well for dry cleaning.  They have also always been true to their word on when I can pick up my clothes - although I am usually days late on the pick-up (one benefit of being a clothes-horse I guess).  Two doors down from Dunkin, so fantastic to drop and pick the rags and then grab a cup ojoe before hitting the office.  The women who work there arent too hard on the eyes, either, which is always a plus. Hard to believe they are still using a dot matrix printer, but that has no impact on service."
4,This is one of my favorite dive mexican places in Phoenix.... the place it pretty clean for a mexican place despite the shady looking outside.  Everytime that i have been there i always get the lunch specials... they are a ton of food and cheap (5 to 7 bucks for a large plate)...  The staff is very friendly and they get you in and out in a hurry... i have never been here for dinner... and not sure if i want to... i like being in that area during daylight hours.
5,"Falafel is outstanding here, dark exterior with green interior, and a nice spicy peppery taste that is satisfying.  Cooked just right too for texture.  Fries are a nice side.  Prices reasonable here, plenty of parking, and a few atypical sodas available in the fridge.  Note that theres just a few seats inside, since this is also a grocery place.  To-go will probably be my main strategy for this great Falafel destination."
5,"this place rules, plain and simple just wish they had a cheaper jukebox"
4,The margarita pizza is awesome. They use a delicious red sauce that I would be happy to eat on noodles- much different than a lot of pizza places that just use a tasteless red goo. Good crust too! The organic root beer is pretty gross though.
4,"Im not a fan of Thai food or buffets but this place is great. Food is great and it very decently priced! Its not super busy, so the food isnt always ""fresh out of the kitchen"" tasting, but I really enjoy the Pink Pepper!"
3,Pricey!!  Not my fave place to shop for vintage wares but decent to peak through.
5,"Stay in the courtyard recently and have no complaints at all!! RIght when I entered the place , the staff greeted us and they were all very nice and helpful with everything. Although i only stayed there for 1 night , i thought the rooms were very well kept and the bed was amazing! The first thing i do when i check into the room is look at the bed and sample how if feels and this bed was amazing! The rooms are about normal size and has a tv , desk , chair , etc..... Wifi is also a must whenever i travel and no complaints here. Wifi was fast and easily available. Did not have a chance to see the gym or the pool but they do have one. Overall , i would stay here again if i come by Phoenix!!"
4,"Live music, plenty of beer on tap, and a very happening place.  This place was packed with people however with a group of 6 we still found tables and chairs.   I enjoyed some beers on tap, but wanted to try some food so we ordered the Copper Blues Burger.  Very good burger, fresh tasting and the bacon and cheddar hit the spot.  The fries are good, which I normally do not eat at all.   Nothing like enjoying a nite out with friends.  Live music, great food, and plenty of drinks and beers on tap to enjoy.  We all had a great time out.  Service was great and everyone seemed pretty friendly there.  Great atmosphere here."
4,"out of the three filipino restaurants in Mesa i think this is the best, lots of choices in the food, and the cantelope drink is a must have.  the portions are really good, and price is very reasonable.  i took my friends there last week and they liked it.  only thing i ask the cook though is too go a little easier on the grease, but than again it wont be a filipino dish if there werent grease oozing out of it  lol"
2,"This review is for the chain in general. The location we went to is new so it isnt in Yelp yet. Once it is I will put this review there as well. We were there on Friday at 5 PM.  The reason I gave it 2 stars is because the burger was very good and it was made the way I asked for it. My husbands burger was not. But, the server and the fries left a lot to be desired. Let me preface by saying that we had been to several other locations. I like my fries crispy. I ask for them well done, extra crispy, scorched, tortured hollow tubes. Whatever their buzz word is for well done. The location will comply. EVERY OTHER 5 GUYS HAS COMPLIED. But not the one at TATUM AND SHEA. She said that corporate said they are not to cook the fries that way. So if we were to put up with soggy fries - yes soggy, then we did not want them.  She also interrupted us several times which is rude. THEN she went and called corporate just to double check for us and she came to the table and said they said no they were not to cook them that way. Seriously? We did not ask for her to do this. She actually accused us of being undercover shoppers. We started to say something and then again- she interupted. Listen, if you explain that our choice is not how the company wishes to present their product and we still choose to have them a different way, you should comply. It is after all our money and our decision. I was raised with the rules that #1 the customer is always right. And #2 if the customer is wrong REFER TO RULE NUMBER 1!! We will not return. They have lost our business and I hope she loses her job. If you want to try a really good burger AND FRIES place- go to Paradise Valley Burger Company at 40th Street and Bell. You will not be disappointed."
3,"Went here last night with another couple for dinner.  The pitcher of margaritas was spot on, the chips were outstanding along with the guacamole and salsa.  I ordered the tortilla soup which I ended up sending back cuz to be honest it tasted and looked like a bowl of enchilada sauce.  My husband ordered the filet and enchilada which I have to say was cooked perfectly and definitely would order if I ever went back.  The other couple ordered the beef short ribs which I didnt taste but they both agreed it was over cooked. Service was great but when I have to send something back which I rarely do I cant give more then 3 stars."
4,"today was my second visit to the gyro house. i was craving something mediterranean and remembered this place isnt too far from work. located in a nondescript ... no, thats not the right word ... rundown ... nope, thats still not quite right ... ok, completely ghetto, half empty strip mall that also houses a chinese restaurant and a second hand clothing store, the place does not look promising from the outside.  inside, there are 15 or so tables, comfortable molded plastic chairs and an extensive menu to choose from. everything on the menu is fairly priced with the most expensive being ""dinner for 2"" at $21.95. fountain drinks are $1. sandwiches ($5.95 - $6.95) are served with fries. i had the homemade falafel on a pita with super secret spices, fresh lettuce and tomato (and onion, but i picked that out) and it was yummy! french fries were hot, crispy and unsalted. i prefer them that way ... this way i can salt to my hearts content. anyway, the place isnt fancy, but it is fresh and clean, family owned and serves up some really good food. if you dig fancy, look no further than the back of the restaurant where they sell some pretty fancy-schmancy hookahs, and prices look fair to boot! so there you have it ... homemade falafel, french fries and fancy hookahs. what could be better? to me, not much. gyro house has earned a solid 4 stars from me."
4,"My man took me to Fuego for a pre-birthday meal on a Wednesday night. I was surprised to see how many diners were there a. Because its a Wednesday and b. Because its in such an odd spot!! Once you get past the randomness of its location, you will see how quaint and homey feeling it is. The two servers working the front of the house were friendly multi-taskers who welcomed, advised and fetched drinks while we decided on, then waited for our meal. We started with the scallop app and agreed that it was great, although small (3 scallops/$13). How bout one more tasty morsel? Apparently, it was small to save room for the hulking entrees we graciously received next! Wow! I had the seared ahi-a huge portion of it spicily seasoned, lightly seared, and great tasting! The man had the stuffed chicken breast, and inhaled it. It looked great as well. Also in the ""great"" category were the side dishes! Omg, the cheddar massed potatoes were so freaking scrumptious I could die! I also had the jalapeño creamed corn, that I mixed with the potatoes to make a combo from heaven! Man got the green chile cornbread casserole, which sounded meh, but tasted incredible! Such a fantastic meal! Stuffed with amazing food, and pampered by attentive servers, I was disappointed that I couldnt give Fuego 5 stars. But it wouldnt be prudent.  Why, you ask?  Because the sangria sucked. I had both the white, that tasted like watered down kool-aid, and the red, that tasted like old, cheap red wine mixed with coke a cola. They both sucked. Not good. Hopefully it was an off night, beverage-wise and I just happened to be there for it. Everything else was spot-on!"
5,"Wow... i dont think Ive ever been in a more narrow place.. ever!  but it was just perfect in ever way!!!  They have tables along one side and a bar with tall stools along the other side... you can watch them make your food....  its like the food network... but live and you can smell it :)  my coworker and i sat right in front of the oven... every time they would open the oven i would only get hungrier!! :) we could see all the fresh and yummy ingredients!!  i had the Reuben (Pastrami, corned beef, homemade sauerkraut and Swiss with a side of 1000 island dressing)  WOW... it was amazing... for their sauerkraut they use red cabbage... it was more sweet than bitter... and the crust of the pasty was flaky and buttery... so delicious!! and i honestly forgot how much i love corned beef! over all it was very rich... but great to share....  My Coworker had the Italian.. (pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil, tomatoes and marinara sauce) it looked great... he loved it... you could see the fresh basil and tomatoes... it smelled divine  we didnt speak for a full 20 minutes... just barley loud enough mmmmmmmms and o-m-g this is amazing... said quietly to ourselves....  all of the employees were so outgoing and laid back at the same time... just really cool guys... i loved the atmosphere and the attitudes that filled this place...  i cannot wait to come back!"
5,Love love love this place. Its a very healthy place to eat and always has awesome food and awesome service!
4,"Who woulda thunkkkk Scottsdale, AZ would have such amazing soul food??! They surprised the hell outta me! Coming from someone who regulars Roscoes chicken &waffles... believe me when I say LOLOs is BOMB!!!  I got the 3chicken combo... w greens, mac&cheese &cornbread.   Cornbread.. hands down Roscoes! Greens... Roscoes Mac&cheese... LOLOs for suuuree! Chicken... tied.. theyre both really good! the staff is super friendly!! cant wait to go back when i visit AZ. (="
5,"I found Cake Frenzy through an service listing on Craigslist while looking for someone to create our wedding cake/cupcakes. Not only were we on a tight budget we only had about 2 1/2 months to plan for the venue we wanted only had a few dates available. I met Jennifer about a month prior, my fiance and I knew we wanted a peanut butter & jelly cake and she happily obliged. I emailed her a picture of what I wanted and the day of our wedding when I first saw our cake I almost cried. She went above and beyond my expectations. The cake was beautiful with sugar flowers and gelatin butterflies. All of our guests loved the flavor combinations and the decorations. I highly recommend Cake Frenzy, she is professional, she takes pride in her work and extremely reasonable."
1,"Maybe their dogs are better, but breakfast sandwiches at Nathans are disgusting! The English muffin was spongy, the eggs greasy, the bacon undercooked... And all premade and wrapped ready to melt together into mush with the cheese. Yuck!!!"
5,"Yes, please! This place is AMAZING! I brought my family here after coming many times, and everyone LOVES IT! The wasabi mashed potatoes are KILLER! I HIGHLY recommend. I really dont know if there is anything to avoid at this place. Just love it every time! We have tried many dishes, and they are always flavorful and fabulous."
3,"The food is good, atmosphere a little strange, and the prices a tad high for what you get.  Got a sandwich and a salad.  The sandwich was good, but it was just that, a sandwich.  No accessories.  The salad was also good, but it could have really used a meat on top.  You had the option, but the salad was already a bit pricey to begin with and adding meat would have made it over a $10 salad...for lunch."
4,"I really like this place! Plenty of room, very organized. And is willing to help you out. Price is very acceptable @ $7.00 a day. They have ear plugs, targets and beverages to purchase at a reasonable price. If its your first time there is a 10 min video they want you to watch. Its diffidently a great place to go, just have to watch out for dumb A$$ like myself. I tend to have a major brain freeze. But the workers there are nice enough to let me know what I did wrong in a polite way. Give me time! I promise I wont shoot anyone! Ill get better."
5,"I love sprinkles cupcakes. I have also managed to go to every location except the 3 in so cal. Like every location, the taste and quality is consistent and delicious. I got the salt caramel, banana, and carrot this time around. Like always, its delicious and lasts for as long as they say it does. My pup loves the pupcakes too. I would wait for these cupcakes any time."
5,"Bookmans is Great!  They probably dont need another positive review but so what.  I use Bookmans for recycling books Ive read and for buying used books for myself.  All I can say is that I like everything about the way they do business.  They have great people working there.  The store vibe is very positive.  Their prices are very fair and what they pay for your used books is incredibly fair, plus you know that youve made a positive contribution to our society by recycling books that others can enjoy.  Do yourself a favor and stop in.  Enjoy!"
4,"This place is a little pricey- but you get what you pay for. Johannas flow class is great. The only con I have is that classes can be packed, they dont offer tons of early morning classes- but this is the best place in the valley, by far, for yoga."
4,"If you work in an office and have to dress business casual, NY & Co is your place to shop. Some of their stuff can be a bit plain but more often then not, they have modest, cute, stylish, business casual clothes at an affordable price. I dont think I have ever been bugged by a salesperson when coming to this store which is actually kinda nice. I cant stand salespeople following me around chiming in about how cute something is (see my review on Coach in LV). Lastly, they have a great display of accent jewelry which is my weakness. Everything is always really different and fun so I cant resist and usually walk out with several pieces. The next time you are trying to find a place to shop, try NY & Co. There is something for everybody   :)"
4,"Really cool, foodie restaurant in scottsdale. All the food was fresh and original. The service was quick and pleasant, and definitely a place to consider to eat. Its not the cheapest restaurant but worth the price. This place definitely belongs in Scottsdale as is more upscale and you could sense it from the decor and service."
4,"Went there to photograph a concert. Great crowd and fun quirky locals. Loved the dive bar ambience without being trashy/dirty. The lighting for the show wasnt great but the sound was good. Great beers, too. Get the 99Shillings."
5,"Nooooooooo!  Curse the the gods of all that is delicious, for Huauchinango is now CLOSED.  Replaced by some generic grill that offered us some nachos and quesadillas, thanks for that.  So not only did you replace a great eatery, but you also had to throw in a little bit of extra salt in the wound.  So, I dont think Ill be giving my business to the devil grill anytime soon.  Huauchinango, you shall now only be a distant whiff of habanero al pastor memory. You shall be missed."
5,"I ate here once while Crudo was still in its Scottsdale location.  And I raved about it and vowed to come back (although the strange location in a salon delayed that return).  Then Crudo disappeared.  And I wondered how a place that fed me one of my best meals in Phoenix could disappear in a town supposedly full of foodies.  Now it has reappeared, and in a better location.  Oh joy."
4,"Ive been going to this Costco location since I was a tyke, when it used to be called Price Club, and my parents carted me around in their giant warehouse sized shopping carts (Those were the days, and those huge carts were the coolest to sit in!).  The employees here are nice and friendly for the most part, and there are employees I see when Im here that I remember from when I was in junior high, a testament to the happiness of the staff here if theyve been at this location for so long."
4,"Upon suggestion of the ""Scottsdale Native,"" I landed here one night for dinner. This place is part of Fox Restaurant Concepts group who is also responsible for Culinary Dropout, Wildflower, Modern Steak, Zin Burger, Sauce, Montana Avenue, Bloom among others.  ATMOSPHERE: Awesome. Very happening, trendy with mostly young professional and older folks. Huge place with big open space. Great for groups with long table seating either booth or traditional table or couch. The wall opens up to the outdoor patio where you can sit on couches.  We sat inside since it was a bit chilly. FOOD: Latin/Mexican inspired menu. Huge portions! 1. Complimentary chips/salsa - didnt have any chips as I like to usually eat my salsa by spoon since its lower calorie that way. Good flavor, nothing spectacular. Wish it were a bit more chunkier.  2. Fish tacos - the Native and I split this dish and it was brought out split for us. It was like 2 entrees! Im glad we split this since it was a ton of food. The dish came with rice, pinto beans (choice of black beans as well). Mini fish tacos (4) with grilled fish, avocado, pico de gallo. Very yummy. Always a fan of the grilled food even though it increases your colon cancer risk.  3. Crab and shrimp ceviche - containing cucumber, avocado, radish. Nice flavors. Not memorable however so there not much to write here..... simply because I cant remember..... I know it wasnt bad though. SERVICE: No complaints here. Attentive enough. PARKING: Private lot. No problems finding a spot. CONCLUSION: I think I would come here again more for the atmosphere but food is good too!"
4,"Great cleaners, open weird hours, always polite to me, anyhoo."
1,Ok Im very surprised by the reviews on here. Im not one to want to write negative  reviews but our food was so bad I couldnt help myself. Maybe this place was having an off night tonight but their pizza barely had any cheese on it and the crust was soggy. Unfortunately the pizza was better than the wings that were overly breaded and soggy as well. Thank God we had a groupon and didnt have to pay full price. Wont be ordering from here again. Disappointing :(
1,Got a padi and the tech stopped for a while to eat. then i got a new tech to finish my pedi. my total was different than the quoted price. when paying my total was $25 i hanede them a $50 and they cashier tried to keep all the change for a tip. he refused to give me my change until i told him that is not gon to happen. My feet were so dry afterwards. I DO NOT recommend them
5,"I have totally fallen in love at Tuck Shop.  Everything here is fantastic.  My friend and I come here about twice a month and enjoy some snacks and wine.  The beer battered Cheese Curds may just change your life for the better... we are seriously tempted to each get our own order.  (I am not very good at sharing and i always get what I want!   ...No im not an only child... well, maybe I was until i was 11, how did you know.  WAH!)    Oh, and Laura is fantastic.  She always takes great care of us as we enjoy a glass of wine on the couch in the reading room.   Thursdays special is meat loaf... dont deny yourself, just indulge.  :)"
2,"Not impressed. Start with the service. Not professional. It seemed as though the wait staff was clueless as to the table numbers. We were given the wrong tables order twice.  Second, the food was conceptually a mess. No clear theme or flavor profiles. The food was heavy, greasy and took forever to arrive. None of the dishes were memorable.  Third, the wine selection seemed to be lacking. And, the sommelier didnt know where the wine was from she was serving. Not impressed."
4,"Theyve gotten better and better for me in the time since this review was written.  My last contact with them was a few days ago when I was having trouble redeeming some Groupons on their website. I called customer service and after waiting a few minutes I spoke with a rep who cheerfully booked four separate flights for me, patiently and manually entering my Groupon info for each one. I think the acquisition by Republic has helped them overall. After Republic took over the in-flight cookies started. It still tends to suck if you arent Ascent club (like just about any budget-centric airline does), but once you get there its a good value. When Ive had to fly Southwest or USAir Ive been disappointed in comparison."
5,"My girlfriend i love, love, love this place. Excellent food, beers, and wine to enjoy on premises.   Friendly, helpful, and funny staff.  A wonderful grocery to shop from, and an amazing selection of cheese and wine.  Its a total foodie destination.  This place is fantastic.  Ahwahtukee (and Phoenix in general) needs more quality driven, food and wine centric places like this."
5,"Where else can you go in Chandler the will transport you to another country for free in a flash!! I like to shop here and explore the foods of other countries.  This is not just an Oriental Supermarket, they are a World Market.  Each aisle jets you to a different culture or country. I wish most of all their sake selection was better but oh well, they are bound by the limitations of their distributors. I will be there again soon for a mini-staycation!!!!"
5,"Inside the Clarendon Hotel in central Phoenix, Gallo Blanco has quickly made a hit for themselves with hipsters and urban dwellers alike. They offer a refreshing alternative for hotel restaurants, with lively ambiance and great food and drink. Gallo Blancos tacos are surefire hits. Theyre served individually, and come lined up in an appealing silver taco stand. Weve ordered the carne asada and shrimp soft tacos, and, wow, theyre really mouthwatering. The shrimp is flame grilled and seared, bringing out a nice full flavor. The guacamole is slightly sweet and chunky, and paired with outstanding tortilla chips, this is a must-order appetizer. Even the sauces (I prefer the red chipotle one) are addictive, either to accompany the supreme tacos, or to be enjoyed alone on chips. This restaurant is a fine addition to the emerging downtown Phoenix foodie scene, and with prices extremely reasonable, you get a lot. A good sized meal for two (sans drinks) could ring up at $30-35, which is a good value for great food. Try Gallo Blanco, bring friends, and get a bunch of items. Although I havent explored the rest of the menu, I sense that Gallo Blancos items dont stray far from excellence."
3,"I have been to the original Vig and was happy to see that they were opening the Vig Uptown within walking distance of mi casa.  So far, Ive only been able to schlep over on weekends for brunch.  Ill say that the food is good, but the service on my last trip was pretty lacking.  At one point, my BF & I sat for nearly 20 minutes between the coffee delivery and the actual order taking.  That seemed to be the standard for the day in what was a pretty empty restaurant.  kept me from giving that 4th star for sure."
1,"No no no...do not go here, now Im not talking about the fact that the place looks crappy, or the bathroom is suspect but the fact that the food is nasty. It was completely empty when we were there and that should have been some indication on what to expect but no I am a glutten for punishment. I ordered some tacos and didnt even finish the meal I ended up just tossing the food and still got a tummy ache from what little I did eat. This place is definitely not a good look"
1,"I dont think I have ever been to a restaurant where I have treated so poorly by the wait staff. Im actually rethinking my Green rating because I sincerely think this is my worst restaurant experience. The one good thing I can write is that this place is really cute and it has an inviting patio. Lots of string lights and cute bistro tables. I really thought I was in for a great evening. Oh how wrong I was. My friend and I walked in and the hostess immediately sat us at a four top right in front of the door. Unless the restaurant is packed and the drafty table in front of the door is the last spot available, I do not want to sit in a place where incoming guests will constantly bump into my chair. I pointed to a seat in the back and after trying to convince me I didnt want *that* table, the hostess led us to the back. Its not the worst thing that could ever happen and that instance did not ruin my evening, it was just weird. We sat and were greeted by our waitress, who initially seemed very nice. We both ordered water to start and I asked her for a drink menu. Apparently the drink menu is on the back of the regular menu. Its just so small that I missed it the first time. She told me that Friday night is the $4 frozen house margarita night, so I went with her suggestion. By the time I finish pulling out my ID, my dining partner was ready to order. We got a queso appetizer, the vegetarian tacos with a side salad, and the machaca plate. While we waited, a few more groups came in, were greeted, and received their adult beverages. It had been ten minutes since I ordered my drink, so I tried to look for our waitress.  She finally popped up five minutes later, but avoided all eye contact with our table. When she did see me, she quickly ran outside. I understand she might have had a few tables outside, but why have an inside section to wait as well? The table right next to us had an amazing server who brought them two orders of drinks in the time it took to get my water glass refilled. (Margarita was still MIA at this point.) Then, the queso came out, brought by two hipsters. It looked like an over-microwaved styrofoam plate in a skillet and tasted just as bad. My friend tried to make the best out of the situation, but I was ready to call the manager. I really, really regret that I did not.  Nasty queso juice dripped all over the table and there was no silverware or napkins to be found. AND no wait persons or a hostess to ask for said items. (Twenty minutes after I ordered my margarita, it was still MIA.) Our waitress finally popped up and asked how the appetizer was. My friend cut me off and said it was different, but okay. He took rare this opportunity to ask for silverware. The waitress made an excuse that it should have been on the table already and went to grab some.  When she came back, I asked about my drink. With another lame excuse that could have been avoided if she ever check on us in the then-thirty minute absence, she finally brought me my drink. It was OKAY, not worth $4... more like $2-3.  Two seconds later, the food came out. At least we had silverware? 1) My veggie tacos and side salad were okay. Is it bad that the BEST part of meal was the white, iceberg lettuce salad? 2) My friends machaca was bone dry. Isnt machaca supposed to be tender, rehydrated, and edible?  All in all, the salsa was the best part of the meal. Yet, one cannot enjoy a dining experience on salsa alone. This was sincerely my worst experience at a restaurant and I will not go back to Mucho Gusto."
5,"Being from San Antonio I missed Rudys so much! This Arizona location is similar, but different. The BBQ is definitely a winner, but their now commercialized packaged BBQ sauce is horrible! Bring back the other stuff in the Styrofoam containers! I will still keep coming for the brisket when Im in the area!!!!!"
4,"I dont have much to compare it to, since this is the only Venezulan restaurant I know of in AZ.  Its very small, definitely family-run, with what looks to be the adolescent son taking orders and bringing out drinks.  The young man who seems to be the owner shares the space with Rosatis.   My foodie group saw a write-up of this place in the newspaper so we decided to trek out to Mesa.  It was pretty darn good, especially for the price! They were out of Guayanes (the newspaper had recommended this arepa) so we ordered three other arepas.  In case you dont know, an arepa is a corn fritter type sandwich.  We had the queso de ano, which appeared to have a salty cheese and potato in it.  It was very yum.  We had reina pepiada arepa, which was  like a mayonaise-y chicken salad with avocado- we didnt care that much for it.  But the Pabellon arepa with fried plantain, shredded beef, and black beans was a hit. We also had the pabellon plate which was quite yummy with the best fried plantains Ive ever had.  Oddly, the rice was a bit hard and dry. The cachapas jamon and queso de mano was a favorite with my fellow foodies- kind of like a pancake sandwich with ham and cheese.  We finished with the quesillo (tastes exactly like flan to me) which was very good. Id say its a bit of a drive for some of us, but its definitely worth checking out.  Not for those looking for heart-healthy eats!"
4,I went here for a birthday party it was a group of 9 and everyone got good service. It was good in taste but more expensive than some of the ones that were closer to me in Mesa. I would go back but only as a group. If you are closer to this place than say Sushi Ave go here you wont be dissappointed.
4,"Some pretty decent mexican food, and quiet cheap as well. $5 for a burrito, though its not as big as the $6/$7 burritos or taste as good as the ones in San Jose, CA, it was still good. if I was from here, Id probably come here a lot.. maybe a little too much though. I tried an Arizona Burrito, which was potatoes, cheese, and steak burrito. Pretty good, though the potatoes seemed a little too hard, but it was whatever. Just tasty greasy food, my brother said its the perfect hangover food, and they are open late so :)."
2,"I was really looking forward to eating here because I had read good reviews. Maybe we went on a bad day. They were very slow but it took way too long to get our food and they screwed up my friends order. I got a chicken, carne asada and fish taco. The Chicken was the best. I didnt care for the carne asada or the fish. Guedos fish tacos are far superior. I dont think that we will return to Elmers with all the great Mexican food choices in the area. Sorry."
3,"Had lunch at the Burger Studio yesterday. I always get nervous when there are not too many people in the restaurant at lunch or dinner. Usually a sign of some sorts.  Ordered the Studio Burger and I thought onion rings (felt like I was down a quart of oil). What seemed like a long time to receive my food, I was unhappy to see fries instead of onion rings. Oh well.  The hamburger extended over the bun which is always a good sign for a custom product. I was impressed with the bun as well, not a flat, stumpy bun but a high top with a nice sheen. It was delicious and the fries were good as well. Owner stopped in we greeted at which point I told him about the fries/onion rings and he immediatly comped me an order. They came out and looked very oily. Distictive beer batter flavor. Not that good....stick with the fries which are great.  Overall....great tasting burger and fries and compared to the other guys (Zin, The Grind, Smash Burger) I put it right up there and a lot less expensive."
5,"When I say a certain food contains ingredients such as blue cheese and bacon, what comes to mind? No, Im not talking about a salad, Im talking about an ice cream sundae! Sweet Republic is an awesome little ice cream parlor located in a strip mall in Scottsdale, Arizona. This amazing place makes all their ice creams and sorbets in house. Sweet Republic makes some pretty creative flavors. These are just a few examples of what we sampled: Basil Lime Sorbet Salted Butter Caramel Apple Pie Dessert Honey Maple Pecan Almond Buttercrunch Cashew Turtle All of these flavors were wonderful but there was one more that really got me all hot and bothered, and that was their Honey Blue Cheese. Thats right, Blue Cheese ice cream. When I first saw it, I did not know what to think but after my first lick I was hooked. It tasted just like a sweet vanilla / honey ice cream with blue cheese crumbles mixed into it. I know it sounds weird but this ice cream is phenomenal. It was sweet, tangy and somewhat salty, all at the same time. Instead of just enjoying this ice cream alone I decided to make my own blue cheese sundae. They have many toppings to choose from, including bacon brittle. When all was said and done my creation contained two scoops of their Honey Blue Cheese ice cream topped with a salted caramel sauce, bacon brittle and a homemade marshmallow that was toasted with a blow torch. This sundae was exploding with flavor. Every bite was crunchy, salty, sweet, tangy and delicious.  My fiancé had a waffle cone sundae that contained Salted Butter Caramel ice cream, Almond Buttercrunch ice cream, salted caramel sauce, brownie bites and a homemade marshmallow. Hers was also amazing. The service and prices here were both great. The girl working the night we visited allowed us to sample as many flavors as we wanted and was really friendly and patient with us. The prices here are similar to  Coldstones.  Im absolutely in love with Sweet Republic and would seriously make a special trip to Scottsdale just to have their ice cream. I shouldnt be telling you all this, for fear that you all would think Im a pig but I liked their Honey Blue Cheese ice cream so much that after I finished my sundae I ordered a Honey Blue Cheese milkshake to go. It was so yummy!"
4,"Dont let the name deceive you. Beaver Choice is an EXCELLENT dining experience.  My girlfriend and I decided on a whim to give it a shot (after making the obligatory puns and double entendres on the name). After staring at the menu for two minutes, trying desperately to decipher what we were to have, we gave up and asked the guy behind the counters advice. His name was Chris and he was extremely helpful. He sold us with free samples, rather than descriptions of the plate.  I ordered the gravlax; my girlfriend ordered the laxpudding. We entrusted the quality of our meal to the word of Chris and the small sample we tasted, because, in my mind, the ingredients had no business being together in one dish. Both dishes were based on lox, aka smoked salmon.  We were both pleasantly surprised at the dish that greeted each of us a few minutes later. The food was EXCELLENT! And while not the cheapest dinner in the world, you get an enormous bang for your buck. Your plate is literally stacked with food. Kudos if you finish it all.  Bottomline: Beaver Choice has a weird-ass name, but it serves some of the best food in Tempe. We will be back for sure, and I encourage each of you to give it a shot. I guarantee you wont come away disappointed!"
4,"Very clean and well thought out floor plans, nice to have a friendly staff with smiling faces. Best Target I have been to in a while."
3,I was here for a business dinner recently and loved their new hummus plate.  They put grilled zucchini on it and had some fresh jicama which was awesome.  I wasnt in the mood for BBQ at the time but so I ordered a turkey burger which came on a whole wheat bun and some steamed broccoli.  I love the healthy options.  Thanks to Red Robin for helping to fight the battle of the bulge.  Just make sure you bring lots of will power when come here because its easy to blow it...especially with the desert menu!!
4,"This was a nice casino experience.  It wasnt as loud as Las Vegas.  The food was really greasy and made me a bit sick.  Admittedly, I chose to eat at the fast food place inside the casino, but ah well.  I still had a great time.  I dont really gamble, so I only came out $10 ahead, but it was still fun."
5,"Wait, were in Arizona? "" No seriously, this is Arizona?"" I had to keep blinking cause I couldve sworn we were still in the East Bay last Friday night as we waited for our faux meat meals to arrive at our table.  My hubster and I were visiting his mom for the first time since she had moved to Phoenix and admittedly, neither of us were too stoked on the visit. We totally wanted to see her but as for Phoenix?? Anyways... she knew what she was doing by taking us straight from the airport to Green.  I LOVED EVERYTHING. From our appetizers (hummus + fries) to my entree- I had the chicken curry noodle bowl, to my beverage- a suicide mixture of their house green tea and house limeade (YUM) to my soy ice cream treat (I had the mint with paul newman oreos!) which I scarfed down after being totally stuffed. This place is ridiculously good. And reasonably priced. And fresh. And not stuffy or pretentious in anyway. Basically, this would be our new steady if we lived anywhere near... Tempe. Which fortunately we do not, but I have to say, you Arizonians sure are stoked to have a place like Green. And now we have a reason to look forward to returning to AZ!! :D"
3,"I didnt go back again.  The haircut turned out to be worse than I thought, being quite unmanageable.  I ended up going back to the local Mexican barber, who charged 12 bucks for a pretty decent haircut. I think they gave better massages than they did haircuts.  Still, it wasnt a bad place, and one could do worse."
5,"Came here with a bunch of the crew from work during lunch, and wow! This hidden gem on the corner of Indian School & 48th Street is a must visit if youre in the Arcadia area. The food here is amazing, and theres such a wide variety including delicious tater tots (even sweet potato tater tots) and the mouth watering reuben that I had chosen. You get a good sized portion as well. Thank goodness for take-home boxes!  The restaurant is very spacious, and the staff is really friendly & laid back but get you seated and eating your food in no time. It gets better; the price of the food is VERY reasonable, in fact, Im kind of shocked how inexpensive they are. A well deserved five stars!"
4,"Angel Sweet Gelato is a welcome treat on a hot day. It sits in a small strip in the middle of Mesa Riverview, but if you can find it (west of Logans), its worth a stop. The selection of flavors is large, including a dozen dairy-free fruit flavors that arent quite as decadent as the dairy gelatos in the left-hand case. Ive tried the lemon and all the berry flavors, and havent found anything that wasnt delicious. The prices are reasonable, and you can order sizes from one small scoop to a big box (all unfortunately served in styrofoam). There isnt a lot of seating in Angel Sweet, but Ive never seen it full. Get a punch card if you live in the area. If you like firemen, this would be a good place to see them hanging out.  =)"
3,Patio seating is lovely!
5,"Best donuts in the valley. I like a variety of donuts (my favorites, though are raised sugar and raised glaze), and all the donuts here are great.  Never too heavy, always tasting fresh."
4,"If I had a higher salary, I would shop here. I love this store, however the only reason I come here is if I am looking for something you cant get at a large grocery chain like a Frys Marketplace. They have a great wine selection, fine imported cheeses and the pastry counter makes your mouth water. When they are having a sale on steak I always buy it here."
5,"I love Jimmy Johns.  It is WAY better than Subway.  The bread is what makes it.  They bake their own bread right in the store and then right before they make your sandwich, they pluck out the middle of the bread to fill your sandwich with goodness.   You choose your sandwiches by number, but you can customize any sandwich.  I usually get the #4 which is a Tom Turkey.  It has turkey, lettuce, tomato, lettuce and sprouts on it.  I like their chips too.  They call them Jimmy Chips.  They are the kettle cooked type.  I personally do not think this is your ordinary sandwich.  The combination of bread and ingredients makes it a great sandwich and they are fast to prepare."
4,"What a cool space!  We needed nourishment on St Pats, as the corn beef and cabbage they were serving at the Irish pub didnt exactly float our boats. We found ourself at Hannys and had a great experience. Their pizzas are light and tasty.  They looked like too much when they arrived, but they turned out to be the just the base we needed to get through a heavy night of drinking. The reclining booths took a second to get used to, but they just added to the laid back atmosphere once we mastered them. OK, two friends go the tiniest tinis that didnt seem like much of a value, so its probably not the place for hard core drinking (I know, but these are the things I look for)  But for a relaxing cool place to start your evening off, I can still give it the thumbs up."
3,"Ive been to F&H on numerous occasions. The night usually goes a little like this..   I walk up to the entrance, I see people smoking outside in a small fence area. I look over and see these groups are starring at me like i just blatantly readjusted myself in public.  I give them one more glance and realize in two hours we all will all be best friends exchanging pointless stories about our days when in reality I couldnt give a flying f*[% about their new kitten they adopted and named Bunbun. But in 2 hours I will thrive and cherish each of their stories and be amazed I never found such intellectual people sooner.  Before I get to the door I feel eyes spying on me. I look up to find  one of 17 hostesses peering through the window ready to yank the door open a mere second before I reach for it. (you cant beat them to this..  Ive tried several times, they are good at what they do. Just prepare for this and accept it.)  as I step inside my eyes automatically affix to the bar top. I scan up and down the row of seats. As Im scanning down I see two empty seats. Im not sure if guy code applies to bar seats like the bathroom urinals (guys.. You know what Im talking about)..  But I usually just start the night off not giving a...  Because I already aknowledge the fact things are only going to degrade from here anyways.  I start with a tall miller light and look up at the game playing on the TVs. I continue my beer almost empty then order some beer battered buffalo chicken tenders with extra ranch. I look into the reflection of my phone to make sure my face isnt suddenly disfigured because she looks at me as if I just asked for an order of wine and chive biscottes.  I explain that I am looking to get the beer battered buffalo wings then she calls for backup like Im speaking a foreign language.  ""Hey Lacey! This guy wants beer battered buffalo chicken wings"" they say some things, fumble a bit then come back with..  So you want ""chicken tenders and ranch?"".  I explain again to the both of them. They both tilt their heads to the side. Either this one beer slammed me, and Im speaking nonsense at this point, or they just dont understand what buffalo wings are.   ""so..you want a cheeseburger and a side of buffalo sauce sir?"". They do a little further team planning and come up with a solution and I end up with beer battered chicken tenders dry as a bone with no sauce and a side of buffalo sauce. My friend getting the opposite  when we both ordered the same thing except he gets no buffalo sauce and a side of ranch.. I find it to bother me less and less each time because I expect it now.   Their food really is good, and their service is...Did i mention that their food is really good?  I look back up at the TV acting real smooth and care free only to realize ive been watching female tennis on the television next to me for the past 30 minutes while everyone eIse is attentively watching the football game. Im not ashamed to admit that I continued watching it. I think it was the loud grunts that kept my attention. I finish eating, grab another beer and me and the friend approach the ping pong table.  You need to go to the hosts stand to get the equipment. Its free. Wait no its not..  Its a dollar. Nope that was last month. Now its 9 bucks an hour. Better empty those pockets. Just remember every hour you waste playing you could have fed 27 starving ethiopians for  a month. But in your drunken stooper you chose to dish out the $9 like myself and play pool or ping pong. Shame on you. PS.., beware of the twins...  I thought I was loosing my mind after a few beers seeing one girl cover the whole restaurant in a matter of mere seconds. If you ask  your server for something and she looks at you funny...  its either because you asked her twin, or you asked for buffalo chicken tenders. Also... if you stay late enough the cops hide and wait for you to leave the parking lot as soon as you turn out. But of course you have a designated driver... right? Overall, the food I have ordered was great. The service was... the food was really good."
4,"This is not very far from my home, but for some strange reason, I have never visited there.  Maybe because we dont have New York Delis in Spokane, and Im not familiar with the idea. The other day, I agreed to meet my son and little granddaughter there for coffee and a bagel, and found that it is much more than just a bagel stop.  They actually have a restaurant with quite an extensive menu.  I had breakfast - the choices were very diverse - including skillets, various pancakes, bagels (of course), french toast, omelets, and a number of other items.  The servings were large, and the service very prompt and friendly.  Most importantly, the prices were more than reasonable. The only thing that I disliked, was that they did not have hash browns.  They do have potatoes as an option with the meals, but you cannot actually classify them as hash browns.  They are good - but not quite a replacement for hash browns and gravy. I actually like it so much, that I stopped and had breakfast two days later on the way to the golf course.  Again, great breakfast at very reasonable prices.  Although I usually dont eat lunch, I am going to have to make an effort to stop in and try their lunch menu. And their deli counter, and all the different varieties of bagels."
5,"Ever since I was diagnosed with a Gluten intolerance, Chipotles yummy burrito bowl has been my constant companion. The barbacoa is seasoned well and works even better with a kick of the Chipote Tabassco sauce!"
4,"I love Los Favoritos!  Mi favorito is the chorizo breakfast burrito (most popular item there?).  Interestingly enough, I think its bigger if you order it for dinner than for breakfast, but for either its plenty big!  Muy rico with salsa verde.  Im embarrassed to say that Ive only had a few of other things on the menu (quesadilla and other burritos), but theyve all been delish!  For some reason, though, I just get my mouth set on chorizo burrito.  Its seductive. The folks there are very nice and sincere, and they know English well enough, although I think some are working on it.   Tip:  You can order ahead!  Especially helpful if youre going during the lunch rush, when it seems like every kid from Seton H.S. is there.  its pretty nice to breeze in and pay and grab your stuff when theres a gaggle of folks still waiting for their order to be called.     Tip 2:  If you dont order ahead, you can place your order there and then go across the courtyard to Starbucks to grab a coffee (that probably costs more than what you got at Los Favs) while you wait for your food, if youre so inclined.  This is a bad habit you might not want to get into.  Believe me!"
1,"Man oh man... I cant decide whether I want to review this place or not under the auspices of ""if you dont have anything nice to say..."" All I have to say is this:  We ordered food. It came totally wrong. I asked for a vegan salad, not specifically, but thats how I ordered it, and it came with chicken and cheese. This just shows a complete inability to read the order. People make adjustments all the time. I have worked at a restaurant. I have fucked up. I should have been lashed 40 times! Read what people order!  So when I got the wrong salad and saw what an unbelievable disappointment it was going to be, I ordered a veggie sandwich instead, which, to their credit, they delivered and took off the bill.  The best customer service in the world could not overcome this sandwich. It was a monumental fucking embarrassment. I cannot believe they let that thing out the door. I ate it because I was starving but I would have liked to have driven it back there and go through it, ingredient by ingredient, with the preparer... Explain to me how this is appealing to the eyes, mouth, stomach, etc. I just hated it. A lot.  Sorry, Im sure youre nice people with good intentions."
3,"Like anyone else with good taste, I think this place was better when it was called ""The Library"". IDK when their specials are, but the first jager bomb was $2 on a Tuesday night, and Ill love them forever just on that alone. Theres plenty of space to sit throughout the bar, a restroom attendant, and usually a DJ. It reminds me of sports bars you find everywhere in Glendale, just with a younger crowd."
1,The Duce is a disaster.  As an Arizona native and a downtown local I root for cool interesting places downtown. I wanted to love this place. The 1st time we tried the Duce I was extremely let down by the customer service. The parking is atrocious. Its as if you are inconveniencing the staff by asking where you order food. They were out of just about everything we wanted to order. So disappointing.  However I decided to give them a second shot. Everyone has a rough night. We went to an event there last night the entertainment by Scandalesque was AMAZING... same TERRIBLE customer service from the staff at the Duce. Management needs to wake up. Great concept. Horrific customer service and staff.
5,"Costco Travel - My husband and I recently returned from a trip to the Big Island, HI that we arranged throught Costco Travel. After shopping around I found that their prices were the best and after one phone call I was able to make all arrangements for airfair, condo and car. They didnt have arrangements with any B&Bs on Hilo but were able to adjust our travel dates. Everything went according to plan with all arrangements being accurate. Condo was outstanding and a great value. We got gas and did some souvenier shopping at the Costco in Kona and again saved $$.   Ive shopped at Costco for years - now becoming a groupie!"
4,"Thai food is one of my favorite types of cuisines. I have been going to Thai Rama for over 5 years now, and they are always consistent! this place is a little, hole in the wall type. (those are usually the best) Whenever I am having a thai fix I usually order the same items. Sometimes different... But not always.  OK.. 1. Thai tea... the best in the valley!  2. Pad thai with chicken... level 5 - 5 is usually med spice but to some ppl its very spicy... you can always lower the number to a 1 or 2 and itll still be just as good. 3. Yellow pork or chicken coconut curry with potatoes, onions, carrots, & pineapple.... level 5 again.... my fave 4. Theres one more beef dish that is absolutely delish! But, I forgot the name. Basically all it is, is thick rice noodles and thinly sliced beef stir fried.. Kind of like a chow fun but better! Oh and I would also like to add that they have a very friendly waitstaff and pretty good service. If you like Thai, check this place out!!!"
5,"They have the BEST Pad Thai!  Ive had many other dishes of theirs which are all delicious, but that Pad Thai haunts my dreams at night. (In a good way)  Ive recently had Touch of Thai which is a highly rated Thai Food restaurant.  Of course, I had to try their pad thai.  Honestly, It was just as good, but they used the thin, stringy noodles and Dara uses the wide, flat noodles.  You wouldnt think that would make much of a difference, but thats what makes me drive 20 miles more to go to Dara Thai to get their Pad Thai than driving 5 miles to go to Touch of Thai.  If your not watching your calorie intake I highly suggest getting the cream cheese wontons and Thai Tea with your Pad Thai!  Now thats what I call delicious!"
1,"I really wish I had a dagger to stab myself in the face for trying to eating here. Absolutely the WORST PLACE in the entire valley. I would turn around and go ask for my money back but I am to embarrassed to even be seen in the drive through again.  Was on my way home, thought I would give it a shot. I ordered random items; chicken taco and onion rings. The taco was like eating out of a horse trough.. It fell apart immediately and I found myself trying to shovel it into my mouth. After about two bites I realized the meat was questionably chicken. The onion rings were so blah I didnt even touch them.  Please do your self a favor.. Dig in the nearest dumpster for lunch, then go home and pound a bottle of vegetable oil. It sure beats the hell out of this joint. No joke."
5,"Okay, so I admit it. Sometimes I get a stubborn idea about not wanting to go to a specific establishment due to a fierce loyalty to one of its competitors. It took me a while to cave on this one. Too long in fact. Everyone loves Lux and as it happens, they have good reason to! My latte was supremely delicious. The environment is great albeit slightly confusing as far as the flow of service.  I absolutely love the patio area. This place definitely has a Pacific Northwest vibe that immediately resonates with me. The service was really laid back, yet authentically friendly. I was far too busy enthusiastically catching up with a dear friend to take in all that Lux has to offer. Theres room in my heart for Lux after all so I shall return. My primary concerns going in were the coffee, service and atmosphere. A+ for all in my humble estimation.  I was a little late to the party, but I had a blast anyway."
3,"This place was highly recommended by various websites, so I gave it a shot when I was in Scottsdale. The service was great and the food was good.  We sat in the bar area which was lively. It feels like a neighborhood hangout, so everyone looked like they were friends and having a good time."
3,"Wow, what a busy place. We came here while visiting Scottsdale. We are always up for a good breakfast and it seemed that this was the appropriate restaurant to try.  This place reminded us a bit of a great small pancake house in Anaheim, CA called the Original Pancake House. It is much bigger and modern, so it lacks charm, but the food is better than standard faire. With that said, the creativity is good in their menu selection, but poorly executed. I had the banana french toast and was a bit disappointed. The banana bread used was fine, but too dense for french toast. It hardly had any egg coating to truly classify it as french toast.  They serve huge slices of raisin toast, but bigger is not necessarily better. Very dry and not flavorful.  Eggs were fine, and the service was good. I would come here before going to IHOP, but I would seek a different small hole in the wall breakfast joint before rushing back here. Avoid the Sunday brunch hour patrons, unless youre prepared to wait an hour or so. Enjoy."
1,"Hipster,Trendy ????-I think NOT !!!! Very disappointing......weird crowd ( older men on the prowl? ) , and unfriendly bartenders w/ lots of attitude. Ive given this a few tries thinking I just hit it on a bad night , but wont be going back. So many other great places in Scottsdale to visit !"
1,"I got on the internet and looked at the menu and called in the order. I informed Brothers that I had a $3 coupon also and would pick up the perpperoni pizza and sampler and they said it would be 20 minutes.  At the register I was charged $12.95 for the $8.95 sampler.  I told the cashier that the internet menu had it listed for $8.95.  She just smiled and said ""Oh, we get that a lot but we dont have a menu.""  I said, ""but its on the internet with your address/web page""  and she said, ""yeh, I know we get that a lot but heres our menu""  and she handed me their copy-machine menu which did not even have the sampler listed.  I politely told her that they should take the menu off the internet if its not right.  The sampler was 4 pieces each of wings, mushrooms, cheese sticks, zuchinni.  The sampler was just like frozen generic small pieces ""out-of-the-freezer-bag"" deep fried.     I live near and our family had hoped to make this our weekly outing for pizza; however, Ill go elsewhere for better food and prices.  I also dont like false advertising.   A customers frustration should be a business owners learning opportunity to make their business better.  They can learn a lot from their customers."
4,Great egg drop soup.  Kung pao chicken - meh.  Beef broccoli - yum.
2,"I dont know why i have been here more than once, but the parking is horrible, and the food is only so-so.  lots of color and flare but not much going for it.  the baja sauce is great but i seem to get sick later that evening when i eat it.  i need to learn from experience"
4,"I must say that this place was nothing like I expected when I read that we finally had an authentic Parisian patisserie in the Valley, owned by two REAL PARISIANS!  I envisioned a warm, casual shop with fresh croissants, danishes, cakes, etc. like the places I experienced in Paris.  Needless to say my expectations were way off - I should have been thinking less mom-and-pop Paris bake-shop and more Payard Patisserie, with delicate pastry works of art in a stark, hip space.  We shared two desserts, a blueberry something-or-other and a lemon tart, and both were fantastic!  So while its a little more upscale 8th Arrondissement than casual 5th, its still authentic Paris in Scottsdale, and who doesnt love that?!"
3,"The Orange is a popular, well-reputed joint in my neighborhood. The Pizzaria is connected to a small bakery and deli. IMO, its overpriced and over-rated. The parking is usually impossible and often dangerously full of gargantuan SUVs and expensive sports cars.  There is valet parking available at times that is also overpriced, pretentious, and unnecessary. The parking lot is tiny and I need a valet to park my car? What a racket. Overflow parking is available on street in the bicycle lane (thanks a lot folks!) I used to have coffee here in the mornings week-ends in the outdoor cafe, but the place has become a neighborhood nusiance. The orange caters to a clientele that largely appears to regard itself as quite UMC. Probably they should be located in Paradise Valley instead of eastern Phoenix. I give it three stars because the food is good. That cant be disputed. The facilities and the company leave much to be desired though. If your idea of an enjoyable experience includes good food surrounded by SUV-driving soccer moms with ears adhered to cell phones, this place might just be for you."
4,"I think this is the best frozen yogurt Ive ever had. Even better than Golden Spoon, which is saying a lot cuz I love that place. I tried the peanut butter, triple chocolate (not my personal fav but my coworker loved it), cake batter (to die for), strawberry (tastes like a strawberry malt), snickerdoodle, and prailine. They have the best toppings of any yogurt shops Ive visited. Favorites include choc chip cookie dough, mini gummi bears, mochi, yogurt chips, cheesecake, and boba... not to overlook the fresh fruit...."
4,"We went early, so we didnt have any of the seating issues others have mentioned.  The decor and set-up was neat, and the bartender was friendly and attentive.  I agree that the drinks are pretty expensive -- but the White Rabbit was amazing.  Im not  a big fan of mixed drinks generally, but horchata and white chocolate liqueur?  Awesome!  Ill definitely be back.  Great place!"
1,"Having a miserable experience flying from Boston to Reno. My connection was in Phoenix, and the flight from Boston was running a bit late. I asked both of the flight attendants if it would be possible to deplane before the other passengers as I had a very tight connection to make. One actually laughed at me and told me I would be fine. 12 hours, a horrible nights sleep (as they did not offer me hotel accommodations) and two delicious airport meals later I am sitting in the terminal waiting for my flight from Phoenix to Reno to board. Sorry buddy, not really fine. I missed my flight by 5 minutes. I would have been fine if US Airways offered their customers with tight connections the opportunity to deplane first, as every other airline I have flown on does. Will avoid them at ALL costs!"
4,"Lacking a clean or acceptable Chinese restaurant in Casa Grande, I discovered this jewel while showing homes in Anthem. Menu has many choices and restaurant is clean with attractive decor. The dishes I have chosen so far have been excellent with nice portions. Service is friendly and efficient. Well worth the drive from anywhere in Pinal County!!!"
5,"Ive passed by prestige nails in walmart 100s of times but never really thought of having a pedicure there (even though they are always busy!) As I stared at my feet, long overdue for a pedicure, I thought it was about time to try them...since walmart rarely lets me down why should the nail salon inside? To my surprise I got a wonderful pedicure or $23 not too bad this day in age...my to mention it was just as good as going to the more upscale salon just across the street!  Im glad to be the first to review them they deserve it! Now if only they did facials at walmart and hair Id be set!"
3,"I have either an extreme LOVE or DISLIKE for this place. More love, though.  Things I love:  Great wine, with all different price points, which is nice. Cool, speakeasy atmosphere. Great bands and entertainment. Great cheese platter and flat breads. Good prices.  Things I do not love:  Service. Are you a bouncer? A bartender? Are you leading me to a seat? can you get me a seat? Its confusing. The staff is not clearly defined (not only do they not wear uniforms, or name tags, but they are scarce and hard to find)  The mix. It is kind of a random mix. I guess that can be a good thing, but I was there once and it was like Spring Break in Cabo, and then the other time, it was like 50+ snow birds day. Either one is fine, it is just hard to gage when to go and who to bring, like, my mom, or my pals.  They serve dessert, but no coffee. That, to me, is just strange. Buy a coffee maker. Sheesh. They have this amazing fondue that would be great with some baileys and coffee, and alas, no coffee. Strange. I know, ""wine bar"", but if you serve dessert, coffee should go hand in hand.  In the end, the place is cool and they have some of the best entertainment there. they ambiance is nice. Go early for a seat, they are hard to come by. Beware of paying $ at the door for an entertainment fee, but it is well worth it."
5,"hamburgessa heaven.  Guac and bacon on a burger is ingenious.  I do wish they had some curly fries or something but the burgers cant be beat.  Also, the condiment BAR is brilliant"
5,"Killer sandwiches and dill potato salad that set my world on end. I wish I had known of Berthas while I was in town for a long period of time because I would have eaten here everyday.   I went for the blue cheese roast beef sandwich which was a magical meal.  Lightly toasted bread, slightly sweet mustard mayo, fresh veggies and the most beautiful sliced roast beef I have seen in a long time, this sandwich was nothing short of awesome, damn it was good.   As a side I got the dill potato salad, this stuff is NOT your grandmothers potato salad, this is what your grandmother should have been giving you.  Holy wow, creamy dill potato greatness.  I am going to have to figure out how to get this out to me in LA. The deserts looked great and the little chocolate brownie cookie gave me an idea of how good the other offerings most likely are. Berthas is awesome, fresh sandos, salads, wraps and potato salad that will redefine the potato.  Berthas please open a location in LA, I will keep you afloat!"
4,"I just went here for lunch and mmm, mmm, mmm, this place is sooooo good!  I had the shrimp and veggie pho and the broth was VERY well-seasoned and so delicious going down my tummy!  We also had the shrimp spring rolls, which were also delicious and very refreshing.   My only complaint, and the reason I couldnt give 5 stars, is that only 1 out of 3 air conditioners was working in the restaurant.  And on a day in Phoenix when its109 degrees outside, plus the heat from the pho, we were burning up in there!  We had to go get some froyo afterwards just to bring our body temps back down to a normal level!  I look forward to going back when the temps cool down."
2,"We had a mixed experience at Happy Hour (HH) and dinner.  Quick summary follows.   Hits: + Food was tasty. + Ambiance was nice. Misses: - Waitress was never able to bring the ""last call"" round of HH she offered.  No explanation or apology.   - Asked if I ""minded"" anchovies on my salad.  I said ""no,"" but didnt realize there would be an upcharge until the final bill came. - While in the bathroom, observed one of the staff go straight from the stall (not the urinal) to the Kitchen.  No hand-washing, not even a pause by the sink.   ¡Buen apetito!"
5,"Wow!  This place completely rocks!  Very professional, courteous, and very good at what they do - make cars clean again.  The price was very reasonable and I will be back again many times over!  Thank you, Stewart Detailing!  Job well done."
3,"Oh Porter, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways...  I had a, ah, as in just one, porter and was feelin fine. And I was extremely glad to have the sweet potato fries instead of the regular ones with my sammie. Our waitress was pleasant, prompt and next time Im going to ask to be seated outside or at a high top table. Our booth was great for chatting with my friend, but I like a little people watching at the pub! Now, if you are avoiding SunUp because you remember that there used to be something called  the Sonora Brewhouse in that same space.... Youre in luck!! The brewmaster, Uva, is still there, still brewing his witches draught. But now, you wont get them confused with the Sonoran Brewing Co. in north Scottsdale. Hooray!"
4,Great service got there when they opened and hardly anyone was there. Our server mike was really nice. Tried the margarita chicken and  I loved it. Tequila lime sauce was to die for. And the quesadillia was huuuuuge! Its a little pricey but hello your in scottsdale!
5,"The staff is friendly and knowledgable and the sales on stationary are always welcome.  Lots of specialty papers to purchase by the sheet or in packs of 25 or 50, with matching envelopes.  Oh so easy to give just the right touch to my correspondance. Even when they are swamped with business the staff is always ready to lend a hand or help with a jammed machine. When my puter is down I rent one of theirs for just $10 and hour with printing priveleges."
3,"I agree with Rachel C. & Luciana L. on the parking situation and the logistics of the whole place.  Although I will probably go again because my kids do enjoy it and I was able to get the last paid parking spot (at 11am).  I have been to this event and others in downtown Glendale and they cant handle the volume of people that go to these things.  Downtown Glendale is similar to downtown Scottsdale but 1/10th the size and capacity.  There are tons of little shops in a historic district with ONE parking garage and whats worse is you will pass many empty lots that they pay cops to stand around just to make sure you dont park there.  I finally ask a police officer where CAN we actually park.  Anyway, the event was cool with lots for the kids, it is a farmers market that sells food you would find at the fair thrown in with some chocolate vendors, jumpers and carnival type rides for the kids in separate areas that require separate tickets for each area (this was way annoying too).  Glendale could do better by putting up directories everywhere for people to know where they are, where bathrooms are, and they could spread things out and offer more space per human being (I am sure this place is stupid in the evening).  Plus they need to do something about parking, even if they build a HUGE garage and charge $20 a car at least there would be options for people who dont want to walk a mile before they walk around for miles.... All that said, we will probably go next year because we still do not know the definition of insanity."
4,"This is my second time in Chandler for work, and Ive been here about four times.  Ive basically come here every day during my visits.  Its a great place to have a casual meal and get some more work done.  I like the food and the friendly service, and also refuse to pay for the wireless in my hotel room (even though my employer would reimburse me for it).  Plus, I like the relaxed, community-esque feel of this place. As for the food, Id recommend the Tuscan Chicken sandwich - the Ciabatta bread it comes on is really quite delicious, but make sure its fresh.  salads are simple, but pretty good, and everything tastes fresh.  The chocolate chip cookies are to-die-for.   The people who work here are very friendly.  One guy was particularly helpful and helped me as I contemplated for about five minutes what I should get.  He then came to check how my food was, even though this is a self-service type of place.   I would not recommend the half-sandwich half-salad combo if youre really hungry.  Somehow a whole sandwich seemed more filling to me. Even though I avoid chain restaurants, I really like this one!  Maybe its because we dont have one in Northern California, so it still makes me feel like this is ""something different""."
5,"Nadya is one of the nicest people you will ever meet.  Part of her personality is what kept me coming back. Recently she altered a bridesmaids dress for my girlfriend and did a terrific job.  Flawless.  In years past, she has altered all of my ""work attire.""  I have since moved, but whenever I return home, if I ever need any work done I will bring it with. Nadya, you are a wonderful person, and any recommendation I can send your way I will!"
4,yumtastic!! just dont forget your safety whistle and pepper spray! ....even during the day....
4,Awesome burger and fries.
5,"The slices of pizza are cheap, huge, and very very good.  I really dont have to say anymore."
1,"I wrote a less than stellar review about this place some time ago and decided that my prior awful experience might have been a fluke and as I love great BBQ, decided to give them another go .....  I was right the first time! As before, the food was ho-hum at best, the prices too high vs the product quality but the death blow to me was once again, their customer service or shall I say lack of customer service? We had to ask the bartender if we could get a drink (Thats odd) and all the wait staff acted like they were doing us a favor by waiting on us. To top it all off, they had little to no air conditioning so it was brutal to sit through a combination of bad food, crummy service and high heat!!! For me, this place is officially off the books and we sure wont be back. Lesson # 1: ""Your in the service industry, try and acy like it"" As a BBQ fan, Ill try elsewhere ..............."
5,"Deceptively fantastic. Like Lady Gaga. Pizza A Metro is the Lady Gaga of mid-range Italian restaurants. Its so unassuming from the outside that I was pumped when pulling up. Oh, man, Ben, we could get in a knife fight at a location like this! Sweeet! Its not that bad. But the food is righteous. The pre-meal bread with the tomato + balsamic + red onion deliciousness was such a great alternative to the typical bread and oil. We split the antipasti (yes, the portions are comically large... we maybe cleared a layer (a delicious, delicious layer) of very fresh, yummy artichoke hearts, prosciutto wrapped canteloupe, and a smattering of other favorites. We then had the pizza with sausage and broccoli. Perfect cheese, perfect crust, yum sausage, perfectly crunchy fresh broccoli. Its clean and warm on the inside. Try it. You like it. And tell no one that I mentioned liking Lady Gaga."
4,"ive lived in the downtown area for like 85% of my life and have only ventured into the heritage square area a few times for Heritage Squarish events...usually its a walk thru to the Arizona Science Center or to a parking lot. but i was here two weekends back to back for the NBA All-Star game tip off party and the Matsuri Festival a week later..and wow. this place can have some awesome things happening. the tip off party...75-80 bucks for a ticket..and full range to entertainment lots of food and drinks to sample...free of course. plus the museum and science center were open. live DJ music and access to Pizzeria Bianco and Rose and Crown. totally made my night. the Matsuri Festival was alot of fun, saw Jack play the drums, saw some kids dressed up as anime and manga characters. no free drinks that day. but still was alot of fun. Heritage Square gets my 4 stars for being a cool place to have things to do. plus the old houses and stuff rock."
5,"OK, Where do I start? This place is AMAZING! I love the food here, especially the fact that you can eat and watch a movie at the same time! Forget about the movie theater popcorn, you can get a rack of ribs here while enjoying your movie! Before the movie starts, a waiter walks around with an iPod touch taking your order, usually during the previews. During the movie, you can press the Service Light to add more things to your order. About nearing the end of the movie, you will get your check, so make sure that if you want more food, get your orders in before the movie is over. Pricing is good, it costs about the same as  a dinner and a movie separately, why NOT kill two birds with one stone and get it all at once? The seats are REAL COMFORTABLE, as long as you get the love seat, or leather seats, just dont get the ""office chair"" seats, as those are like....sitting in an office chair for 3 hours watching a movie ;)."
5,"Yogurtland as I say it with a high-pitched tone in the end.. This is my ultimate favorite dessert!! I would give 10 stars if Yelp allows it! All my friends know that I am attached to this place! We started this craziness together with my better half when we tried it a few years back after a basketball game...and all I said after first walking in was, ""This is fun!!"" and we got hooked eversince!! That I collect their spoons, only used by me and the hubbie, and I now have 5 YGL  cups full of spoons!! I am the ultimate Yogurtland addict!! heehee We go as often as 5 times a week that we already know the staff in this location. And we go that often that we even tried to abstain from it for Lent just to see if we can resist it!! haha Most of our friends also keep on asking to try other fro yo places to see if something will beat my YGL addiction..and so far nothing has won over it yet..=D So, my favorite flavors are Taro, Pistachio and Toasted Coconut and the of course the seasonal flavors, Pumpkin Pie, Gingerbread..Oh I wanna go now just thinking about it! My favorite toppings are the yogurt chips, sugar cone, sunflower seeds, shredded coconut and graham!!  =) Perfect blend of flavors!  So if you havent tried it yet, grab your favorite partner and enjoy some ""Yogurtland""...=)"
2,"Stayed for a few days. Was not impressed. I prefer Marriott, but was not available. The room was clean and check in was good. The pool and fitness center sucked. I had dinner in the restaurant, a hamburger. It was good. Over all downtown Phoenix sucks, nothing to do after 6PM."
5,Friendly staff and great Americanos!
3,This is my favorite Pei Wei. It is always clean and never too crowded. They also have a fantastic covered patio. I like the Mongolian beef or chicken and the Dan Dan noodles and my husband likes pretty much everything he tries here. They used to have a beef ramen bowl that was to die for but I guess it was only offered for a limited time. The food can be salty at times but I always enjoy it.
4,"I love Lux. The new venue is great because there is a lot more room. The only problem is that its still not enough. This place used to be a great place to just hang and spend the morning on a weekend or weekday. Now its over crowded and doesnt have that neighborhood feel anymore. Some of the staff is super friendly while others have attitudes.  The coffee is impeccable and the food is delicious. That first sip of my soy hazelnut latte is always the most delicious and compares to no other coffee. This is what keeps me coming back.  If you want to sit for a while, make sure you arrive at the right time. And keep in mind the right time is never the same time. You pretty much have to get lucky to find a good spot. Ive started getting my coffee to go. Also, they dont open until 7AM. This is when my shift starts, so I can no longer go before work. A great remedy for this was to buy Lux beans and to brew my coffee in a French press each morning. Im definitely not complaining about the quality. Its still delicious.  I try to make a visit to Lux at least once a week and will continue to do so...."
1,"I hate to give this place 1 star but my recent experiences were horrible. I use to dine at this restaurant often with my family. The more we go, service decreased. Our water cups never get filled. The very last time I was there, I found a gnat in my pho. Although I have eaten about 50% of the medicore pho, they asked if I wanted another bowl. I said no; I was there on my lunch break. No time to wait for another bowl. I got up to pay for my bill and to my surprise, there was no discount or any sort of accommodation.  I am disappointed with them and will not be back."
4,"Okay so the only reason Im giving Rigobertos 4 out of 5 stars is because Im currently on a diet and its not diet friendly. So Ill write the rest of the review based on my pre-diet dining.  This place is some serious mexican food. Not the fancy stuff, the good, mexican-at-home style. Its good at 6am, lunch, dinner, midnight, and even the 2am drunk-Im-hungry meal. I have three favorites here. 1. Bean and cheese burrito w/sour cream - the beans are refried with good ol grease. Its delicious and the cheese is legit cheddar. 2. Super Nachos - I dont understand how you can not finish this one. They give you a ridiculous amount of chips with a mexican buffet on top, but once you get the hot sauce on it, you cant stop. 3. Carne Asada burrito, no pico, with sour cream and Guacamole - Cooked fresh on the grill and wrapped in the biggest tastiest flour tortilla. They even will sell you the tortillas by themselves if you ask.  Enjoy!"
5,Hate long lines at the DMV?  Hate dealing with the DMV for any reason? Then you should check out Desert Title Service.  I had a complicated Title transfer and was dreading spending 4 hours at the DMV office the last day of the month but I knew I had to do it.  So today my daughter and I went over to DMV and waited an hour before deciding to call Desert Title Service.  Had I known I could go in to a place with no lines get a title release and a title transfer I would have checked them out sooner.  I called their office while sitting in the DMV and drove over.  In less then 15 minutes I had the title released and the title transferred.  Daughter had new plates and her title in less then 5.  If you need anything to do with your car I urge you to call them and/or visit their office.  You will be surprised at how fast and efficient their office is.  I will never visit the DMV unless I have to.
5,"I was hoping to be the first to review Grayhawk Family Chiropractic, but Im glad to see Heather feels the same way I do about them. Dr. Frank Sorrentino is a true professional. Ive suffered from low back issues for years and Dr. Frank always knows how to treat the problem. Between regular visits and the website they set you up with to demonstrate stretches tailored to your condition Im glad to report Ive been in good shape for a while. Whether you have an ongoing issue or have just injured yourself Grayhawk Family Chiropractic is the place to go."
5,"Hole-in-the-Rock is a cave-like natural rock formation sculpted into the top of a sandstone butte in Phoenixs beautiful Papago Park. Its one of the most powerful scenic views in our city, and is the perfect place to showcase its exquisite landscape. Just a short hike up the butte and youll find yourself in the amazing chamber sculpted over millions of years of wind and water erosion.  At sunset there are few locations that can rival its awesomeness. The hole faces south, giving a wonderful view over south Phoenix all the way to South Mountain.   Hole-in-the-Rock is truly one of the greatest attractions in our city and everyone would be blessed to experience it at least once.  No fee to enter. Bring a camera!"
4,"$4.00 for a lunch special in Tempe is pretty good, if you ask me.  If youre eating two slices of pepperoni pizza for lunch, I dont think you can complain that your pizza is ""greasy.""  (Thats what they invented napkins and dabbing for.  Actually, napkins were probably invented for wiping your face, but they can be used for soaking up grease from pizza too.)   I dont know that Ill go out of my way for this one, but I wont complain about it either.  If I could give 3 and a half stars I would, so Ill be generous and round up (Barros, if youre reading this and see my generosity, feel free to return in kind with free lunches for life.  I think thats a fair trade.)"
4,"Great Thanksgiving meal. I had a similar meal at Busters on the Lake for cheaper last year but that doesnt take away from the good spinach and sweet potatoes. Good service, good bread, good view..."
1,"I was really excited about this event, maybe my expectations were too high, because I was really underwhelmed.  Very little shade, ran out of water, by the time I got there at 1pm (other obligations) 20% of the vendors were out of food, and by the time I ate my way through some, everyone else was already out.   60 bucks for that?  I dont think so.   And when I mentioned it to ""the person in charge"", he was patronizing, invalidating and kept telling me how happy the chefs were.  Well, Im your consumer, big guy.   Sorry, Devoured, wish it could have been better.  What food I did try, was pretty good."
3,"They have high definition pictures of their menu items proudly displayed on the walls, and I like that. Regarding the Chicken Pad Thai. The chicken and tofu were cooked perfectly, but the noodles were a bit chewy. Spring rolls were great. The pic on the menu shows them served in halves, but they arrived at our table whole. My date had their Thai noodle bowl, and Id suggest skipping on the beef balls.  Also, its very bland if you order with no spice. The owner recommended that we vacation in Thailand.  He also offered to install new granite flooring in out home.  Travel agent, mason, restaurateur.  He does it all."
4,"Im not a big drinker, but this place is pretty sweet if you are. Huge selection at excellent prices."
3,"Descent food, of course its not autentico. Free chips, salsa, & wifi though."
5,"Mylissa has given my daughter and me the *best* cuts! If you can, see her. She will take great care of you!"
2,"Are there food that is NOT-true ? OK... I got it, food has to be true to the original taste ... which mean it doesnt always taste good, I supposed ....  Had the Shrimp spring rolls .... Turkey Bolognese ... could be true to the ingredient but not true to the dish of how it should taste....  Fit very much in the north scottsdale vibe .... look at me, I only eat healthy, organic, true and whole food ...  which actually could be a good thing ;)"
3,"Agree with most posters about the setup - left much to be desired. I was smart and arrived BEFORE 4:00 P.M. so I could jump in early for some short and FAST lines.  My 15-yr-old son was with me, and hes a fairly picky eater, which was one reason I brought him - so he could see that there are other foods he might like if he TRIED them. I got a lot of food between 4:00 and 4:30, when the lines were short.  I probably got to try 10 trucks before we left at 5:07.  We went back to some trucks more than twice or three times when we found something we liked. My advice for future events: 1.  Help the trucks deliver the samples FASTER.  Not sure how - maybe get them an extra staff member?  But the samples on some trucks were coming SLOWLY, so that needs to improve. 2.  Better location, maybe not on dirt, and maybe a little larger.  Once the lines got up to 20-30 people, the going was CRAMPED and it was taking a long time to get your samples. 3.  Maybe a lower price for tickets?  Seemed kinda steep for the amount of food each person received. All in all, I enjoyed the FOOD, but the rest of the logistics, not so much."
4,"Pretty good food.  Place is funky, werent many people in there for a Saturday lunch (especially considering the proximity to ASU) but the service was decent and the food was good.  Very inexpensive, 2 lunches and drinks for $15.  Ill stop by again when Im out that way."
5,"I just wanted to add that in addition to party and catering equipment, they also rent heaps of tools and equipment. Think hedge trimmers, lawn aerators, cement mixers - stuff you might need for a once a year or special project, and so, dont want to invest in the equipment. In our case, we needed a chainsaw to take down some dead stuff from last winters freeze, an unwelcome sapling, a dead tree, branches encroaching the roof, and to tame some monstrous oleanders. I was just about to head to the tool rental department at that big box home improvement store, when a friend mentioned A to Z. I gave them a call, and their prices were competitive. Plus it had that feel good factor of being a local biz. The process was pretty easy. We got a thorough tutorial on chainsaw operation and safety, and were on our way to some serious arboreal carnage. Pro tip: rent on Friday after 4pm. You can return it Monday morning, and only be charged for one day (Saturday), since they are closed on Sunday."
4,"there is one problem with bagel nosh: its not close enough to tempe! went there on a sunday a little before closing-the bagel selection was sparse but they offered to get us any kind of bagel we wanted. the garlic,feta, and dill cream cheese was amazing and the breakfast sandwich looked hella yummy! went to get a refill on our way out and the owner offered a free large glass of iced tea since they were about to close. the service was great andi might have to make the trip out there very soon!"
3,Very small selection. I am used to seeing a larger inventory of fine dresses and only found one that was nice! I also felt like I was maneuvering through an obstacle course with all the people in there and the poor arrangement; this is a messy and busy store.
3,"Perfect for a nightcap. Dim, moody lighting and totally intimate. Drinks are pretty pricy and didnt eat any food, but the service was great! I loved the feel of the place so much Id go back sometime."
2,"I want to give the Cornish Pasty Company another star, but I cant quite do it... The pasties I order are REALLY good... They have a fine beer selection (including Mickeys Big-Mouths) and a few cocktail options... Most of the sides and desserts are pretty solid. I tend to stick with and very much enjoy the more traditional pasties like The Oggie, and the Cottage Pie (OK, OK... I love the Royale with Cheese, too). However, some of the ""premium"" pasties like the Pesto Chicken and the Salmon pasty are a bit funky to me.  Even that, I can write off to personal preference. What really keeps the CPC from getting another star or two is the restaurant itself.  Its a long, narrow space, 75% of which is divided by a bar. Seating is along the wall or at the bar, with a few larger tables in the back.  On the other side of the bar from the customers is where ALL of the restaurant operations take place; cooking, cleaning, prep, and bar. If one is sitting at the bar, this intersection of consumption with infrastructure is often a bit too much like watching sausage being made.  I dont really expect a fine dining experience at a place like the Cornish Pasty, but I really dont need to hear the dishes crashing into the sink and i dont need to see all the potential for cross-contamination (food preparation right next to the dirty dishes and raw meat right next to the beer glasses).  My worst experience was arriving late and sitting at the bar while they were cleaning the ""kitchen"" area and still serving food. It was really noisy, the refrigerator light kept blinding me, and the smell of cleaning chemicals was so strong that it made it impossible for me to even think about enjoying the pasty. I walked out after about 4 bites... Ive wanted to go back several times, because I do enjoy the food and beer options, and finally went back last Friday. The food was as good as its ever been but the environment will still make me think 2 or 3 times before heading back. Maybe Ill just have to take advantage of their take-out and stop at Tops liquor on my way home for the Hoegaarden..."
3,"We went to dinner there on a Sunday and we were the only ones in there for most of our dinner. Downtown Phoenix can be somewhat quiet on the weekends, so this was no surprise. The service was great as was the food. I had a pizza and if you like thin, crispy crust you will enjoy the pizza as well. The music was a little loud for a Sunday dinner, especially since we were pretty much the only ones in the restaurant. I will go again, probably during the week so I can get a taste of what it is like when it is busy!! Overall...decent meal!"
5,"Tasty fair trade organic coffee and breakfast and lunch. Even have almond milk!  Excellent choices. Super nice people. Comfortable space. Lets help support these independent shops who exude caring, quality and individuality to thrive in our community!"
1,"Can I tell you how much I despised Fate with all its pretentious, snooty bullshit? I should have known the second I realized that Bliss/reBar was in the same building that it was probably tainted from all the leftover evil. And so it is. We showed up and the restaurant was practically empty. There is no hostess or even a hint of one. We stood there for many minutes on end before even being acknowledged by one of the many servers who were rushing around (perhaps serving to invisible people? The place was dead.). We were told there was a 15 minute wait, or we could eat on the patio. Um, its 40 degrees...  AND THE PLACE WAS DEAD. I guess well wait. We go back outside because there is zero point zero extra room to stand. The server comes back out and says they have two large parties coming in an hour, but we can sit inside now if we can be done in 45 minutes. Thats sure inviting, isnt it. So we hustle on inside and make some hasty selections. $9 faux comfort food shit like gourmet mac and cheese just offends me, so I go with the veggie sandwich. That sounds innocuous enough, right? The food came out straightaway - too fast for a burger to be cooked medium well, like my companion ordered. Sure as shit, she cut into it, and it was bleeding and mooing all over the place. My ""veggie"" sandwich arrives and it looks like a Filet-o-Fish from hell, some huge block of something unidentifiable due to extreme deep-frying. I couldnt help it - I asked the server what the hell it was.  Eggplant. Ohhhhkay then.  It was like trying to eat a deep fried brick between two pillows. Impossible. The pretzel bread, while yummy, is totally unyielding. Only Jenna Jameson can fit that thing into her mouth. My companion was suffering a similar fate with her bleeding burger. There was mayonnaise and shredded cabbage and boiling hot eggplant juice going everywhere and it was goddamn ridiculous. Neither of us got through even a half of our sandwiches. I wolfed down the side salad just to get something remotely healthy in there after the onslaught of grease, although I almost choked on the buckets of sugar syrup they call salad dressing. So, while we are attempting to recover from this mess, the server goes MIA. Youd think if they were trying to hustle us out of there, wed get a damn check. Nope. No. Nada. Had to chase someone down and ask for it. When it finally came, there wasnt even an itemized receipt, so even though the total seemed a little low I couldnt check it out. I was so over the whole experience at the point I didnt even care. I left a shitty tip and we escaped to the bar next door, where the cute bartenders gave us some free drinks and we sucked down innumerable $3 vodka specials for the next four hours.  Just UGH in every way."
5,"The consummate beer bar.  Great selection, knowledgeable bartenders and eclectic patrons.  What more can you want from a drinking establishment?  The food is good too."
4,"One of my lunchtime favorites -- a great bar menu under $10 (steak, shrimp, Italian sausage, etc) with good quality food and prompt service.  Fun place to have drinks at happy hour. Plus, they have a nice traditional dining room for dinner.  The bar area is always DARK (how it should be)."
4,"This is the best venue in the valley for what is intended to be; a midsize venue that attracts national touring acts, with a standing room only intimacy that you wont get at a place bigger or smaller. I saw Clutch here recently, and it rocked my balls off. I didnt drink at the place (took care of that before and after) so I cant comment on drink prices. Parking did suck, but there was a structure across the street for five bucks. One downside, going to the website to check out upcoming shows is tedious. The calendar is soooo hard to sort through, I would only go there to get more info on opening bands not listed on ticketmaster.com"
4,"This place is not pocket book friendly. It would have cost us $12 just to park if the center didnt validate and knock off $11.00 of those bucks. For 2 adults and 2 children it cost us $50.00 to enter the door. (This is just to enter the center, does not include the Planetarium or the IMAX Theater) My kids and husband found it to be a neat little place, I enjoyed just watching them have fun. Would be good to go with a group of people and watch how everyone interacts with everything. There were a lot of useful and strange facts to learn about several different things.  I rated it a 4 star because my kids enjoyed this so much. I would suggest trying to find coupons, going on special days because spending $50 to just enter the center and it took us 2 hours to see everything and that was even with them trying all the experiments.  Worth it to attend at least once though.  My children are girls and they are 10 & 6."
4,"delicious! def got the sandwich Adam on Man vs Food got! i think its called Del Reys! it was sooooooooo good and the sandwich was huge, the price was great! however, there was a long wait, so Id say be patient for their services!!"
1,"You want good food? Youd be better off smuggling goat cheese in your boot and risking an anal cavity search for doing so than eating at this airport. You want scenery? Try desert. You want a comfortable seat to wait for your delayed flight?  Well you are in the desert so youd probably better off finding a cactus and straddling it face first. You want a relatively close connection for your flight? Well tough shit.  Oh yeah, theyve got people movers but somehow they have this magical ability to disengage peoples legs.  Yeah I know it sounds crazy but as soon as people step on to these things their legs stop moving and they plant their fat ass right in the middle of the walk way.  Whats wrong with your legs you mammoth!?"
5,Harvest hash is incredible - ask for their house made BBQ sauce on the side.  Vegan raspberry banana bread French toast!!!  Sooooo good! Its a busy place on a Saturday morning but they work fast and everything runs smoothly. A gem!!!
5,"Very very good lunch spot!  Was a little disappointed when I found out they didnt have pizza on their lunch menu. But when I tasted the prosciutto ""sandwich"", I didnt mind anymore. It was a great meal with a relaxing & great ambiance!"
3,"I had the Soppressata with Aged Provolone & Roasted Peppers.  It was a solid sandwich overall.  The quality of ingredients was pretty good, but the only part that gets me is the price. $8 + tax?  Wow all that ""supply and demand"" stuff I learned in Econ class wasnt a joke.  Worth trying once, but I dont think this is a place Ill be grabbing lunch at on a regular basis."
3,"Westgate has a few more restaurants now but stil need more shops for shopping to come along.  It is starting to build up but slowly.  It was nice to walk around from dinner, but the amount of teenage kids there were a little annoying.  Guess I am not the mommy type!"
1,"I had such high expectaions after reading reviews but I was so disappointed.  The food was not good, the service was awful.  They got all of our orders mixed upo. Will never go back and cannot recommend this place.  PS  one dish was good and some enjoyed the soup.  There are 100 places I will visit before returning to this place."
5,"This is the only Ben and Jerrys that has successfully withheld the recession in AZ.  This means that this is the only one left as well.  Its located in a beautiful plaza called El Pedregal.  They have live music on Sundays.  I found out this information from the friendly owner who told about the history of the store since I asked him if their location was really the only one open in all of AZ. The location is very North Scottsdale.  I am not sure how it does for business, it is far from commercial areas.  On my drove over, I mostly noticed many well built homes.   This is the only Ben and Jerrys left, and I strongly encourage those who enjoy this ice cream to go out and support their business."
4,If you like a juicy sub and you dont mind onions... Ask for your sub to be made Mikes way! Its excellent.
5,"I just ordered the hamburger then added my favorite toppings. Another excellent burger, I have to say! Plenty of meat, freshly made - and hot off the grill! Top notch fries as well, overflowing from the cup they put it in.  It takes about 5 - 10 minutes to get a great, fresh burger like this - but is very much worth the wait!"
4,"Okay, you know whats cute? A group of wholesome-looking teens dressed in soda counter garb and serving all-American treats to overheated tourists and locals alike.....thats cute! This place has a bit of that ""throw-back"" feel with the soda fountain options that you just dont see very much anymore. I had the Gold Rush, which consisted of orange sherbet, vanilla ice cream, and Sprite all blended into a 50/50 bar-esque sippable yumminess. My son really enjoyed his chocolate shake but wished there was 3 times more of it (teens...cant live with em, cant ever fill em up!) The establishment was clean and quirky and, frankly, over-staffed for that time of day...but, hey! better than the alternative, which happens all too often in this tourist town!  If youre so inclined, the PHX Big Entertainment Book has a BOGO coupon for any menu item at the Sugar Bowl :)"
4,"Ive been to this theatre a fair share, but this time I went for the UFC 111 Georges St. Pierre vs. Dan Hardy.  Who knew one could watch UFC at the friggin movie theatre?!?!  They also show boxing fights. At first, I was SO hesitant, I even walked back from DSW to ask if I could get my money back if I decided against going.  Yes, as long as its before the fight.  It was $20, yeah kind of steep, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and I will go back when its a big anticipated fight with a fighter I like. But, come on, Georges fighting on a large screen!?!?!"
4,"My friend refers to this place as ""Hitlers Bunker"" but I choose to see the romantic side of Kazimierz.  I love the dark, cool interior with the large comfy sofas and chairs.   It can be daunting to find a bottle of wine since the list is incredibly vast.  I usually settle for a wine flight like the French Kiss or I open up the book to a random page and swirl my finger around until I land on a bottle in my price range.  The flat bread pizzas and fruit and cheese trays have been nothing but impressive.  Some of the waitstaff can be a bit surly but most of the interactions have been quite positive. All in all I think this is a superb place to take a date after a nice dinner so you can unwind."
5,"After the Padres Spring Training game, we had reservations at Don & Charlies in Scottsdale .  None of us had been here before and it came highly recommended by my dad.  As soon as you walk into Don and Charlies your eyes start feasting on all the signed baseballs down the left wall.  Now everywhere you look from floor to ceiling and even the ceiling itself is covered in memorabilia and autographed items from athletes of all sports and other celebrities.   Besides the amazing assortment of sports artifacts, I especially like the Cactus League Beer List which pairs a beer with each city that has a team in the Cactus League.  Colorado = Coors Light , Texas =Shiner Bock, Chicago =Old Style, and San Diego =Stone IPA, etc.  Also worth mentioning is the complimentary chopped liver platter with rye bread and bagel chips they bring as soon as you are seated.  I had the ribs with coconut shrimp combo which was great. I wasnt thrilled with the side dish: potatos au gratin which is a $2.50 upcharge.  They also bring a huge bowl of cole slaw with each entrée or you can choose soup which comes in a smaller bowl than the cole slaw!  We were too full for dessert and as we walked out, this place was packed!  I found myself trying to take in as much memorabilia as possible and then on one side of the crowded lobby there sat Willie Mays himself.  He was signing his book (or a baseball) for a $200 charitable donation to his foundation. Needless to say, I m not bringing home any memorabilia myself!"
3,"Approaching the front of the building, I was instantly impressed with the theatrical lighting on the outside of the building, the foyer is large, ruby red and created a grand mood when I walked in. They even had large crystal chandeliers.   The theater itself is a nice size, not large, but sits on the medium scale. My seat for the Christmas production of the Nutcracker was on the third row, center and the view was nice. There didnt seem to be any room for live band or orchestra, but the sound system was full."
5,"Great food and service. It will only be for special occasion for us because its pricey, but it is worth it. They made us feel special."
4,"Its a Wal-Mart, with a subway inside."
4,"Stopped in for lunch with an old friend.  We had lots to catch up on, so got a booth inside where it was quieter.  The decor is true to Toms heritage at this location, modernized with lots of historical pics on the wall.  The Governors Room has an attractive gleaming golden state seal over the doorway.   Service was excellent.  Food was OK.  Great bar with Toms specialties, where I dont water, so no info on that.  I should have had the 1929 chili, or a burger to really try the food.  I had a Cuban sandwich with house salad instead.  The salad greens were fresh, the tiny Tom atoes sweet and crunchy.  The sandwich was a Phoenix Arizona Cuban sandwich from Toms Tavern, not like a Cuban sandwich made by somebodys Cuban mother or Abuelo using all the right Cuban ingredients.  Kind of like Mexican food in Yellowknife, Yukon Territory.  Good test. Next time Im having the burger.  There will be a next time. Ambiance 1 Service 1 Cleanliness 1 Cuban Sandwich 1"
2,"I feel sad to write this...but Vincent needs to improve things or his place will be only a past memory.  Im ok with that based on the dinner I had there recently. The restaurant was packed...but with people who had Groupons...I only wish I had because my dinner would not have been 177.00.  Too much for a weak and sad plate of out of date food. We had the Foi Gras, small portion and so/so:(...Duck chimichangas they were decent. The wild boar was a tiny serving...we were fine with that because it was tough and difficult to chew.  It was accompanied with a hospital style vegetable medly of green beans with carrot shreds and minute white rice.  We also had trout..it was covered in a heavy white sauce (French) and had the same veg medly and white rice...seriously like the hospital food...or a big banquet service.  It was edible...but not great...We each had a glass of wine.  No dessert for us...it was hot in there and the arches and decor reminded me of a taco bell.  I wouldnt even go back if it was a free meal:("
5,"I should have done this so long ago, but we forget our Doctors need reviews too! Ive sent my boyfriend, my family and my friends to her. You should know about her too! Ive been going to Dr. Bradley for 10 years! She is my all time favorite doctor because she is always bright, smiling, genuine and just overall warm! You want to thank her and hug her at the same time. Her staff is professional and friendly. Mandy at the front desk is wonderful at her job. Ive followed Dr. Bradley to 2 locations and would never think of going anywhere else. Shes helped me with everything from migraines to pnuemonia to well woman check ups to getting my gall bladder removed! What a versatile and knowledgeable woman she is! I take my son to her now and he isnt afraid to go in. Peace of mind knowing we will be treated well, and taken care of is all I could really ask for in a general doctor!"
2,"I wasnt feeling RnR at all!  We dont usually venture into Scottsdale for many reasons, but the siren song of a non-pretentious late night eatery was just calling to us.  Unfortunately, non-pretentious doesnt apply to the prices.  We came shortly after opening day, so I completely forgive the awful service, the place was packed.  I was irritated though when we were told they were only going to be serving sandwiches and burgers, nothing else, even though we were specifically told that this place would have breakfast all day.  Breakfast is what I wanted.  Oh well.   We ordered the burger and got some mini corn dogs as an appetizer.  The mini corn dogs left a lot to be desired.  They were served with plain ol ketchup and plain ol yellow mustard.  Yuck.  The corn dogs were only okay.  The breading around them was way too bread like and it was just lacking in flavor.  The burger was enormous.  Unfortunately, what it lacked any flavor.  I guess what it lacked in flavor it was clearly making up for in size.  The bacon that came on it was equally huge, roughly 2 inches wide and at least 8 inches long... (thats what she said! Ohhhh!)  Anyway, I was obviously not impressed.  We might come back sometime, because their breakfast really does sound wonderful, but hopefully theyve figured out how to efficiently serve a busy restaurant by then."
4,"Im a fan of J.T.s.  Reasonable drinks and REALLY good wings.  Its small, so it can get pretty crowded, but the people are friendly, service is good, too.  J.T. s is a great neighborhood bar, nearly free of any douchebaggery."
4,This is a very interesting place.  Dont go here thinking it will be classy.
4,"We arrived into Sky Harbor and decided to go into Tempe and Mill Ave....a tradition that we do each time we go to Phoenix.   New from my last visit,  on Mill Avenue, Canteen Modern Tequila Bar and we decided to give it a try..   It had a nice open bar area onto the road and the atmosphere was lively and fun.   Happy hour was in progress and the selection of items were great.   The house Margarita hit the spot coming in at $4  on happy hour and yummy.    The happy hour appetizers were also great.    Nice selection, worth a stop with a group of friends.   Wait staff was fantastic and we had great service."
5,Love Bakers. I live in Glendale an it is worth the drive to go see them. They know their stuff and am always pleased with my purchases.
4,"Ok, so this business is currently run from a mobile kitchen.  Now I do mean that it is a kitchen.  The crepes are made to order, the ingredients are absolutely fresh and delicious.  They are currently going to various farmers markets, Old Town Scottsdale and Awatuke,  and going to private parties when they are asked.   So when you have the chance to find where they are and try them.  You wont be disappointed at all.  They are great.   Also check then out on twitter."
2,"I have been here a couple of times as it is about a block from where I live. It is your typical neighborhood bar. That is, not a lot of people, average prices, okay happy hour. Their menu is bar food. Burgers, Wings, Fries, and so on. The have the standard domestics on tap (Bud, Coors, Miller etc). A lot of times they have live music at 9 or 10. If this is for you then you have the chance to see an exclusive performance since not a lot of patrons are there. However, it gets pretty loud. So if this does not sound like your thing, be aware what time it is.  Service is pretty bad if you are in the ""restaurant"" part. The only time I have eaten at a table the bartender was also our server. Needless to say slow is an understatement.  The only reason I go here is so I dont have to drive anywhere. 2 stars because I have experienced better, much better. My experiences tells e that the Waterfront is just a corner bar. Nothing Special."
5,"Im not a big ""organic"" kind of guy.  I could care less about hormone free this and BPA free that.  For me it all about flavor and service - it has to be better than I can make it myself and you have to take better care of us than I can. Having said that, Im HEAD OVER HEELS in love with the food at Tryst!  Service is family oriented too.  They treat you like a regular on your first trip in the door and burgers are to die for. As a die-hard burger man, this is my default stop.  It is close to the house, in a pleasant shopping center, and has the best burger Ive ever eaten in Phoenix.  Id give it an extra half star if Yelp would let me.  This place is that good!"
4,"I met up with a girlfriend at borders. This Borders is across from the Scottsdale fashion square. The store is inviting, clean, bright, and new. They have a variety of books, and good sales. Upstairs is the Seattles best coffee cafe. I had a coupon for a free medium drink when you buy a bag of coffee beans. I was surprised how good my cafe mocha was, better than Starbucks. note: If you have little kids, they do have story time on Mondays at 10:00 AM. Every Friday is Bean Friday in Seattles Best Coffee cafe. Buy a bag of beans and receive a FREE medium beverage."
2,Order was supposed to be ready 20 min ago...yet here I am still waiting...not even busy!
1,"My love affair with Pita Jungle is a long one.....perhaps longer than any other restaurant, certainly longer than I can remember, and at least for the adult portion of my life, which is why it pains me to write this review.  For the last 6 months, I have ordered takeout one day a week from this location, typically on a Friday or Saturday. The ridiculousness that has become my adult life has necessitated a heavy reliance on takeout for my main source of nourishment. Although the food is always spot on at Pita, my takeout experience has been anything but.  The prior 3 out of 4 times I went to pick up my food, I ended up waiting past the promised time. Now Im not unreasonable, waiting 5 or 10 minutes is not a big deal, but each time has been a wait of 25 to 30+ minutes past the pick up time, with no apologies or explanations. I was beginning to wonder if they had ever started cooking my food before I got there. The last time I mustve looked really irritated, because I was offered an obligatory baklava for my wait.  Used to the wait, I started showing up 5 to 10 minutes past the promised time, just as preventative maintenance. Imagine my surprise when my order was ready as promised thie time. I left with my bag of food and a smile on my face. I get back to my friends house, open the bag, and begin to realize just how badly the order has been screwed up. We ordered 4 items, 3 of which were wrong. I load one item up and head back to Pita. Making me wait a ridiculous amount of time for my food is one thing, but blatantly screwing up my order is too much. As I explain my situation to the takeout girl, she goes to get the Manager who proceeds to inform me that I ordered it wrong. As I struggle to keep my cool, I inform them that they must be mistaken. One item was ordered with chicken, my item was turkey, and the other two were salads. Everything came with chicken. The salads were for my vegetarian friends, and Im allergic to chicken. Theres no way youre going to convince me I ordered chicken for myself and two vegetarians. Sorry, try again. Without too much ado, the correct dishes were provided, and yet another obligatory baklava was offered. I declined. There is only so much wrong that baklava can right. Dont get me wrong, their baklava is amazing, but its not going to make up for them screwing up my order, then trying to blame it on me. Oh, and did I mention that they gave me a coupon for a free appetizer? Too bad the coupon expires in a few days.  Im afraid I will be taking my weekly Friday takeout business elsewhere, until enough time has passed that maybe, just maybe, I can find it in my heart to forgive Pita Jungle. In the meantime, I suggest you try to get it together down there. In case you missed the count, thats 4 out of the last 5 takeouts you missed the mark on, including 1 you tried to blame on me. Thats shameful."
4,"Was not satisfied first trip, service was awful and place was deafening.  But we thought food was worth trying again.  So, now that the place has been open and matured it is much better.  Our sever was good, the place was about 1/2 empty which made the noise level much more bearable. Food, very good.  Not chicago family run good, but for the valley very good. I asked for my shrimp to be spicy and it was.  Hsb cant handle so hot and his curried duck was mild as requested.  The mustard wraps, unusual and tasty.  Hsb loved the peanut sauce.  Chicken and lemongrass salad, good flavors.  We will be back."
5,Ice Ice Baby... Ice Ice Baby... All right stop collaborate and listen; Ice Now is here and its got my attention  Make some drinks - not warm but frosty; And believe me when I say they are not costly Will it ever melt? yo I dont know. Give them a call and theyll show To the extreme I yelp like a sandal; Ice your drinks and get lit like a candle ... Ice ice baby PS - not sure where the sandal line came in but writing a review in lyric form is a challenge!  This is the best I can do for now... Need ice for an event?  Call Ice Now! They offer free delivery and their pricing is surprisingly cheap. And good luck getting the Ice Ice Baby lyrics out of your head... (sorry)!
4,"Went here for the first time for xmas dinner.  Atmosphere was very chill.  Almost felt mafiosa style at times. It is a mellow setting and very relaxing with unique music.  They also have TONS of sports related everything to keep youre eyes busy while youre enjoying your meal.   Our server was awesome, we got our food very fast and everything was excellent.  I recommend getting the 12oz filet.  It was right up there with other top shelf steak houses in the area and reasonably priced. We will definitely be going back to Don and Charlies."
4,"Went in to pick up lunch. I ordered the bean & cheese burrito (per Yelpers recommendation). It took a LONG time for my order to be ready, next time I will definitely call ahead. The price was awesome and the food was really good.  I anxious to try more items on the menu!"
2,This is my first time back in years. It will be my last. I was in the bar area for lunch it was almost 1hour 25 min before I could get out. Ten min before my drink order and almost as long before food order. A secound drink forget it. Guy next to me walked out.
4,"I love this place, that is, the selection and randomness of the food. However, the prices Im not so keen on. My sugar snap peas were the same as Safeway and were fresh, so Im sold on that. Its also the only place I can find my Kettle brand chips in the flavor I crave, so Im sold on that too. Now if only the prices could reach my income level, thatd be stellar."
5,"They really do a great job, and you will really pay for it. I dont have incredibly pricey clothing, so getting my $50 blouses dry cleaned here just doesnt make sense- but I would absolutely trust them with very important articles (nice sport coats, lined trousers, wedding gowns, blood soaked mattresses... haha, kidding)."
4,"This may be fiction.  I dont know for sure.  Heres what I pretty much think happened. The other night I was at a bar.  two days later I heard that it was Turf.  So Im gonna go with it.  In body I was there, however my mind was suffering under an oppressive weight called alcohol that blurred pretty much every little thing that happened. For example: did I really find myself screaming piano man at the top of my lungs, to rapturous applause from the rest of the bar?  every time I tried to stop, I was goaded forth into the next verse?  (did the piano indeed sound like a carnival?) Was I really and truly told assuredly that I was gay?  Did I really have an argument for what felt like hours with a fair-eyed girl who has severe trust issues and one fucked up gaydar?  despite the wedding ring and total pudgy married-guy look did I still come across as gay?  (my wife tells me that it can only be the broadway rendition of a billy joel song.  I begrudgingly concede) Did I really hear someone who claimed to be a teacher misrepresent the very definition of a parallelogram?  Did she really say that a parallelogram could not have right angles?  Did I really scoff right at her and throw down the argument-crushing example of the square (QED biatch!)?  Evidently I did, because I do remember her backing me into a corner and beating my ass with a relentless barrage of haymakers, both rights and lefts, that left me bruised like a second-rate (albeit mathematically-savvy) prizefighter the next day.  Her-110 lbs at the very most, me twice that and then some on the most gravitationally-forgiving day, and I had no response but to cower in my own fucked-up rendition of the rope-a-dope. Her: ""flex your stomach so I can hit you."" Me: ""Are you joking?  thats me, flexing.""  (#fat) so I can tell you little to nothing about turf--I genuinely cant say for sure if that was the place we were at.  But since I asked right when I got there if I was allowed to yell, and the bartender said yes, yell to your hearts delight! I have to say four stars.  I would have said 5 but that looks really out of line with the rest of these reviews..."
1,"Absolutely disgusting.  I had enchiladas and a taco, just to give them a chance.  This was the worst mexican food Ive ever had.  Waaaaaay too much government tasting cheese on the food, and hardly any meat.  I do have really high standards because I grew up on Tex-Mex but this was just pathetic......"
2,"Ive been here a few times with my mom because she really likes it, but overall I wasnt impressed.  The food was tasty, but the service was atrocious. It was busy the last time we went, but we stood around inside the door for probably 10 minutes before an employee even noticed us.  There were other parties waiting, too.  You just had to stand around and wait for someone to bother seating you in one of the open booths. Everyone was satisfied with their meal.  Ive had the spinach tacos, which were very tasty, and I appreciate having a veggie option that wasnt a run-of-the-mill bean and cheese or chile relleno.  (Ive had their chile relleno and wasnt impressed by it.)  But no one refilled our drinks the whole time or checked on us.  Not even once.  Maybe this is better when you go at a less busy time, but the food isnt mindblowing enough to make it worth the lousy service on a Friday night."
5,"Duane is amazing!  Reliable, Responsive, Reasonably Priced, i simply cant reccomend him enough!  Ive used him four separate times now and have been more than happy with each visit.  I wont call anyone else!"
5,I love Jimmy Johns!
5,"My trip was inspired by Adam Richmonds visit and while I couldnt do the 12 slider challenge, I knocked out 5 and was close to taking on a 6th. The GM stopped by to check on us and the waitress was great! Be sure to grab some fresh baked deli treats before heading out."
5,"If I were ever to be executed, Id want a Meat & Cheese pasty for my last meal. With two red wine gravy. Its *that* good."
3,"Dammit - I have been here a dozen times and its been so ""mixed""... The best of times, and the worst of times... though the last two times (for late night drinking with friends) have been pretty fun... Drinks are cheap and the crowd is ""lively"". So, for now, I will suggest Dos Gringos to the college drunkard and/or professional drinker after 9pm. Bring some friends!"
4,"I have been to the particular location many times.  Except for the wait, we have always had a good experience. I just love that deep dish pizza. I am sure it is on slice away from stopping my heart, but not here for the health food."
4,"Thank you sir, may I have another.   Although I didnt have to revert to Oliver Twist-like methods to punish myself gastricly with this greasy, plentiful, delicious food, and it was quite easy on the wallet, I feel like I shouldnt have come here. This is a guilty pleasure whenever I travel to sections of the country that have them. Nice big portions piled on plates that Im pretty sure were clean, the staff hollering out orders to the assembly line that never seemed to cease. Awake and alert, this place is good. Hungover or Drunk, this place is Frickin Candyland. Bottomless coffee, Waffles as big as your head, overworked waitresses franticly running from table to table.. ahhh the American dream."
2,"Eh- it was just ok. I was told about the must-have Cajun fries, and they were just ok. Not spicy at all and appeared to be just like Cajun season salt sprinkled on regular fries. The fries were Kinda soggy and very greasy. Burger was ok. Tasted fresh, but I didnt know a ""regular"" burger was 2 patties. Yuck.  Sadly- my favorite thing about this place was the fact they had Mello Yello. Sweet.  Its good enough to eat- but its no where near the quality of Chuckbox which is right up the street. Shoot- fatburger a stones throw away is better.  Its good enough to eat again if your friends wanna go, but its not a place that ill be craving or want to search for parking to eat at. Oh well."
4,"Imagine this, a swanky new Scottsdale restaurant that has down to earth prices, fantastic food and attentive top-notch service? Sometimes its hard to believe that this kind of place even exists, but its no mirage, the Spotted Donkey Cantina is everything that I had hoped and more.  Starting with the service, there are details that just go to show how the owners and management are in tune with training of the staff. Everyone we encountered was pleasant, seemingly happy and genuine.  I have to tell you though, when it comes to eating at SDC, youll be in good hands, Chef Patrick Bolls hands to be exact. His background includes years working with local chef-lebrity Robert McGrath, which has paid off in chiles. The southwestern influenced menu is well balanced with just a little bit of something for everyone. I mean who doesnt love the addictive crunch of La Canasta Corn Chips ($6)? Along side are 3 different salsas including a smoky charred tomato, a deeply flavored red chile orange and finally a tomatillo green chile salsa. All were surprisingly mild though these seemed more about flavor rather than scorching your face, thatll come later. The ""Shooters"" ($8) seemed harmless enough. A chubby jalapeno pepper stuffed with cheddar cheese and bacon then encrusted with a coating of tortillas and deep fried. At fist bite your mouth is filled with a creamy spurt of hot cheese followed by the pork-tastic flavor of bacon. Then it hits you, the burn from the jalapeno is scorching but a quick dip into cilantro buttermilk sauce helped cool the flame.  If youre still trying to cool the flavor induced fire one of SDC many salad choices will do the trick. The Spotted Donkey ""Chop"" Salad ($12) is prepared table side with you controlling the amounts of roasted corn, cucumber, queso fresco, cilantro, warm smoked bacon, and avocado. Then tossed in a luscious jalapeno buttermilk dressing and served with crispy flour tortilla chips on the side, it cools and satisfies. Composed into tidy rows of tortilla crusted chicken breast, avocado, bacon, chopped egg and manchego cheese and dressed in chipotle vinaigrette, the dinner sized Southwest Chicken Cobb Salad ($12.50) was almost big enough to share.  The center of my universe, at least for a minute, was the char grilled Big Ol Jack Ass Angus Burger ($11.50). This is a seriously tasty burger, topped with cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, avocado, jalapenos and horseradish mustard, fries on the side. Continuing with the meat parade, a sizzling iron skillet filled with Fajitas ($16) was placed in front of me. While you have your choice of chicken or shrimp, the idea of beef tenderloin mixed with sausage, sweet onions and tomatoes seemed like the hearty choice. Along side are the usual accompaniments like guacamole, salsa, crema and warm flour tortillas, what was unusual were how quickly I scarfed these down, delicious.  While the space feels decidedly modern and upscale there wasnt one moment where I felt uncomfortable or out of place, even with burger juices running down my face."
3,"The banana pecan french toast was great - order a 1/2 order and split it with someone else for ""breakfast desert""! Rest of the food was definitely better than ok, but dropped my review to 3 stars because restrooms werent clean and had no hand soap -- where are employees washing their hands???"
4,"Good clean Chilis. Friendly staff, although that can be a bad thing... since I have to tip them extra because they refill my cup every 5 minutes. I have been going a little bit more than usual because of the ""2 for $20"" deal. Never had a bad experience here, just wish there was more on the 2-20 deal."
4,"You Say Potato, I Say Chicago By The Rue Old Chicago is where I ate, I would probably by lying, If I said it was great. Lunch special calzone for $7.99, By the time I left there, My big hairy belly was doing fine. Youre probably thinking ""eww thats nasty"", Like Magnum P.I. it rules, The waitress wasnt sweet or sassy.  Inside that finely browned bread pouch, I had it stuffed with pineapple and jalapeno, Unfortunately my mouth didnt say ""ouch"".  If youre reading this and rolling your eyes, Its okay, Im not here to entertain you, Im just here to eat pies.  End"
4,"one of the best chinese food here in phoenix. you have to tell them to use less salt. because often times, the food just a bit too salty. other than that. it has great selection for Szechwan style food."
3,"3/5 the sandwiches are huge. im not to bent on the whole freedom fries this and such on the menu, but it is AZ so i guess that is how it runs."
1,"UNBELIEVABLE!!  so enraged and appalled!!  i took my 91 yr old mom in to the salon for a mani-pedi.  after the pedicure she had the manicure and she asked for french tips.  the GIRL claims she asked mom if she wanted gel nails -- shes 91, did not understand the gals ""english"" and cant hear, so i presume she nodded.  after mom paid the charge of $60 and i picked her up (i had another appt.)  she told me about the charge and said she had never paid that much for a mani-pedi.  i called and was told the normal charge is $30 w/$5 added for french and HE said to come back cause it was mistake.  we did and the whole group of technicians said it was moms fault for saying ""yes"" and would not concede AT ALL -- not in the slightest.  i found that to be awful and mom felt very taken advantage of.  i will NEVER return there and i caution any hearing-impaired customers to not use this business.  TO ME and of course to mom, it was such a slam on the elderly. mom is a visitor from the east coast and at her age does not need to be treated that way.  VERY BAD BUSINESS!!!"
3,"This is more of a pizza joint for people who have young kids. They have kid games and it gets pretty noisy in here. The pizza is not too bad . If I was craving pizza, this place would not be high on my list but, it was an interesting experience nonetheless. I suppose If I had kids or I was a kid I would probably enjoy coming here."
4,"Good Whole Foods location overall... The workers are very nice and attentive, and the food selection is good! Not the biggest Whole Foods Ive ever been to, though."
4,"I went to this place with a family member upon their recommendation.   The salad was amazing!  I forget exactly what it is called (cowboy chopped salad I think?) .  Firstly its gorgeous (comes in rows of the ingredients which are beautiful colors; arugula, tomatoes, pepitas, dried currents, chicken, asiago cheese, and dried corn for some crunch)  Then when it gets to your table they pour on the dress (a creamy dressing with a slight basil taste to it), and it all gets mixed together.   I believe it usually comes with salmon instead of chicken but we ordered ours with chicken and it was a great fit, I highly suggest it.  The rest of the menu looked amazing too, but Im not sure I could go there and not get the salad.  So I suggest going with multiple people, splitting the salad and then splitting another entree.   The decor of the place could probably use a little sprucing up and its a bit on the cheesy side.   Service wise was unfortunately not the greatest experience.  It was a slow time and we had a hard time getting our bill or being asked if we needed anything else.  Thus the deduction of a star.  But I would still give it another try just for the food."
3,"Dont get me wrong, White Chocolate Grill is good and definitely a place I will go back to, but there is something that just doesnt click. Everything tastes good and the service is fast and efficient but it is more of a relaxed dinner that a meal you get excited about. I cant say for everyone I really dont like waiting a half hour for a table. Call me impatient I dont care,  I really do not think many restaurants deserve that title even on a Friday night. I do love that they have an entire menu for gluten free diners. Its so hard to find gluten free in restaurants dont even mention an entire menu! I was impressed! I ended up splitting artichokes with parmesan (ask for no bread crumbs) with my mom and got myself a chicken caesar. Both were decent. We did end up ordering a gluten free chocolate soufflé (make sure to specify that you want it gluten free because they had a normal version as well) which was amazing and I would definitely go there just for that. Overall a good family weeknight restaurant that is that is above average meal. Definitely a place to go if you have celiacs or are gluten intolerant."
4,"Tried Bombay Spice last night. After reading the website and reviews, it seemed like it would fit perfectly our combined need to finally find good Indian fare in Phoenix AND not blow our calorie budget (husband and I are trying--and succeeding!-- in losing weight). Success on both counts! It was Saturday at about 6:30 and we were seated immediately. The place was almost full. We sat on the patio, which was lovely, but might get too hot during the summer (I didnt see any misters--Youre Welcome, Mother Earth!).   Service was attentive, and our waitress gave us several recommendations.  We ordered: Somosas (baked, I think, not fried, which made them a little messier to eat but still very very tasty). Naan (chewy, moist, naan-y...yum) Grilled Shrimp skewers (a little on the skimpy side, but very tasty, and served with grilled peppers and onions and a delightful mint sauce). We each ordered individual entrees with basmati. They encourage you to order the two-entree choice, but we were trying to avoid over-ordering, and it turned out to be exactly the right amount of food.  I ordered the Cauliflower and potatoes, which was moist, savory, a little spicy, and very tasty, albeit lacking a little in the sauce department (I would have liked a little something to spoon over my rice). Husband ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, which was exceptional. They claim that they dont use cream in their food, so I dont know how they made the masala sauce so creamy and good, but they did and Im not going to question it any more! I would have licked the bowl if we had been at home.  Next time I think well get some apps again but try the Bombay Plate to share, which is 5 entree choices and rice. That way we can try a whole bunch of things.  $35 before tip for naan, two appetizers, and two single-choice entrees. Not bad for a Saturday out. Well definitely be back, even though it was  kind of a drive for us."
5,"Do not bother going anywhere else. This is the place to go for laser. No contracts, easy to get appointments, very reasonable. The staff is fantastic, every one of them. I usually go to Kristen, but all others are as equally friendly and competent. Location is very convenient also. I have looked, and I have received many groupon and living social offers from other places, but I never bothered. This is the one."
4,"In a sentence: Culinary Dropout is a foodie mecca with its plush and lux furnishings, amazing location in the heart of Scottsdale but away from the duche-ery of Old Town, on point entrees that range from classic to what I call contemporary chef-y food, and its trendy lil touches like dishtowels for nanpkins and placemat menus.  After a short afternoon of shopping, I and the other Musketeers ventured into CD in search of yummy goodness... we werent disappointed. We scarfed down the Pretzel and cheese fondue. Sorry, I cant remember the exact cheese used, but it tasted like cheez whiz without the nasty chemical aftertaste.  Musketeer #1 had the Shrimp Po Boy sammy and was overwhelmingly awesome! With its fresh baguette, crispy shrimp and cole slaw topping, this po boy claimed to have died several times. The fries were good, Im sure they are awesome with the steak. Musketeer #2 had the truffle egg scramble. She said that it was good... not bad... but not terrific. We love the truffle, and this did deliver however... it just missed something... je ne sai quai... just something. I stole a bite and concurred... the low point in a overall great meal.  and me, Miss Musketeer #3 had the coq a vin... a MUST! If that or braised short ribs are on the menu... they MUST be ordered! Thats the rule my friends. My braised chicken was good, kind of on the sweet side, but over all very good, although the chicken did have an odd texture, it seemed to me that it could have used a few more hours in the oven. I think this is a dish best served before closing when all the flavors had their chance to really marry. We arrived at the top of dinner service and so the chicken was done... but barely. Musketeer #2 and I both NEEDED bread and butter, our cooler-than-thou waiter was happy to oblige, even though it took a VERY long time t find him to ask for it in the first place. We capped off the meal with their ""famous"" Monkey Bread, it was definatly worth going bananas over! Warm, gooey, delicious and crazy sweet with its pull-apart goodness it didnt need the ice cream it was served with, but we certainly werent about to send it back! The three of us died over that one!  To my yelpers I say: if you have the cash to spend (three of us cost a lil over a hundred clams), a few hours spend on dinner (we were there a while) and a NEED to reach foodie nirvana in order to keep from jumping off a cliff into the chain resturant valley... then this is the spot for you! Bring your most expensive IT bag, a pair of oversized shades, maybe a sweater (the outdoor heaters really didnt work) and your most predestroyed designer deconstructed jeans and get ready!! Its gonna be a blast!!"
4,"Burritooooooo lunch special!!!!! awesome, tons of chips and salsa"
3,"Today I was ready to be beside myself with glee as I took my daughters out for lunch. Ive been here several times for breakfast and lunch, and have never been disappointed. They have the BEST eggs!  I also love the layout and of course, the free wifi. August is their ""Burger Daze"", a different burger every day for the entire month. Todays burger was the wasabi burger, and being a fan of foods with kick, I was thinking about this burger since yesterday. It almost makes me cry to say I was underwhelmed by it. It was a burger with a creamy horseradishy sauce on it, and you got a little wasabi flavor, but it lacked that kick you get from eating wasabi. It also had an Asian salad mixture on the burger as well. Dont get me wrong, it was tasty, but when I think that I paid $11 for that and a side of potato chips, I feel a little slighted. If you eat ten of their burgers over the course of the month you can get a $25 gift card (save your receipts). The burger just wasnt good enough to get me to come back 9 more times this month.   Ill definitely return to Liberty Market again- as I said I do love the restaurant and would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to eat. However I think Ill stick to their breakfasts and other sandwiches. The three stars is for today only- next time I hope to come back here and give them a 5!"
5,"Of all the Chipotles I really like this one.  The staff is exceptionally friendly and I dont think Ive ever been in the place, and Ive""ve been a lot, where they werent meticulously cleaning the restaurant with soapy suds."
5,"What a brewpub should be.  The beers are great. The food, the Slingers (wow) & the service is all top rate.  Lisa, the server was very helpfull. I need say no more."
1,"My co-workers and I refer to this place as ""Pizza n Ants"".  The staff will be happy to serve you with bare hands, right after using the till.  Also, as the nickname suggests, there has been a noticable insect problem.  As if that could all be overlooked, the pizza isnt even good.  If you are in this part of town, go to Z Pizza or Slices for great pizza instead!"
5,"The Phoenix metro area is definitely not known for authentic Asian cuisine. China Magic Noodle House, however, is the real deal. This place reminds me of the Taiwanese delis that I used to go to in LA, as well as noodle houses that Ive frequented in Taipei. They have a great selection of cold noodle, hot noodle and soup noodle dishes. And, a variety of ways to have your noodles (I typically order the thick noodles or shaved noodles). Theres always a veggie on the whiteboard to try and the fried tofu is very tender and tasty with the dipping sauce. If youre looking for a reasonably priced, ethnically authentic meal in Phoenix (especially the East Valley), China Magic Noodle House should be near the top, if not first, on your list. the only negative that I would have about this place is that there isnt enough choices where chicken is the main protein."
5,"i love this place. i can always spent all my money here on something.  they have great sales racks, but also reasonable clothes not on sale too. the atmosphere is always chill and the people working are super friendly. Also if you get bored of shopping for clothes, they have random stuff like board games and books you can buy."
5,"I went in to check out the new drop of denim that the boys at The Phoenicia Association got in and left with a new pair of Naked and Famous Raw Selvedge Denim, Weird Guy cut; and a shirt by Wrath Arcane with the sickest little pocket that drops from your breast to your waist (perfect for my lighter and cigs) with a little zipper at the bottom. Spent a nice chunk of dough but nothing crazy for such a nice combo I can wear to dinner with the parents or to Old Town/Downtown on a Saturday night."
5,"I absolutely love Chompies! Its the closest thing to a New York style deli that I have found in Phoenix. They have a very large and extensive menu and everything Ive ordered has been really good. They also have an amazing bakery that offers a very large assortment of tasty treats such as black and white cookies, red velvet cake, enormous éclairs, napoleons, and New York style cheese cake. Id say that my favorite thing on the menu is the pastrami sandwich, although I recently tried the Jewish Sliders after seeing them on Man vs. Food. The sliders were really good, unlike any slider I have ever had. The challah bread and potato pancake gave these sliders a very unique flavor, very tasty. I also tried the Western Sliders and those are good as well.  Although I live closer to their new location in Chandler, I still go to the Tempe location because of the hot ASU waitresses. Chompies is the best!"
3,"It was nice but not a great experience.  The music was very loud.    The waitress was very helpful and knew the menu and the wines and made some good recommendations (love the Newton Chard).  We split a salad and a pizza.  The watermelon salad was an incredible medley of complex flavors - the red chili giving the watermelon, avocado and goat cheese some kick to offset the sweetness.  Very interesting.  We got the funghi trifolati pizza and it was just ok.  After the first wonderful taste of mushrooms, it was all very bland with nothing to make it stand out.  I think next time I would try sitting on the patio as that looked very inviting and relaxing."
4,"One of the best lunches Ive had in Phoenix. Im still thinking about the fried egg sandwich and fries. A fried egg- yolk just barely runny. Barely. Two thick-ass slabs of good-ass, smoky-ass bacon. Arugula and aioli on a really tasty ass bun. Damn, son. Good as hell. The french fries were so damn good, too, and you have to dip those in the remoulade to really enjoy them all the way.  I would come back for this sammich every day if I lived next door. Dont be afraid of it being called a fried egg sammich, because its a whole nother level."
5,I have been patronizing Casey Moores for 10 years and have never had a bad night!  Great for people watching and the service is always great!  Get there early or it will be standing room only!
4,"Have only been here once before under too stressful of circumstances to remember, this trip to Olive and Ivy was fantastic.  Usually going to lunch in Scottsdale is hit or miss with expectations, however today we had a lunch meeting scheduled for 11:30, I got a front row parking spot in front of the valet and had no problem being seated right away. Sticking to my lunch salad trend, I ordered the Curry Salad with Chicken and couldnt have asked for a more perfect dish on such a warm day. The portions were great, the lettuce cool and crisp and even the ""handmade"" bread and pesto before complimented everything perfectly.  The only gripe I would have, understanding it is a Fox Restaurant, was how almost unnatural the wait staff was with how rehearsed and methodical all interactions were. Even down to the correct usage of ""I am well"" versus ""I am good"" seemed a bit out of place, but not a big deal."
4,Last nights To-Go order:  Char Burger w/avocado. Burger was delicious ~ Yum!  Extra crispy french fries were perfect! Price was reasonable for a burger of this caliber.  No drive-thru No waiters Staff very friendly I WILL BE GOING BACK!!!!
3,"Last night (Friday night) was the first time I had been back to Myst in years. The club is nice, but the promoter for Friday nights is urban... and not classy urban... like kinda hood urban.... BUT I must say that its a fairly mixed crowd. Black... White... Hispanic... I was surprised to see all different types of hood folks out. Now, this usually wouldnt have been my crowd of choice, but my girlfriend and I were feeling adventurous.  Long story short, the bartender was awesome and the wait for drinks wasnt too bad. They averaged about $10/cocktail. The cover was $15 and $35 for VIP (which allows you access to upstairs... not worth it. Its a recession and the dance floor is downstairs...) Im not sure who the DJ was but he was really good. It was like all the best of Gucci Mane and all that Southern type club music... very good stuff.  I gave a rating of 3 stars b/c while this isnt a place many of my friends would want to go to in the future on this particular night, it was a decent night IF this is the crowd youre looking for. Hey folks... I dont judge lol..."
4,"This is an outer arts district staple in the Valley. The neighborhood is spooky if you dont know the area, but it is worth the possibility of having your car vandalized to stop in. Great live performances, mellow guitar, etc. and fantastic food. Hummus plate, Mm. Greek salad, yum. Cheesecake, yes please. The service is European style so expect to wait and wait some more. Seat yourself inside or out on the lovely patio. Across from a fun locally-owned boutique you can stop by if youre there earlier in the day.  I stocked up on the 70% off gift certificates for this little gem of a place at: http://www.citydeals.com/deals-merchant-Paisley-Violin-Cafe-Phoenix-AZ-LOC41462852.html?id=2852 You can thank me later. Ill probably be at the table next to you."
3,"First I will admit to not being a very impartial critic here-I absolutely adore a good bowl of ramen.  Although Ive not been to Japan Ive been fortunate enough to visit some outstanding ramen houses in Seattle, Honolulu, Los Angeles, Chicago, and San Jose. While I think this is probably some of the better ramen Ive had in Arizona, unfortunately thats not really saying much.  It was okay, not great. I ordered the miso ramen with chashu hoping against hope that Id have a reasonable facsimilie to Santoukas spicy miso available in the Mitsuwa stores around the country-drool.....  The noodles were decent, though I wish there was more of them.  The broth was not very miso-y and lacked the depth that really makes the ramen bowl.  The chashu was really the weak point, sliced thin pork with no real discernable chashu quality.  The accompanying vegetables were fine although I wouldnt say its what Im used to/looking for. In short Id say this is Americanized ramen-and no, not the cheap junk from the package but suited more for an American palate instead of leaning toward authenticity.  No fish cake or bamboo shoots, none of the cloudy unctuous broth, no pork belly chashu. The place looks great and the staff is great, I wouldnt dismiss it but Republic doesnt get a fervent recommendation either."
3,"First visit...Had lunch here today - used my Groupon.   We ordered the Bruschetta, Pretzels and Steak & Cheese Calzone. -We both thought there was WAY too much Balsamic used.  Also, we expected mozzarella cheese - not Feta. -We tried the butter and salt pretzel & cinnamon sugar with honey pretzel.  They were okay. They should have kept the honey on the side like they did for the mustard. -The calzone was good. We liked the dough and it was fairly well filled/stuffed. Overall, we thought it was average as far as the food is concerned - and a little pricey for quality and portions. We have another Groupon to use so maybe well try a pizza for the next one."
4,"I dont know what it is about Tempe Sales, but how can you not love them? it is primarily a fabric store, and they may or may not have all kinds of other random stuff, like carved wooden chairs, stone tabletops, bamboo flooring (sadly no longer in stock), slate tiles, and so on. However, I would say that its not merely the random selection of home decorating supplies and upholstery tools/materials that makes Tempe Sales great. Its the family-run vibe that you get from them. On one trip, to pick up several cases of flooring material, I had to go with the owner Alan to his warehouse down the street. In light of buying as much as I did and helping pull it from the warehouse, he threw in plenty of sublayment material for free (otherwise on closeout). The staff (many of whom are part of the family) have also helped me reupholster furniture and work on plenty of other odd jobs. There is no shame in being an amateur at Tempe Sales, even though it is primarily geared toward professionals. If youre in the market for fabric, please do yourself a favor and check it out. I bet that you will return soon thereafter just to browse around some more. The only downsides that come to mind also make the experience more interesting -- stock levels are not always reliable and parts of the store have historically been disorganized (much better now than in the past), but my experience may be skewed since I gravitate toward closeout deals."
1,"F724  She didnt even look at me, didnt bother asking why I was entering her place of business, didnt reply when I spoke and in no way acknowledged that I was even in her presence. Just handed me a ticket and was done with me. If this happened anywhere else, I would make an effort to never return, tell all my friends how horrible this experience was, and write a scathing review about the deplorable customer service of this business. Sadly, this was my Saturday morning at the DMV, a place I think is modeled after the agonizing depths of Hell. With the same musac score playing...and the same voracious stench in the air..and the same spastic children running around (only in my version of Hell, its politicians campaigning around me).  So, I was already running late because I had to complete my emissions test early. Those nice people there not only told me there were only three DMVs open on Saturdays, they gave me a map. How precious. I was fortunate enough to be near one of the only DMVs open on Saturday (Seriously? Three DMVs open on Saturday for the entire Valley?) After receiving such a magnificent welcome, I knew this was quickly going to be among the most painful experiences of my life. To simplify what was so bad, let me make a list of what I feel constitutes acceptable behavior in public:  1) Bathe. The combination of water and soap, along with massaging the skin, creates an outcome that is most pleasing. Be sure to scrub behind your ears and reference this website about another notorious spot : http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/htf/755891987.html  2) Sit still. Yes, I know were all waiting here for about an hour. But tapping your foot, rocking back and forth in your chair or bouncing your leg arent going to make time go any faster. Trust me, I was watching the clock. If you feel anxious, get up and walk around.  3) Leash your children. If they cannot sit quietly, leave them in the car. Its winter, theyll be fine. Its not cute when your little monster is running up and down the aisles with his honey bun squeezing out between his fingers. Its even more not cute when he fake-falls five times in a row right in front of me.  4) Maintain quiet tones and ensure appropriate conversations when taking/making calls. To the lady behind me, Im sorry youre not that experienced in stripping. The first thought that popped into my mind was you had a failed audition for Le Girl. Thanks to your continued conversation, I was able to figure out you were a woodworker.  5) Acknowledge the humans around you. Yeah, I get it. Im not that big. In fact, if I turn sideways I disappear. But, Im still right in front of you so pay attention, quit bumping in to me and hitting my leg. Unless that was flirting, in which case you really need to find someone more your level.  Oh, the DMV: You have a brilliant recipe for dashing dreams and gutting humanity. And you manage to do it in a painfully lit room that reeks of a combination of my brothers old gym shoes and my dads dirty underwear. There has to be an award for that, but I dont have the motivation to research it.  Oh, and F724 was my number upon entering. I spent and hour and 15 minutes looking at that slip of paper. Just so you know, that one star is for the website (which should probably get 3-4 stars but anchors like this oft sink the ship).    Le sigh...  Open T-Sa 8:00am - 5:00pm; information only after 4:30pm"
5,Great Job!
5,"I was in this area and went here for lunch today based on the Yelp reviews. I had a molete and lengua, fish, and pastor tacos. Washed it all down with a Mexican coke, made an awesome lunch! Everything was so good I ordered a shrimp burrito to go and shared it with a friend after I left. Ill be back to try more things next time Im in the area!"
2,"After reading many decent reviews and seeing how close the restaurant was to home, I decided to give it a try. The young lady at the counter was impatient and had no interpersonal skills. The food was just not good; this place is Chinese take-out at best."
4,"I havent had this in a while so I cant really give a ton of detail but I have been here a few times. Its a traditional japanese restaurant and from what I remember the food was decently priced maybe a little more expensive for dinner than other places. The thing I remember about this place that I really liked were the lunch bento boxes. They had a ton of food and miso soup and all that and they were a great deal, I dont know how much they were but it was very cheap for what you get. The service is only average but for a cheap lunch with more traditional sushi I would definitely hit this place up."
5,"I am 50"", so I require a lot of alterations and it is essential that I have a good alteration service.  I will never go anywhere other than Elegant Reflections for my tailoring services.  I have had innumerable pairs of pants hemmed here and have been completely satisfied.  They have nice private dressing rooms with real doors (I refuse to undress behind nothing more than a curtain), everyone on staff is competent and very friendly, the prices are reasonable, and they are almost always able to complete your alterations in less than a week. I have only ever encountered one issue..when I had two pair of very thick trousers hemmed with a cuff at the bottom, the cuff seemed loose.  Since I didnt want it to get caught on something and come apart, I took them back to be adjusted.  The second alteration was done in just a couple days (in winter, which tends to be a busy busy time for them) and the new stitching was nearly indestructible! The staff here also seems to have an exceptional memory, because even after a year hiatus- they greeted me by name!"
5,"OK, so this is how much I love this product. I first tasted Lees at a Yelp Elite event and waited and dreamed a whole year to eat it again. When I was invited to the next years Elite Pleydate it was the topic of the first question out of my mouth. ""Is Lees gonna be there?"" ( Ok, maybe the whole French restaurants Bone Marrow gravy came to mind too, but I digress) When I made it inside to Pleydate I literally ran to that booth having desert before dinner. I am all about the alcohol infused ice cream now. The funny thing about that is I am not even a big ice cream lover. I will have to visit the shop soon."
4,"Thanks to Frys, I felt like I was on vacation today as I traipsed around in the rainforest with the Aztec computer geeks.  Theres something just cool about walking into a snakes maw to listen to stereo equipment.  The outside is just as lovely to look at. Now as far as the store itself... ...the cafe was a joke - out of cream cheese for their bagels.  Who runs out of cream cheese by 10am on a Saturday?  Coffee machine broken...dont they sell those things?  Couldnt they just demo one from off the shelf? ...it felt like at least half of the workers knew what they were talking about - which is actually (maybe even sadly) better than some electronics stores Ive been to.  They didnt try to talk down to me because I was young or a girl. ...prices were cheaper for some of the items I looked at ...no restocking fee for returned electronics. So in the end, the unique look of the store boosted it up to a four, silly enough as that sounds.  It was refreshing to be in there, and my bullsh*t radar didnt go off as loudly as it did when I was in the Baseline location.  Good thing I wasnt rating just the cafe, they wouldve gotten a two."
5,Love this place...cant beat it for a healthy meal. Tons of good options that are tasty without all the cheese.
2,"Get the White Chocolate but leave the Strawberries and Cream flavor, too faux-berry/chemical tasting."
4,"I was in Arcadia today and saw this place so I had to try it out. The menu has some variation from the normal Thai restaurant as well as some classics. I decided to try the jalapeno curry. I was surprised it was not as spicy as I expected but the flavor was excellent. Service in this place could not have been better, everyone was very friendly and attentive. Lunch prices were very good for the quality of the food and was an excellent value in my opinion. Ill definitely be back to try some more new things."
4,I had the fruits of the forest flavor and really enjoyed it.  Staff was very helpful.  Will definitely be coming back.
5,"I pride myself on being that girl that tries out every restaurant I come across. Its practically a hobby for me. For YEARS I kept saying, ""I want to go to Cowboy Ciao"" but we never made it. Then, thankfully, the hubs best friend had a big birthday dinner there, so we just HAD to go. (Thank you hubs best friend!) I have to say that the service was incredible, and the menu was almost overwhelming. There were SO many interesting choices, but I had to stick to the tried and true chopped salad - everyone and their mother has told me about this salad, and I wasnt about to miss out. The hubs ordered the Tenderbelly Pork Shank.  The chopped salad has earned its reputation. That thing is de-freaking-licious. The Pork Shank dish was fabulous as well, but I couldnt get over how great the salad was! AND the server always came over to make sure that my wine glass was never empty. Seriously, can it get any better? For dessert we ordered the spumoni- I have had better (no offense) but Im not sure anything served after that salad would have made me happy :) Im very glad we finally made it to Cowboy Ciao and I look forward to going back - SOON!"
4,Had the signature Black Chile entree.  It was fabulous!
4,"Its an airport, and what exactly does one look for/expect from such an establishment? Currently I want free wi-fi most. Free wi-fi at Sky Harbor... Check. Secondly, convenient economy parking is a must. Convenient economy parking at Sky Harbor... Check. Not to mention the shuttle drivers are always friendly and small talk-ready. The TSA folks here also seem to smile and playfully banter with travelers more readily than at other airports. Perhaps this is due in part to Sky Harbors ""Americas Friendliest Airport"" marketing ploy, but in any case its certainly something to remark about. I doubt Phoenix will turn into any sort of true travel hub in the near future, but more non-stop international flights would certainly be welcomed. But until the demand is clearly defined well have to be content with a few flights to Europe, Canada, Mexico, and the lone wolf to Costa Rica. I am very excited to see the Sky Train completed and operational with Stage One scheduled to be up and running in 2013. This will allow connections from the light rail and offer a new mode of transportation from the east economy lot to terminal 4. Ive seen previous reviews complaining about having to go back through security when changing terminals, which is actually the case in many airports throughout the world. The terminal is the secure area so whenever you leave it you naturally have to be screened again. There are a few exceptions, but the easiest way to circumvent this is to fly the same airline from point A all the way to point B. If youre connecting at Sky Harbor you should only be flying US Airways/United or Southwest so as to avoid a terminal change. If youre not flying these carriers then youre over-complicating things for yourself and you should look for different routing. The central location of Sky Harbor makes it extremely accessible for people living in most parts of the valley, which is a huge plus considering the location of other airports outside of their corresponding metropolitan areas. All in all, theres really nothing significant to complain about Sky Harbor. P.S. The Fox Sports Grill at Sky Harbor is a true embarrassment, not that one should expect a great deal from airport restaurants, but if Kraft Mac-N-Cheese (this is probably a poor example as KMNC provides a perfect vehicle for some truly delicious creations) is far superior to what youre serving, then you should just end it all. Fact."
3,"Why review a fast food chain?  For me, this particular Sonic is close to where I work.  Because there arent many options when pressed for  time Im able to walk or drive here and grab a quick bite to eat.  Like most fast food chains its about consistency, knowing what youre going to get and getting it quickly.  Thats what this Sonic location does well.  Plus, who can pass up hot and crispy Tater Tots?? 3 stars because, on principle, I think thats the most any fast food place can reasonably expect."
4,"Even though there are only two things on the menu that I can eat, theyre damned tasty and the service is incredibly fast.  I am a bit surprised by all the five stars though, you people do realize that this is just a chain sandwich joint, right?"
2,"best luck to wait in line for a guy behind the desk.  The other two sales associates were too busy posing as customers in an empty store to acknowledge the one customer, me, that was there.  This is a real change from some other verizon stores where somebody greets you, gives you a number, and the associates talk to customers and want you to buy their products.  Weird vibe in this store."
5,"I was thrilled to find my room huge, sheets crisp and clean, and the staff super friendly."
5,Pure Bliss - I havent had a quality meal experience like this in a very very long time.   The full 4 course dinner was stupendous and well worth every cent.  You MUST try the Yin & Yang Martini!  It was  a very creative and well presented drink  that had me all smiles.   I had the Smores & Chocolate desert and it was hands down my favorite (Ive tried at least 5 others).
3,"A decent southwestern restaurant if you have a hankering for it.  The margarita was good and the Taos combo was also good.  The service was attentive and bumped this up to a three star review.  Otherwise, the food is good not great."
1,"I play squash racquets, a sport favored by the east coast ""elites"" from them Ivy League schools, those snooty Britishers and the Pakistani leisure class:)  Why they let me play, Ill never know:) Last evening, we had a little tourney in which a group of us from the Village traveled to the outer reaches of Tempe to play a group from Lifetime Fitness:) It was a jolly good, show, ever so much fun and our Village group gave the Lifetime group a bit of a ""Rodgering"":) So it was with happy hearts and high spirits that we headed down the street to the post tourney repast at Skip & Jans...let me start by saying that the Lifetime group picked this place, and its almost like they knew they were going to lose and wanted to select a venue that would be the grimiest, greasiest, grubbiest, grossest spot to try to eat...they succeeded:) Where to start...I know...the parking lot:) When we arrived, the total Kelly Blue Book value of the 50-60 cars in the parking lot was about $832...we raised that by several orders of magnitude, just by driving in...this parking lot hasnt seen a lot of traffic from the Mercedes/BMW/Lexus/Jaguar crowd (and may never again:) After I safely parked a block or 2 away, I went inside and took in the look and feel of S&J...crappy old wood paneling...tables and chairs from a circa 1955 high school cafeteria...an intriguing mix of flat panel TVs, regular TVs and OTB results screens (yeah, you can bet the ponies here...the sport of Kings, in a slightly less than ""regal"" atmosphere:) They must have 20-25 pool tables...faded felt...and a whole bunch of people playing pool (and frankly looking like they werent enjoying themselves...extremely tight and serious expressions on the faces of the people playing and watching...arent games supposed to be fun? :-)...I suspect there was gambling going on:) The smell in S&J can only be described as ""extreme humanity""...the place smelled like it has seen a centurys worth of spilled beer, cigarette smoke, BO, vomit, urine, spoiled food and every other aroma that humans create for themselves...remarkable, given the fact that this place cant have been here for more than a few years...how did they do that so quickly? :-) S&J has menus, they have some sort of kitchen, they have Jagermeister on ""tap"", they have a bunch of beers on tap and they had a buffet (or ""boofay"" for my friend Ryan C) set up for our group. It was supposed to be a Taco Bar:) S&J provided a table full of taco ""fixins""...the centerpiece of which was the taco meat hot tray...Holy Crap, was that disgusting! :-( They told us it was ground beef, but I know my beef, and I dont think this was it...this was ground ""creature""...possibly some sort of unfortunate non-distinct animal which happened to be near the kitchen when duty called. I kid, of course...as far as I know, this was indeed, ""beef""...just not very good ""beef"":( The hot tray holding the ""meat"" looked like a relief map of the Hawaiian Islands...small mountains of ""meat"" rising out of the ocean of brown/orange grease that was the real body of the dish:( But, I was starving (a banana for breakfast and nothing else) so I tried to make a taco. I decided to forgo the slotted spoon that everyone was trying to use to fish some meat out of the soupy brine, and use some tongs instead...my idea was to try to squeeze as much grease out of the concoction as possible...I was sort of successful, but in doing so, I probably squeezed any flavor out as well:( I got back to the table and tried a bite...not good...I added several shakes of Cholla and tried another bite...and that was that:( One of my buddies had decided to forgo the mystery meat tacos and ordered wings from the menu and offered me one...Im not sure what the deal with the wings was, but the wing I tried seemed to be boiled (no, not ""broiled""...boiled) and then dipped in buffalo sauce...not crispy, just wet...all the way through:) Then they announced that Karaoke was going to start soon...and that was enough for me:( Adding amateur singing to this tableau would have just been too much:) Still, its not all bad news...the tires and wheels were still on my car when I was ready to leave...I didnt become immediately ill (although I had kind of a rough morning, this morning). They say shared adversity can make teams grow together, so I think I should thank S&J for making the Village Squash group nearly invincible:)"
2,What a lame store.  The employees didnt say hi to me once and were totally unhelpful.  Their dog food selection is decent but their dog toy selection is worse than PetSmart.  Too bad too because good quality pet stores are hard to find.  There has to be something else around here and I would go out of my way to find it.
4,"I havnet been into Radio Milano quite as many times as I have been into Postino, but I have to say of those times I have, I was impressed. They have complimentary valet parking which in this neighborhood is a huge plus! Their menu has many different dishes to choose from along with the daily special that always sounds great. The other night when some friends and I stopped in the special was short rib ravioli, yum right? Well, I wasnt able to fiund out, as they were sold out for the evening. I instead got the linguini with clams, and I am glad I did. One of the tastiest things I have eaten in awhile. It was with a light cream/butter sauce with garlice and leeks and clams. If you like clams I would deffinatly recomend this dish, its perfect! They also have some interesting things on the menu you I am excited to try next time I stop in; deviled eggs, olive oil cake, and their mac n cheese. Their wine list was nice, decently priced as well. Radio Milano has a warm cozy inviting feel, anyone can have a good time. Just be mindfull that it is an open room, and talking to your neighbor as if you were at a football game is not the most polite thing to do. I wish the ladies that were out for a batchlorette party that night could have gotten the memo, ""they were loud"" is an understatment. None the less, we had a great dinner."
3,"My hubby&I were in for lunch-approx 1:30PM. Was just us and 1 other customer. Ordered tuna salad sandwich&potato salad. Hubby ordered the cheeseburger&fries. Refills on my tea were not fast enough for me,I had to find someone. Hubby loved his burger,Angus I think. My homemade potato salad was not seasoned-loved the texture, but had to add salt&pepper for any flavor. A few ""quotes"" written on the walls was part of the decor. One from the class of the local high school has a misspelled word!!!! ""anticipate"" They put it up last Sept and its still wrong. Everything we ordered came as we asked for;server got it right. We might be back another time."
5,"I eat here frequently as I stay at the adjoining Hilton when Im in town, and the breakfast vouchers are generous. The steak and eggs ($15) features a good cut of meat (I think its a flank steak), 2 eggs anyway you want them, with corn salsa and toast and potatoes. The servers are always amenable to allowing me to change out the sides for lots of fruit. I love the mustard available at the table, the fact that they have Chilulah hot sauce on hand, and will bring out some salsa at no extra cost. The staff are pretty attentive.  I call ahead to avoid having to wait in the breakfast rush. I have also had an omelet which was substantial in size and quite tasty, with unlimited ingredients for about $12."
3,"Playable muni track for players of all abilities.  If youve never played golf, this would be a good course to learn at.  For low handicappers, its birdie paradise.  Kenny Mac has a large chipping green and two putting greens, as well as a driving range equipped with crappy range balls and mats which I refuse to use.   The course itself is wide and flat, and is certainly not a destination golf course.  The fairways have generous landing areas and the rough is hardly penal, while the greens are mostly accessible and large.  During the summer time, the fairways run out and the course plays extremely short.   Bonus 1/2 star for having lovely cart girls."
2,"Im generally very fond of Rubios, but this location just isnt up to snuff. The food is good, but somehow not quite as good as other locations (it doesnt seem as fresh). The restaurant isnt as clean as it should be, the tables are always kind of sticky, and the restroom... well, it smells like swamp gas (and not just once). Also some of the seats are town and have been ""repaired"" with large amounts of tape (the tape is worn and sticky and if youre a dude wearing shorts, it will pull the hair right off your leg!) ...To be fair, I guess it could pull the hair off a non-dudes leg too, but lets just not go there."
5,Cholla Trail is a lot of fun and moderate hike. Echo Canyone is a lot of fun but also more challenging. Overall both trails are so much fun and a great workout.
4,"There are so many good things to say about AJs, its hard to know where to start. Amazing meats and seafood. Great deli items. Great sushi bar. Knowledgeable staff. Fantastic produce. Gorgeous flowers. And the pastries... the list just goes on and on.  There is usually a somalier on staff to help with wine selections to go with whatever cut of meat or seafood choice youve gone with. A good mix of everyday grocery items as well as specialty items. If you can find the marinated garlic, try it! Its so so good. Try the butternut lasagna if the deli has it. And the pastries... The pastries. Cheesecakes, mini red velvet cakes, Boston Cream Pies, cupcakes, croissants, bagels... All of the highest quality. You will never have a problem finding something sweet to curb that craving, except that you may have a problem narrowing the field.  Note: not every AJs has a sushi bar, so keep that in mind if you head to a different location with a hankering for fresh sushi.  No matter what youre going in for, the friendly, helpful staff will help ensure you get exactly what you need."
5,"Hard to find New York pizza that tastes like New York pizza.  All the way from Morristown, NJ, this place is now the only place I order NY style pizza."
5,"I cant believe some of the things Ive been seeing people NAG about in their reviews for this new restaurant! I set my standards pretty high for Rice Paper and they did not disappoint!  I took my wife on a date here last night because she really loves beef pho, and had been waiting for this place to open up! The atmosphere was very bright and welcoming, as well was our server! He sat down with us and quickly went over what was good and what was popular with most patrons so far. We took him up on a few of his suggestions and started with the fried calamari. Im not sure what they bread it with but it was delicious, and the squid was perfect; not too soft, not too chewy! For our main course I ordered the Shaking Beef, which was cubed filet mignon served over onions on a sizzling platter in a special sauce, with a side of rice and grilled zuchinni... again on the suggestion of my server! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND! My wife got the beef pho... at first I was a bit iffy on it because the broth looked very clear as if it were going to be somewhat watery... but it was VERY well seasoned! Our server told us that the broth stews for at least 12 hours allowing it to achieve the best flavor from the pho spices! VERY IMPRESSED!  Yes, it is much pricier than your average pho joint, but Id rather pay a bit extra for a nice, clean and slightly upscale atmosphere! And the quality of the food is MUCH higher than the mystery meat youll get in your bowl of pho at some other places!  Well done Rice Paper, we WILL be back!"
4,"Sorry, had to deduct a star because its freakin EXPENSIVE for lawn seats. Really Glendale? Youre gonna charge $13 for lawn seats?  Its a BEAUTIFUL facility! Plenty of grass, plenty of seats, plenty of shade, and a plethora of food choices... all which perfectly align with the baseball experience."
5,"We love 5th and Wine and recommend it to anyone that asks, the appetizers and wine specials for Happy Hour are some of the best in town. Lets start off with the fact that every glass of wine on the wine list, thats right every glass, is just $5 during Happy Hour from 3 - 6 pm. Did someone mention appetizers? Yep, 5th has you covered there too. Ever tried Fried Pickles? Love them! But I have to admit it took some convincing to win us over... thanks Scott! The fried pickles are thinly cut, fried to perfection and served with a creamy horseradish sauce for dipping. But what 5th and Wine is really known for at Happy Hour is their Bruchetta. They have 6 types to try but may we recommend this selection of our favorites: Apple and Brie; Tomato, Basil and Mozzarella; and the Steak and Horseradish. Its a great threesome! As someone mentioned last night, the bread is not too hard, very flavorful and toasted just right. Read the entire review here... http://schmoozeaz.com/blog/?p=680"
2,"I was working for a non-profit organization and Amare was actually there. He was gracious enough to take a few pictures with some of our children who are clients, which was nice of him.  But, as far as the food goes - its bland. Ive been here on two separate occassions other than work, and while the atmosphere is beautiful (the seats and booths are roomy and comfy and there are even more seats that stretches out to the back, leading to a small ""VIP"" section), the food is just not that great."
4,"What a nice surprise! My car was actually washed at a car wash! So I drove up , a nice man help me choose which wash to get on the drive up teller like screen. I drive around the corner and am stopped just before entry to the drive through wash, where a guy sprays my windshield with some pretty potent bug dissolver and pre-soaks the rest of the car and tires as well, I then drive through the tunnel of wash and when I exit, I get hand dried and armour-all jet sprayed on my tires.   Very Fast and Very Clean! .........Very Impressed!  Minus one star because they dont do inside, but thats OK I keep it pretty clean!"
4,"This mall is HUGE for a mall this big I think they should have more directories but nope they want me to get lost in this mall. This mall has plenty of stores and a bunch of designers, you can probably find something for everywhere here whether you want a coach bag or a bag at forever 21. I especially loved how the Sur La Table here had a cooking class going on and you can see the kitchen as you walked around the store. There were plenty of food options and so many stores here that it was easy to get lost. There was a windows store here which is a big plus since I have never been there. Even though I personally didnt find anything here for me there was still a big wide variety."
5,Great eats at this joint. New York strip was awesome! Pear salad was bomb and service was superb. Ill be back march 10th!
5,"This is a GREAT place to eat! One of my favorite lunch stops as you can see if you follow my facebook photos ""Lunch With Stew"". My favorite thing there is the Buffalo Chicken Pizza. mmmmm, mmm. Kevin ODonnell is from the Texas Holdem family of final tables and occasionally will play the tour. Super great guy and he also has a super great restaurant and sports bar."
2,"Way overpriced. Wide selection. Good to browse, not to buy. Check out your local mexican market."
2,"I initially visited Daily Dose about a year ago after a night out.  I was only able to stomach some coffee and a few bites of breakfast nachos that morning, so I wanted to come back for a real (sober) meal.  Alas, they made a better impression on my first visit, headache and all. My recent visit was on a Sunday, around 11:30am, and surprisingly there wasnt a line.  We had a 5 min wait though, so we helped ourselves to water & coffee from the pitchers outside.  When we were called to our table I was a little disappointed - the table was tiny and squeezed between the door to the front patio and a servers station - but I let it go.  My son knew he wanted a cheeseburger and I finally decided on the Ancho-chile corned beef sandwich with sweet potato fries.  Yes, this was going to be a cheat day! Our waitress seemed.... off, and lacking personality.  She didnt take our menus after wed ordered and there was no where to put them on the tiny table, so they ended up propped up against the window.  Same thing with our paper cups wed brought in from outside - they sat next to the menus the whole meal.  The wait for our meals was a little long in my opinion - about 35 minutes.  During that time, our waitress was completely MIA and our drinks sat almost empty.  Thankfully, the guy who finally brought out our food was nice enough to refill them.   So, I thought corned beef rubbed with ancho chili spice and topped with sauerkraut on rye was going to be a bomb of savory, tangy, spicy flavor!  But.... not, not at all.  What in the hell do you do to sauerkraut to make it BLAND?  How do you make these yummy ingredients just completely flat??  Frankly, I was PISSED I wasted so many calories on this sandwich.  I ate half because I was really hungry but didnt even bother to take the other half home.  On a more positive note, the sweet potato fries were excellent. Feeling unfulfilled, I decided to try my sons cheeseburger.  Even though it was from the kids menu, the burger was ENORMOUS and they sure didnt skimp on his fries either.  Sadly, the burger was also really under-seasoned and I honestly wondered if theyd seasoned it at all.  The pretzel-bread bun was the most flavorful part of the burger - it was yum! About 15 minutes after our food came out, the waitress finally came by.  I asked her for a box (for my sons burger) and the check, which she brought to us at the speed of light.  I was very surprised to see Id been charged $2.50 for a glass and a half of lukewarm, weak iced tea.  If Id known that, I wouldve ordered a Tecate light for the same price.  Anyway, I got the distinct impression she wanted us to leave so her table could be re-seated with people who would drink and rack up a bigger bill.  Her loss, as I usually tip very generously when Im out with my son.  Overall, I was just totally bummed with Daily Doses food, service, and value - and bummed my 100th Yelp review only deserves 2-stars."
4,"I love an Irish pub, and I love me some Fibber Magees. My trips are fewer now that I live out in East Hell (Queen Creek), but when I lived in Chandler @ Dobson & Warner, I visited much more often. I still love the feel of this place - the dark wood, the high round tables. I feel like I am back in Dublin. I used to get the bangers & mash every time I visited, but the past few times my most recent time I went with fish & chips - one of my favorites. I didnt see the bangers on the menu this time, so it may have been changed. The full Irish Breakfast is exactly like I had back at the Tyrrellspass Castle Restaurant on my way to Galway, Ireland.  Wash it down with a Guinness or a Black & Tan. Sláinte!"
5,Jakes been taking care of our cars for almost 7 years. Hes very trustworthy and fair.
1,"First off the woman who answers the phone is not impressive at all.   I called to consign my furniture and when I asked her about some info on the store,, she said "" do you want to consign your table or not!"".  Quite rude.  That was a turn of for me..... The next day I went in the store for some info but when I entered I knew this wasnt the right fit for my Robb & Stucky table.  The place had older style furniture..dated couches, florals, mauves.  There was one accessory that I would  buy in the whole store.   Needless to say, I wont be coming back or consigning my table or anything else...rude stuff + gross stuff...what more can I say!"
5,"Recently I had the pleasure of eating at this great new Iron Chef Jose Garces restaurant. Pulling up to the front entrance to the restaurant my girlfriend and I were greeted by extremely nice doorman who valet our vehicle for us. We were a bit concerned that we were going to get wet from the rain on this day, but thanks to the valet service the hotel & restaurant provide we stayed warm and dry! Now I must say we were taken back from the decor inside the restaurant... It was spectacular!! The way the restaurant is decorated just puts a smile on your face! Also, it gives you a feel for Iron Chef Jose Garces personality which seems to be light and fun. The food is absolutely amazing!! We split the ""IGNACIO"" Nachos which have black beans, tomato, queso mixto, jalapeño, chile de arbol, and radish, and the Barbbacoa ""Costillas"" berkshire pork spare ribs, chipotle-cider mustard bbq they were tender, juicy, and delicious! We tried the House Margarita the ""Distrito"" and the white ""Mexican Sangria"" both were spectacular!! I have never heard of a white sangria before.. But WOW it was amazing! All of the employees we encountered were extremely nice, knowledgeable, and sincere. This restaurant will definitely stay on my regular to do list! Thanks to everyone who gave us a wonderful experience!!!"
4,"ive been a mojo fan since... well, since mojo first became mojo. when yogurtology opened right up the street from my house, i arched a skeptical brow and decided to give the mojo-wannabe a try.  *long sigh* my newfound love of yogurtology has me feeling a little guilty, as if ive replaced an old love with a new one. such is life, i suppose. the facts: yogurtology has a wide range of excellent flavors of frozen yogurt that seem to rotate daily. ive seen chocolate mint, oreo, cupcake batter, red velvet, chocolate peanut butter, mango, blackberry, oatmeal cookie and vanilla bean, to name a few. each and every one delish. they also seem to always have at least one non-dairy option available... the toppings are plentiful and varied. choose from fresh fruit, chopped candy bars, m&ms, nuts, baklava, brownies, truffles, cheesecake, sprinkles galore, ginormous marshmallows and gummy candy... ive never seen so many topping options in one place. staff are very friendly and attentive. a little TOO attentive for my taste, but hey, im the kind of person who likes to be left alone unless i ask for help...overall, they rock! loyalty punch-card? you betcha. so eat and eat and eat and score yourself some free yogurtology before starting the tasty process all over again. lick a spoon and feed your grin. lola"
4,"mmmm, Canadian comfort food! Were huge Keg fans, and when we moved from Canada to Tempe earlier this month we had to take the kids to the Keg.  I love how consistent they are with the quality of service and the extras for the kids.  The service is a little lacking compared to most Canadian Kegs Ive been to, simply because the staff seemed so much younger and less professional, but it was still really good.  The food quality was excellent, but the portions are very Canadian (read: smaller than US portions) while the prices are still what you would expect from Vancouver yet in an area where the cost of living is about 1/3rd.  For the money, Id probably rather hit Ruths Chris..minus the kids :)"
4,"Their pizza needs to be in your mouth. BUTTERY crust. Like, butter buttery. And its superb reheated at home in the toaster oven."
5,Love Krista!
2,"i am so disappointed with this place. they consistently do a half a--ed job. after many disappointing visits i decided no more wasting money on crappy car washes from there. alas, i ended up with a free car wash (fill up your gas tank 9 times, get a free wash!) so i gave them another chance. upgraded it to the vip (the ""best"") wash for $8 more. also had the floor mats shampooed at $1 each. the floor mats were filthy when the car went in and spotless when they were replaced in the car - what a bargain! if only the rest of the car turned out the same.  when returned to me a good 40-45 minutes later, the inside of my little car was still quite dirty, a good amount of dog hair remained, and the center area where the cupholders, change tray and gear shifter are werent wiped down. let me tell you, there was definitely reason to clean those areas. dannys started the job, but never finished, and lucky me! i got to spend more time on sunday to complete cleaning my car. i paid $12, but should have paid $22. at either price this remains a very poor value."
4,"Hard to miss with a Centurion guarding the entrance.   I wished it was nice patio weather.  The place was very cozy and a little uncomfortable padded banko seating.  If the tables were only several inches higher, it would have been better!   First off, we ordered Baked Brie and Raspberry  wrapped in puff pastry hors doeuvres with a side of grapes.  A couple of glasses of light and fruity red Portugal wines paired well.  ""Can I have some lemonade?"", nope, no lemonade.  ""How about Sprite?"", sorry, no Sprite.  So sad to see the look on cutie pies face.  Even wine bars would have had something for him to drink.  ""Okay, water is fine.""  He gloomly said.  We promised him an Italian soda next door at Lolas.  He cheered up. Killer pizzas, so Ive heard.  We decided to order the Mozarella, basil (pesto instead), white truffle oil pizza.  The crust is amazingly toasty outside and soft and flaky inside.  Good 14"" inches for $12 pie!   We added Risotto with manchego cheese/chorizo.  It was very, very, very rich!  It was so rich, I wanted to reach for some bread to sop it up! We were so full and carbo-ed up!  We didnt balance out our meals very well.   Good thing we took the lightrail downtown.  We needed to do a lot of walking after all that eating! Kudos to the chef and the hostess/server, they were absolutely wonderful.  Donec obviam redimus!"
3,"The food is solid, but not awesome.  The room is kind of ugly and occasionally not too fragrant. If you want Vietnamese, you want it dirt cheap and you want it now, this place gets it done. If you want a warm, memorable dining experience, this is not the place."
3,"Honestly, I love cupcakes. Like I said in my Wicked Bakery review, eating a cupcake, unlike a slice of cake, gives one a sense of accomplishment. I like cupcakes. I like the sense of accomplishment you get from eating a cupcake. You may have had a hard day, but you finished an entire cupcake. Thats validation. It makes me happy. Sprinkles is a great place to go for a sugar fix, but I have to say there are some negatives. I have had a dry cupcake there. They are a bit on the expensive side. The worst sin of all? Their red velvet is ""a southern style light chocolate cake with a cream cheese frosting"". I have to disagree. I dont detect any cream cheese flavor in that frosting. The first time I devoured a Sprinkles cupcake it was magical. I was particularly impressed with the black and white- ""Belgian dark chocolate with creamy vanilla frosting"". I was in a shoebox Los Angeles apartment and the cupcakes seemed of adequate size. The next time was the new location  am currently reviewing and they were consumed in a larger-than-shoebox Chandler house. They seemed a little small. The third time was in my car- a Subaru Baja, and the cupcakes, again seemed sizable. Id have to think that consuming a Sprinkles cupcake in an SUV would not be a great idea- the cupcake to eating space ratio would be all off.  For true cupcake validation, Ill drive the 35.9 miles to Wicked. Ok- you caught me. I might stop by for an emergency fix if I happen to be in the area, but Ill be thinking of Slade at Wicked... and Ill be consuming my confection in a small space."
2,"Not impressed, loud atmosphere, bland overpriced sandwiches. 10 employees behind the counter and no clean tables. How many people does it take to make a sandwich? More like the employees are just here to hang out with each other than work."
2,"After hearing a lot about all of the MBFGRs that are around the valley, I finally got a chance to go recently as part of a family gathering (which was a planning fiasco and logistical nightmare, but I digress).  This location was, well, lets just say, it wasnt crowded.  And it showed in the service, very nice and attentive.  They were very patient when our party was supposed to be 8 people, then ballooned to 12 people, then 13.  Unfortunately, one of the solutions to accommodate us was to put a couple of square tables attached to our eight person round table.  I *hate* this.  Its just awkward for at least half the people, and then the people that get stuck at the junction...sucks... We ordered some apps, though the only one I tried was the saganaki.  It was definitely good and the pita bread that it came with was nice and warm.  For a meal, I ordered a gyro pita.  Now, I understand that this is a full greek restaurant, and maybe I shouldnt have gone with a gyro, BUT, thats what I was in the mood for, and being a basic greek food, shouldnt be hard to make a good one right?  Well, apparently not.  Ive probably gotten gyros at ten places around town, and this was definitely the worst one Ive had.  The pita wasnt particularly warm and the meat was kind of tough.  The tzatziki was fine, but thought it was a little weird to be on the side. The service was good and patient, but the lame decision to combine two different kind of tables (when we suggested moving and pushing several squares together) knocks them down a little bit.  Though not as much as the not good gyro.  Probably closed to a 2.5, but rounded down to 2."
4,"Dukes is the top place in Scottsdale that my friends and I like to hit up to watch a game, or just grab a drink and bite to eat. The place is huge, the food is priced well for a bar, and theres almost always a decent beer special. In addition to several TVs placed around the bar, theres plenty of pool tables, dart tables, and shuffleboards to keep everyone entertained.  The menu is big for a bar. The odd, also very good, part about that menu is the salad selection. Dukes has two pages of its menu dedicated to salads. While not something youd expect from a sports bar, its nice to know that there still is a healthy selection I can choose from while watching a game. Another cool feature is Dukes ""No DUI Car.""  Itll take you to your next destination.  How can you not like that?!"
5,"I had such a great time at this place both times i went.  The first visit was a sushi dinner extravaganza with my sister.  The place was literally a 10 minute walk from my childhood home, where my parents still live, which was the first bonus for this place.  Once i walked in my excitement grew.  The place was small and intimate although a bit on the hot side.  Our waitress spoke with a heavy japanese accent and she was very friendly.   We ordered a bunch of rolls, they have a fairly small selection of rolls which is fine with me, and some nigiri.  They even had Uni!  i dont know how it is in phoenix but i live in Salt Lake City and Uni is incredibly hard to find there for some unknown reason.  Anyways the sushi was well prepared and tasted very fresh.  Their yellowfin was just amazing! My next visit was a lunch with my mother a few days later and we ate mostly non-sushi offerings which were also very good.  I had yakisoba which was delicious and my mother had the bento box with teriyaki steak which was also fantastic.   This place is a real gem and for me personally the location is perfect."
5,"I indulged big time at Indulge Burgers & More during Fat Tuesday yesterday.  There are a tremendous variety, including many healthy options such as a turkey or veggie burger.  The best part I like is that you can build your own burger with all sorts of yummy toppings.  I had the turkey burger, and the turkey was one of the best I have ever tasted.  Sometimes you can taste like of the darker meats and fatty parts, but I felt like this burger was very clean and lean.  I would highly recommend the sweet potatoe fries that you can order.  You can deep those fries in what tastes like a warm marshamallow dip.   The price is not too bad either for what I call a luxury burger."
5,"Ive been in a handful of times, and last night was also no disappointment. After looking for a place to have a glass of wine late, I ended up here, as 3 or 4 other places in Old Town were either closed (Napoleons and Tapas Papas Fritas both closed at 11 PM??? Well, Napoleons closed forever, so I heard, but wont believe...) or dead. Citizen had a multi-course private affair they were finishing up. Kazimierz had some kind of themed jazz party going and was raucous and demanded a cover charge. But good ol cosmopolitan-cool AZ88 was next on my list, where I had a fantastic Pinot Noir (and Tempranillo), cheese plate (their kitchen stays open till 12:30 every night), and warm and friendly convo with spot-on bartender Steen. Another bartender came in later and was relating his favorite summer drinks in a bon vivant fashion. They do have a killer Moscow Mule which is served in a copper tankard to keep it cool.  Ive been coming in here, on average maybe once or twice a year since around 2007, and let me say at AZ88 the good things dont change. They still have a tantalizing food menu (they are a full boar upscale restaurant), and a drink menu that, together, rival anything else, really, in Lower Scottsdale (and in much of the Valley). Not to mention the atmosphere that for me has the perfect combination of sophistication, decor, music (4 more stars for the DJs mellow-ambient rhythms) service, and vibe that indulges all the senses wonderfully. Im now making this place my default destination for treating myself or a date like VIPs, as theyve shown what it takes to to be among the best at what they do."
5,"I had the best culinary experience of my 8 years in Phoenix tonight. First time at Switch. Started off with some appetizers; pesto & sun dried tomato risotto, marinated chicken breast, Mac n cheese. All delicious!   Next my wife orders the blackened salmon. I looked at her with my wtf scowl. We dont even eat seafood. ""It looks interesting"" she says. Whatever. It gets to the table and its the biggest hunk of salmon Ive seen. We simultaneously stab into it with our forks, take a bite, and we look at each other like the first time we fell in love. The combination of the salmon, bacon and sautéed greens was out of this world. Coupled with the bread pudding and sweet tomato concoction put me over the top.  We let the waitress know what we experienced and to thank the chef. She brought him out and he spoke with us for about 15 minutes. Jason is touched by the hand of God. He proceeded to tell us what he had planned for tomorrows dinner menu and we made reservations on the spot for tomorrow night.  I never knew food could profoundly affect your mood but I was driving home singing my heart out to my iPod. Got home, plugged the iPod into the stereo and continued the concert, danced with my dog and made me a latte.  Perfect night.   Thank you Jason and Switch."
5,"Visited this great place last week with my parents and sister and we all had a great time!  The service was a bit ""in the weeds"" but everyone was friendly and nice and the food was very good.  The tour is worth the $5 and then some, very informative, and our guide was very funny and knew her stuff!  products for sale are lovely and the  drive is worthwhile.  It is a bit way out but it was different and a great way to spend Sunday.  GPS do not like the address so try google maps and your phone/ipad it will get you there."
5,The best food I have found the area and the price is right.  You get so much food you have to take home.  Get there early to get a good seat fills up for lunch.  Priced just right.
3,"So-so Mexican food.  I have heard people raving about this place and I dont really get it.  Dont get me wrong, its better than Manuels or Filibertos... but thats about all I can say. Okay, their Pollo Fundido is good (but not great like you will get at Ajo Als). But lets talk about the purple and teal accent colors that scream ""I was remodeled in the 80s""! Lame. Good chips and salsa but small-ass bowls!  Oh, and dont expect to park in their little lot during dinner rush.  Also, the surrounding neighborhood is definatly the ghetto-side of the Moon Valley area."
4,"I am not a vegan, far far from it. I couldnt be a vegan if I wanted to cause I hate most veggies.  My partner is a vegan however and I am always willing to try anyhting once. The meat-less meat actually has the texture of meat not mush.  I get the original ""G"". It is a buffalo meat-less chicken between two pieces of bread with tomato, lettuce, buffalo sauce, and some mayo like something as well. I get the french fries with this. I actaully crave this damn sandwich now. It is spicy so if you are not a spicy eater I would not suggest to get it. If you like spicy this might be the perfect thing for you. The fries are awesome as well. Shoe sting cut, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Mmmmmm. Just writing this make me want it. I also get the egg-less eagrolls. These are yammy as well."
4,"Ahhh.... Whole Foods, John Mackeys little baby he has turned into a behemoth within the industry. I am so torn by Whole Foods, of course most everything is more expensive. This could stem from when Mackey started the business as a democratic socialist and was not making any money, yet people were complaining about pay and high prices so he then turned into a free market libertarian - you can blame your high prices on that if it makes you feel better. Mackey is also a Vegan, but has said if he didnt sell animal products it would be bad for business(if the business even existed), yeah I get it, but I dont like it. Does anyone even care about the innard workings of the company CEO of the store they love/hate? Ok Ill cut this short. This Whole Foods is an older store, not the real old school hippy-esque store, but its nothing like the newer flagship stores around the country(like the one on Mayo). This obviously means they have to cut back on their selections to a degree but they still do a good job of cramming everything into this much smaller, albeit more ""quaint"" store. If I go to the Mayo store I am gone for 2 hours but only come back with a bagful of stuff because I was lost in a trance ""browsing""; this makes my girlfriend very angry. I dont buy all my groceries here because I dont think some things are worth what they charge but in all honesty you can only find certain things at Whole Foods that you cant find anywhere else(Trader Joes, Sprouts, Sunflower, etc). The Vegan/Vegetarian selection is massive compared to those other stores, they simply carry all the latest and greatest - it may not be the cheapest, but they carry it.  One last item, and this is for pizza loving vegan fools - Whole Foods was one of the first places to carry Daiya cheese. They actually sell shredded containers of it in the refrigerator section, but they also have it available at the deli. The usual counter worker isnt that friendly which is a shame and always seems put out but that doesnt make the pizza any less tasty. You can get one of their ""surfboard"" pizzas which will feed 2 for 2-3 days with a couple of toppings with Daiya cheese for $15.99. This may be the best deal going at Whole Foods and make up for that $8 bar of dark chocolate you just bought."
4,"Ive been meaning to try Humble Pie for a while, and as luck would have it this weekend I was in the right place at the right time and we decided to stop in.  Rumors are true, everything is delicious. We shared the strawberry & gorgonzola salad, which was flavorful, light, and summery. Then we split the Schreiners Sicilian Sausage pizza. It was flavorful, spicy, and delicious. I will definitely be back to Humble Pie when I need a pizza fix."
1,"I should have taken my own advice and stayed far away from this place. Our most recent visit ended hastily when I was served rotten tuna and got barely a ""sorry"" from the staff. I could smell that the fish had gone horribly, horribly off when the ahi tuna salad was put before me by the waiter, and Im shocked that the kitchen actually thought theyd get away with sending it out. The waiter disappeared so quickly from my table that I had to go hunt him down to point out the bad smell at my table was coming from the food, and he took my plate back to the kitchen and five minutes later came back to say, ""okay, we all smelled it and theres definitely something wrong there."" Seriously? You had to go pass it around to confirm that Im not crazy when you can clearly tell within ten seconds that this is not how raw fish should smell? After all this, their solution was to comp an appetizer, not the salad, and eventually gave me a new salad to go, which I decided not to eat just to be on the safe side.  Look, Im not scared to eat week old leftovers or sushi at a divey joint and I dont really get freaked out by the cleanliness of restaurants, but this could have been dangerous.  I have absolutely warned off all my coworkers and friends against this place, and now Im warning all of Yelp. It could have been handled in a way that left me confident that it was just another new restaurant kink, but the awful service made it clear thats not the case and I shudder to think of what new low theyll sink to."
5,"Put it this way: Every guest I have in Phoenix, I force to get the Monte Cristo at Morning Glory. It is just that good."
4,"Wildflower really is a fantastic place and I feel a bit bad giving them only 4 stars.  Let me say up front that this is a place that I go frequently and I love. However, they have some great food and some...not so great food.  If you like soup, try the Potato Cream Cheese.....even my husband, whos definitely not a soup fan, loved it. Its even better when you get it with the sourdough bread....its comfort food, what can I say? Their sandwiches are mostly good. Theres a few duds in there that I cant stand. Im not a huge fan of the vegetarian one, it just tasted off to me and was a bit of a different combination of ingredients. Also, their Brie and Ham Frittata? I ended up searching around in it for the bits of ham and egg...I love brie, I just figured out I dont love it in a frittata.  All in all, it really is a great place to go. My husband lives for the braised beef sandwich when they have it and their desserts are fantastic - you cant go wrong with anything in the magic glass case up front! Plus, the Tempe location is right beside Changing Hands - its like a two for one deal! :-)"
5,"Open Range offers some damn-good home cooking. My family eats here often and has never had a bad meal. Not to mention that the portions are huge.  I usually order the cobb salad. From a typical deli, Id normally expect iceberg lettuce, a handful of shaved carrots, some egg, and a little bit of bacon. But if that were the case, I wouldnt be ordering the salad again and again. The field greens and romaine lettuce are served with avocado (Im pretty sure they use at least 1/2 an avocado for each salad), artichoke hearts, tomatoes, bacon (no bacon bits here!), radishes, blue cheese, egg, cucumbers  and Im sure im forgetting something else, but it is GOOD. Sometimes, if Im really hungry, I order it with a side of their twice baked casserole (twice baked potato in a cup, basically. Its unbelievable.) Id also recommend the Arizona caviar (black bean salad) or southwest coleslaw. My dad loves their BBQ sandwiches (with choice of homemade barbecue sauce - each one better than the last), my mom usually orders one of their other great salads with a side of potato pancakes (better than grandmas), and grandpa loves whatever is on special. Even my picky-eater brother loves food at Open Range - and thats saying something! Bethany and Tom are the owners; Bethany does most of the kitchen cooking and Tom says that hes in charge of most of the barbecuein. (He once gave my family a taste of some of their freshly smoked pecans and WHOA, they were GOOD.) The restaurant (as the name suggests) has a full service deli too, in case you need a pound of freshly sliced ham as well as a meal. In the past, the service has been slow, but it has improved dramatically over the past year. The restaurant has a killer view of the Superstition Mountains, and is within 10 - 20 minutes of countless hiking trails.  To make this long review short: if youre looking for a tastes-like-home (or tastes-better-than-home) cooked meal and youre in the far east valley, make sure to stop in for lunch or dinner. Youll probably see my family and me chowing down too."
5,"The pizza is incredible, they use really high quality ingredients and the prices are great. I would recommend cooking it on the bottom rack of your oven for a slightly better texture on the crust. I want someone to mark that this post is funny, so I will add a joke: Mushroom walks into a bar... Bartender says, ""sorry, we dont serve your type here."" Mushroom says ""why not? Im a fungi (fun guy)."""
1,"marginal sushi meets uncomfotable seating.  we used restaurant.com coupon and got stuck wtih an 18% tip...with no service, seriously???  felt scammed...think we actually spent more based on that tip than had we just paid full price.  avoid this one, just not worth it."
4,"Tanked Fish is one of my favorite places in the neighborhood and we frequent it often.  Rolls are of a great quality and there are some rather unusual and pleasantly different ones there. Price is very reasonable. And drinks selection, if not overly excessive, is ""Cool"".  Place is not riddled with kids, like many other places are, and you can actually kick back and have a conversation there. One one of the weekday evenings they have this special thing where you can request your musical choice from this rather large list. Its real neat. What else is neat - their happy hour on Wednesday (I am not sure what day exactly to be honest. Call them if you really want to know.), when drinks, starters and most rolls are 1/2! This really makes a huge difference.  I gave this place 4 starts. This is pretty much as high as it goes for me for this.  ""I like"" Eugene"
4,"My hard drive crashed on my computer and Apple told me that they recommend a 3rd party company to retrieve my data. Like most Americans I am totally Apple Brainwashed so I did what they said. This company came back and told me that it would cost between $1800 & $2400 to retrieve my data. I asked for them not to precede and got my computer back. I walked into this location, told them my problem and $199 later got all my data put on to my external hard drive. I am very thankful for them and would recommend them to anyone in need!"
4,"Loving this place since I was a kid. Stopped eating meat three years ago, so I miss the Jerk Fried Rice and Carnitas and Emerald Chicken, BUT the Veggie Quesadilla with black beans and white rice is amazing with their tasty red salsa. Always amazing customer service and its great that they let you taste everything before you commit.  They should lighten their footprint and reduce food packaging. I always feel guilty when I leave with all that aluminum and styrofoam. BTW, dont be swayed by offers of other cookies; snickerdoodles are where its at."
3,"When you walk in, its dark and relaxing. The atmosphere is nice, quiet, with alot of dark wood highliting the place. The food is good, but be careful because the price can add up quickly. This will always be a restaurant I go to, with burgers and steaks and spinach dip. The best way to think of this place, is a lower grade of Houstons. Its almost there, but not quite."
5,"Delicious sandwiches!! its so worth the drive i just wish it was closer to home so we could eat there more. My hubby brought me a sandwich home a couple weeks ago and it wasnt the same, it was too soggy so id prefer to eat there. The regular ham with added bacon is the best!!"
3,"with airlines, always hit or miss. delta by far my worst experience on one flight, excellent on the next. american airlines....for our most recent vacation, just run of the mill.  we were boarded quickly and efficiently. in the turks and caicos, our flight was cancelled due to a mechanical issue, but then we got to spend an extra night at the Beaches resort (free food and alcohol anyone). although it did take them 5 hours in the crappy providenciales airport to let us know the flight was cancelled, but 30 minutes later, i was happy as a pig in slop with 2 mixed drinks in my hand and 3rd on the way, with 4 or 5 more to go.  airlines...unless youre in first class, youre nobody."
5,"Wood fired pizzas, scrumptious pasta dishes and bacon wrapped shrimp.  How can you go wrong with a place that wraps things in bacon.  Cmon, even  veggies admit that things wrapped in bacon are good!  Has a smokey atmosphere and a slight bar crowd but the food is outstanding."
3,"This place does not need another review, but Ill chime in anyway. I have been dreaming of coming her for several months after countless hours of drooling over their website. I went for a late lunch with the Gorgeous Gabi.   We had the restaurant all to ourselves, it was quiet and comfortable. I ended up just ordering a salad, it was so hot out (surprise) and I just wanted something light.  I got a Diet Coke and the Caesar Romero Salad (see pics) it consisted of; mixed greens with cilantro dressing, grilled lemon/herb chicken, fontina, cherry tomatoes and toasted pepitas.  It was really good, I like the mixed greens in place of the usual romaine and although I didnt taste much cilantro it had great flavor. Our waitress was not very attentive at all, when she did come around to grab my empty glass of soda she did not ask me if Id like another, instead she brought me a glass of water.........with a bug in it!  Im giving 3 stars for now, but I will go back because there are still quite a few things on the menu Id like to try."
3,"Well....it is what you can expect from airport food.  Not that great but not terrible.  All I wanted was a simple sandwhich to take on the plane with me.  This airport does not have the best in choices, Starbucks, Wendys, Pizza Hut, etc.  This little place is literally a kiosk in terminal C.  It is good if you are in a rush and just want something cold for later."
4,"My best friend and I found this place via yelp after a horrendous experience at Mimis Cafe... so happy we did! Food is great and everyone is so friendly. You can eat out on the patio with shaded tables, or you can eat inside while they play great music (we were dancing to James Brown while ordering our food). Itll be our new breakfast spot from now on!"
4,"We were in Phoenix this past weekend for a wedding and wanted a low key, fun, yummy mexican feast before heading for a night out on the town. Los Sombreros was recommended to us by the concierge at our hotel and it was great!  We sat on the adorable, sparkly light-lit patio and stayed warm with the help of two heaters.  The place was pretty busy but not too loud.  The margaritas were huge and strong as can be and made just the way we liked em!  We shared an order of guacamole - i was slightly disappointed since other yelpers RAVED about it - i thought it was pretty standard, a little better than ""just OK"".  Both of us ordrerd the chilaquiles (he shrimp, me chicken) and they were fantastic although it would have been great  if our server told us that each dish was a legit 10 lbs! We EASILY could have split! we had such a fun time, the service was good, food was good and the patio was a great backdrop for a casual, albeit fairly romantic meal."
5,"This is a fancy fine dining restaurant with a casual feel. The food is definitely under priced. For most of the summer, drinks are cheap and food is half off for the all day happy hour to entice the locals. During the winter, you cant get into this place. It is packed, so reservation is recommend. The food is described as American Southwest. The best three choices to have for the first visit. Is the Famous ""BIG_ASS"" Burger, Green Chile Pork Stew, & Lamb Fondue. These choices will hit the spot and hit the wallet for 10 bucks with tip a person."
3,"Came here last Saturday to see what it was all about but I really wish I had come on Friday instead.. The crowd was a little strange and consisted of mostly older people.. They played a mix of top 40s and hip hop whereas on Friday nights its mainly hip hop.. The drinks run about $7-10 a piece and the bartender that helped me was very friendly! She even offered my friend and I a free shot.. The music wasnt very consistent so there werent too many people on the dancefloor unless it was a hip hop song playing, so I spent most of my time sitting in their outdoor patio.. I love the decor and the ambiance but I really wasnt feelin the scene on Saturday.. Im gonna have to return sometime on a Friday night to see how that goes.."
1,"Went to Fatburger with our family tonight and will not return.  Average food. The burgers were average. The lettuce was wilted, the tomato was green, and nothing outstanding about the flavor. Id say better options nearby are Joes farm grill, In-n-out, or Culvers.  Cleanliness was average. The floor was a little sticky and the beverage area was kept very neat. The kitchen appeared clean.  Service was below average/horrible. The cashier was very unpleasant. We all ordered at the same time and the first half of the food came out about 15 minutes prior to the 2nd part. It was pretty slow. By the time we got the fries they were cold. The staff literally acted like they were a bunch of highschoolers who were annoyed that there were any customers who interrupted their hangout.  I know this sounds harsh...it is. My experience was absolutely horrible. We will not be back and I dont recommend that you should either."
1,"We went here for Mothers Day based on the positive reviews and had a pleasant experience.  Good food, good service, good ambiance.  We came back here for Fathers Day and had a very unpleasant experience; the worst display of management I have ever encountered!  Apparently our order was never put in from the server or there was some sort of ""computer malfunction they claimed, but we waited at the table for 45 minutes after ordering, no food, nothing.  The server obviously recognized the mistake and kept checking in with us and apologized for the unusually long wait, (did I mention the restaurant was half empty, I wonder why!) and she did offer to comp our coffee drinks.  But the infuriating part was when we finally complained to the manager because we could not figure out why the ridiculously long wait, she came over to our table, did not properly introduce herself, sat down and pointed to the man-held computer system and TOLD US we had only been waiting 15 minutes.  Really?!?  Youre coming over to tell us how long we have been waiting???  It was so rude and disrespectful, she was trying to argue her point to us which clearly showed that the server did not put in our order immediately which is probably why the server apologized to us umpteen times!!!  It was the most ridiculous display of what NOT to do as a manager.  I have been in management and customer service for over 12 years and this was clearly a Management 101 mistake.  She never apologized or tried to rectify the situation, but when you come out to your customers in fighting mode you really cannot rectify that!   Needless to say, unless this restaurant starts to provide better training to their managers and team members, or hires a new manager, we will NOT be coming back here again."
5,"Been here a few times, and each time it its the best Thai food I have had in Az. Service has been consistently great. Has a full bar with some good specialty drinks that sometimes take some time to make but are worth the wait. Lots of mid day food and drink specials. Ive tried six dishes here every one has been excellent. Portion sizes are about on par with the average of the many Thai restaurants Ive tried in the east valley, while menu prices are below the average. I think Thai Spices offers a good value for some great food and drink and I cant wait to come back."
5,"This place is as good as Id heard.  We came here for a day-late birthday dinner for my middle daughter/Fathers Day dinner for her husband.  She and his six-year old daughter ordered a Hawaiian style with pineapple and ham, he and I  got the Margherita Pizza with garlic, tomatoes, olive oil, fresh basil, mozzarella, and romano cheese.  Both were so delicious!  He also got some chicken wings which were tender and juicy and not spicy at all, dipped in either of two great sauces, ranch or marinara.  The pizzas were about $13 each for the larges.  I usually have no problem quitting after two slices but the  flavor squishing around in my mouth was so good I couldnt resist taking a third piece at this place.  The decor was pretty and the service was great--the server checked back several times to see if we were doing okay or needed anything.  I would definitely be a regular if I lived near here.   On a side note, next door is the Aloha Kitchen which we had eaten at about a week ago and was also very good! 62010"
2,"Not the WORST place, but nowhere NEAR the best place, Ive ever been. Went in, back in January, for a dinner around 9:30, on a rainy night with my beau. It took 15 minutes for our waitress to stop, acknowledge our existence, and take our drink order. By that time, we had decided our food order, and gave her that, too. Another 10 minutes later, we received our beverages. another 25 minutes later, we received our order, and my chili cheese fries were decidedly bland, while his hamburger was worse than McDonalds. Minus that his regular fries were actually good. Im pretty sure that will be my only experience at SPSs. The decorations were pretty awesome though."
4,"I stayed here with a group of friends for a 1/2 marathon that we were all registered in.  The room that I had faced the In and Out burger but I didnt hear anything.  The pool area is small but if you want a bit of sun I think the best place is in the small grassy area behind the HUGE wicker chair.  Grab a lawnchair or toss a towel down and enjoy.   The biggest complaint I had was that the Bar didnt open until 5 p.m.  Early, I know but it was my weekend! The room itself was modern and clean.  The bathroom was nice, and so were the complimentary magazines."
1,"Called last night @ 4:30 and tried to do call ahead seating for 6:30 for a party of 9. We are in town and are here to see some friends. Explained to hostess that some in the group are seniors so would need to have assurance on reservation. I was told to call back in an hour, the thought process by her was that it was too soon to give me a time and they werent that busy yet. So I did as told and called back and after about 10 minutes of confusion and other waiting I was told we couldnt be seated until 7:30 or we could have seperate booths. I explained that we needed to sit together and 2 hours was the best she could do. I was so frustrated I told her no thanks that we would find other arrangements. She said ok and that was it. Nice job Texas Roadhouse. NOT!!! There is no excuse for not having a reservation system in place, like Open Table. One day there will be no customers to disappoint, then maybe you will get it."
3,"Not quite hot sex on a platter but good food, yummy beer and great music go a long way!"
1,"I used to go here at least 3 times a week for Happy hour.  The volcano chicken was my favorite meal.  However, the last time I was in there I had a cricket in my water.  I took a sip squeezed the lemon, and thought there was something wrong with the taste.  I checked and at first thought it was a lemon seed but no, sure enough it was a cricket (in which i took a picture).  The way this restaurant handled an insect in my water was repulsive.  One of the male bartenders came over and brought a new water saying, ""It happens.""  No, sorry thats disgusting.  If i hadnt been craving the volcano chicken I went there for I would have just left.  And then on top of getting a cricket in my water theres no discount or compensation off of my bill."
2,"Ive been to three Pizza Picazzo locations, and this one absolutely blew,. The reason? Service with a capital S. I invited a very large group out to lunch (made reservations the day before).  The waitress was rude, rude, rude and completely incompetent. When someone asked how large the slices were, she answered regular."" We kept waiting for her to laugh or smile, but she never did. It turned out ""regular"" was her answer to just about everything -- we now use ""regular"" as an inside joke at the office. She also kept us waiting AT LEAST an hour and a half for the check and was largely a mirage during the entire meal. Worst service EVER.  Food was good (though I agree that it could be considered overpriced), but that was completely overshadowed by the horrible service."
4,"On my second week receiving a small mixed box for Natures Garden and LOVE it!  It is more than enough for my fiance and I.  It is the easiest way to get fresh, organic, and local produce, especially since it is delivered right to my door.  It helps learn what is in season and how to make great new recipes!"
5,"Great groceries and fantastic service, keep it up."
4,"Went here because of the reviews on Yelp,  very good.   Had the green papaya salad, great light taste and a very large portion with a few shrimp on top.   Had two types of curries and both of them were very tasty. I need more of that green papaya salad so Ill go back and try a few different things."
4,"Very good, fresh food, nice ambiance, reasonable prices & good service.  Were from out of town & found this place with the help of Yelp!  Wed definitely come back again! We had the Caprese Salad & the Sicily pizza.  Both very good."
3,"This was the first and only Thai place Ive been to in AZ.  Overall, it is pretty good.  I think we will probably try a new place next time but if we cant find anything better, I think we wont have any problem going back to Swaddee. *Price = on the high-end  *Pad Thai = pretty good volume *Green Curry = very good. *Garlic delight = The portion is way too small to charge $11"
3,A timeless classic a place with more shows than I can / care to remember. Seen a lot of up and coming people here as well as some pretty good regular nights as well. Always an interesting collection of different music styles mixed in with a ton of talents of all sorta both local and elsewhere. Cheap drinks and plenty of pool tables. Old school video games and of course darts Pizza and bar food that is actually decent!
5,"Vintage sodas sold by bottle, all of your grandmothers favorite childhood candy, an abundance of gag gifts and novelty items... you just cant dislike this place. Each time Im in, I spend a good hour just perusing the countless Fred & Friends products and debating whether or not I should buy the stick-on-mustaches or 10 of the Chinese finger traps.  But, lets be honest here. I mostly go for the photo booth. By far the best photo booth in town... good quality pictures (not cheap like the ones inside the mall) and they have little masks, glasses, and mustaches-on-a-stick you can use in case youre tired of flashing the peace sign or making that horrendous duck face. Soda. Candy. Toys. Photo booth. Dont kid yourself. Youre never too old for that ish."
5,I`ve had work done by this shop a few times thruoghout the past few years. My latest experience was when my sons car broke its timing belt and needed substantial repairs. Bob informed us that he could move the car out of the way in his lot to be safely stored until we decided whether we wanted to fix it or not. This is just one of the reasons why I`ll always bring my business to him.
5,"Finally a Japanese owned sushi bar beside Sakana in Ahwatukee!  I guess Sushi Ken has been here for a while, but I didnt realize what a great find it was.   My wife and I went there to splurge on Japanese sushi since they are better than the typical Korean owned sushi places which are most common in the Phoenix area.   We found we didnt splurge at all as we do at Sakana or Hiro.  We didnt break $30, which surprised me.  5 stars for value and great sushi! Domo Arigato!"
4,"This place is GREAT! I must have passed it a million times without knowing that it was tucked away in the complex. The sushi was awesome, the drinks were very reasonabally priced, we loved the decor and the atmosphere was very nice, kinda romantic if you are seated in the back away from the sushi bar. The service was great! We will definitely be going back."
4,"This is the old Rigatonys on Brown Rd- If youve never been, it has a Buca di Bepo-ish, before Buca was cool, sort of feel. They even serve their house chianti in a small water glass, instead of a wine goblet- adding to an authentic ""Joisey"" kind of feel. This is traditional Italian-American fare, rich and flavorful- with big portions. The Chicken Piccata is crack-good. Its served in what Ive come to learn is a Sicilian style, with a n awesome relish of tomatoes, capers, and green olives and a side of addictive Fett Alfredo. It never gets old. Another great authentic dish is their Cecca- you can get it as a ""Pie"" (Pizza, that is) or over pasta. You just have try it. Its rich, refreshing, and explosively flavorful all at once. The house salad is a variation on a traditional AntiPasto theme- and is a meal, and event, in and of its self. The best thing about Mardeneleys is that EVERYTHING on the menu is good! It only gets Four stars because it could use a bit more snob appeal (and a better beer selection)."
3,"When Fresh & Easy started popping up everywhere, it was my new favorite go to place for quick and easy meals.  They have a great selection of ready made entrees and salads that beat going through the drive through. The fact that there were always excellent coupons to be received could have been a big factor in why I returned so often. Key word, WERE, I think they have lightened up on their coupon circulation! The problem started when I began to do my actual grocery shopping here.  They have great prices on a limited, but satisfactory, amount of grocery items.  Its the produce and veggies that are troublesome.  I find that they start to go bad after 2 or 3 days, which isnt very convenient or money saving when it means I am throwing half of what I buy away.  I am very conscious of expiration dates on items, and have even found myself throwing away items prior to their expiration.    So, unless your planning on cooking with your fresh items that day, I would avoid the produce and even some dairy and meat items. So what I am saying is, frozen, dry or canned stuff...I am pretty sure your safe with. This location in particular has also been my least favorite to visit as far as friendly staff.  I usually have to bag my own groceries....yeah, I know, self checkout keeps the prices down, however, when you have 2 or 3 staff members just hanging out by the registers with little or no people in line, it wouldnt hurt for someone to jump on bagging groceries...its a little customer service that may save someone from not returning!"
4,"My favorite place for Dim Sum! I have been going to Dim Sum since I was a kid with my Asian mom. I especially like this place because it serves alot of shrimp dishes, and thats what my family loves. I usually go on a sunday. It can be a long wait, but I never had to wait more than 20 minutes for a table. The grounds are fun, there are a few places to see..like the koi pond out back and the bridge and gardens. I have been to San Franciscos china town for dim sum and this beats it! The only thing is, sometimes you have to wait for something you like to come around, and by then it isnt as piping hot. Especially if your seated on the outskirts of the dining area."
4,"I have been a member here for a little less than a year. We go about 2-3x a week & love it! We bought the year pass because it was cheaper that way & we wanted to be more committed than the daily or monthly pass. I have been a member at other gyms but not as impressed as I am with the atmosphere here at Tumbleweed. It has an indoor track to get out of the AZ heat. The gym also offers racquetball which is a fun alternative to workout. They offer an array of classes (Zumba, Yoga, Pilates, Core Conditioning, etc)  which are included in your membership!!!!. You cant find those options for the same rate anywhere else that I know of. The people are professional & friendly - there is no haggling over membership price, commitment, or being approached by personal trainers. On that note, they do not have any personal trainers, which if you are someone who needs motivation or accountability, this probably wouldnt be the place for you. But for the price & option of the daily pass - you could bring a workout buddy anytime!!!  The other side to joining a Rec Center is that you are supporting your city & giving back to the community - not supporting some big money hungry corporation!   Check it out!!!"
3,"I had business downtown this morning, so I stopped in here for lunch, right around the corner.  I used to go to OSF in Newport Beach, CA way back in the 70s, & I was somewhat amazed that they are still around & that theres one in Phoenix! Stepping inside, this is the most junked-up restaurant Ive ever been to!!!  Ok, except maybe Bahooka Ribs & Grog!*  Its a big place, with soft lighting inside, & rooms all over the place stuffed with tons of furniture, barrels, & so on, cluttering up every one of them!  Its all on purpose, of course, & my booth in the midst of all this craziness was actually completely ok.  (The floor elevation is up & down all over the place, too!)  Ok, so for my first time (in about 35 years!) I just ordered the ""Pasta Classics - Rich Meat Sauce"", which is their way of saying, ""Spaghetti."" Some good things: *  I started with a cup of coffee, & it was excellent! *  Pretty soon came a mixed lettuce salad, which was simple, but the Ranch Dressing was really tasty! *  The next thing to hit the table was a little loaf about three by eight inches of hot Sourdough bread, with a cup of whipped garlic butter, all on a breadboard with a suitable knife for cutting it.  It was great!! A couple of less wonderful things: *  Some girl (from the kitchen?) brought my spaghetti before I was finished with my salad. *  I thought the spaghetti sauce was ok, but not great. Bottom line:  They give you plenty to eat here.  My meal included the beverage, salad (or soup), the hot bread, entree, & dessert.  It was nice & filling, & a good value at $9.99 for everything.    :-) *  Rosemead, CA (& formerly also West Covina)."
4,"My husband and I visited the olive mill this morning. We decided to go there after finding reviews on here so Thankyou! It is kind of funny also since we live in Circle Cross Ranch which is just right up the road from QCOM. I have passed this building so many times and just tossed it up to another little local farm out here. First we sampled all the olives and the different oils and dipping sauces. My husband complained he thinks the products are overpriced but I thought they were reasonable since they are really good and dont taste anything like the stuff you get in the supermarkets. After selecting a few items, I bought the mesquite almond stuffed olives and lemon and blood orange olive oils. Blood orange is amazing I cant wait to try it on a salad. I also bought a plain virgin olive oil.The oil is so flavorful and their claim is it is pesticide free since they dont have a problem with some sort of fruit fly they normally have problems with in olives here because of our dry hot climate. We decided to grab a bite. This was the only problem, not for me but for my husband. I guess this is a perfect place for the girls to get together for lunch but if you have a man that has a pretty hearty appetite like mine then he may not quite be satisfied with what he receives.It was perfect for me. I ordered a paninni that had roasted squash, peppers, arugula, fennel garlic aoli and a parmesan balsamic sauce on it. It was very good. Came with a side of kettle style potato chips and some olives. He had a salad but truthfully it was not a very big salad especially with the salads that could serve 3 you mostly see these days. I guess it is true Americans have come to expect quantity.That is ok, I would definitely go back. I will just have to make sure I leave him at home next time and go with one of my gals instead"
1,"I would not recommend this place to anyone.  I went there looking for a gift.  I received no help.  The girl was too busy helping the wives of the baseball players.  I guess you need a large bank account to receive help in this store. Also, they did not have a very good selection of items. I think I will take my business to other stores who care about their customers."
4,"I know little about Ethiopian food. Im an adventurous eater, and was taken here to try it. And I must say, now, that I am a fan!  The food was very cheap, and incredibly flavorful. So, if youre on a budget, and want to either impress a date with your culture, or are a foodie, this is a great place to try! I am writing it only as 4 stars only because I havent tried any other Ethiopian food. However, I pretty much dont want to risk tr.ying another place ;) The Ethiopian tea they serve is fantastic, along with your meal. The portions are generous, along with generous amount of of injera. We has more than enough food around us, and left stuffed. The dish that especially impressed me, was the curry chicken. So much so, that I continually kept enjoying the injera in the sauce.  All the vegetarian food was delicious! I, unfortunately, dont remember the names of everything, but the greens were some of the best Ive ever had, along with a lentil dish.  Also, I rated this good for kids, however, thats only because I have a toddler that eats anything! If you dont have problems feeding your kid unique food, I suggest an attempt! In short, if youre a big food fan, or want to be a little more adventurous on your food options, especially for a great, fair price, try Blue Nile!!"
5,"One of our favorite restaurants in the Valley! We go here about once a month. Some of my favorite dishes are the whole fish, salt and pepper shrimp, Pho with everything in it, Spring rolls, Shrimp/Pork over rice noodles, and the Seafood over soft egg noodles. We also have the Vietnamese coffee as our dessert! YUM!"
4,"On one of my Scottsdale excursions recently i got taken to Delux by a friend who said they make, ""the best burger she has ever had."" So obviously i had to put this to the test.We started with sweet potato fries which were served in a mini shopping cart which was entertaining. They were cooked to crisp perfection and lightly seasoned and still had the incredible sweet potato taste. I got to try the clasic delux burger itself and it was quite amazing, incredibly juicy and cooked just how i like it. We also got the lightly seasoned original fries as well which were just as good as the sweet potato ones. i also got to try the turkey burger which was also juicy and flavorful, along with the chicken panini which was incredibly tasty.  it was a great lunch every one i was with enjoyed themselves and I am glad my friend recommended it."
3,"Love the location and the re-purposed historical house  Stoked that the tortillas are fully warmed like a good tortilla should be.  Crave the creamy, non-lard beans even more than the carne asada.  Diggin the outdoor picnic tables.  Hesitant to order the corn because sometimes it has too much sauce n cheese, which overpower the pure joy of grilled corn.  Not so crazy about my last experience where the cashiers showed more personality talking to each other or the kitchen crew than they did to me while taking my order. Im paying $6 for a burrito, could it hurt to smile and maybe offer me a happy hour beer when Im here picking up my take out dinner?"
2,"On the verge of just giving one star I, I figured on 2 only because I enjoyed the cool open interior of the main restaurant. As far as the food. That is one star.  While having just stopped in at the Ranch Market to pick up a few groceries, I was going to eat at the Market itself but decided to maybe try a place I had never tried near by instead. As I took my groceries to the car, I decided that since I had not yet tried ""Tradiciones"" I would give them a try.  I enjoy the food at the Ranch Market-- tasty and authentic.  Since they are connected I THOUGHT the food would be the same. Boy was I wrong!  I dont know who they have cooking here, but with all the great stuff they have next door it should be A LOT better.  The salsa should have been the first clue...it was just ok.  Again, knowing what they make in house next door, made this salsa pretty sad.  Wanting an Agua Fresca to drink and again knowing next door had like 7+ varieties, I was disappointed they only had horchata and pina here. I got the pina, which was probably the best part of this meal.  I was really craving some tacos, and noticed they only really offered them under the appetizer menu as street tacos. Also wanting to have a sopito, I thought WTH I will get the sampler platter and add a taco.  The platter came with 2 mini chimis, 2 mini taquitos, 2 mini cheese enchiladas and a soptio each of chicken and beef. All looked good when it came out. I enjoyed the taco first...the last thing I was to enjoy on this culinary outing. Then, digging into the chicken enchiladas, the sauce was a ""mole"". This was not a good mole...way too sweet, someones idea of a mole. Yes, just because a mole has chocolate doesnt mean its a chocolate sauce.  And the chicken, stringy bland kinda tough. Everything followed suit, bland not very authentic, someones idea of mexican food. It all reminded me of something I would get if in the Mid-west somewhere and wanted Mexican food...not Arizona!  The only saving grace to this meal was that it was happy hour on a Saturday and the platter was 1/2 off and the taco was a buck so I left paying only $9 instead of $15.  While I will continue to eat at the Market....I will pass on TRADICIONES...*blegh*."
5,"That darn Smokehouse burger is awesome. 5 stars.  The smoked corn was a little Meh... it was oily like not butter oily... not a huge fan of the texture either. I like corn crunchy and it was not.  Service was great.  I did see an unmentionable bug running around near the back entrance towards the chicken rotisserie thing, but bugs have to eat too right? (still 5 stars lol)"
4,"I come here about 4 or 5 times a year. Its consistently good. There is ample seating, so Ive never waited long. Its off Central, so the parking is horrid. Their lot holds a good number, but it can be tricky to get in and out when crowded - I dont drive my van here.   I am always pleased with the food. I find the salads ok - I really like their Balsalmic Vinigarette dressing - Ill mop the leftover with bread.  I typically get spaghetti with meat sauce and sausage. The sauce has a good flavor.  The Brown Butter with Mizithra Cheese is incredible - but very rich.   The staff is always courteous, and I rarely have to wait for anything."
4,"All of the restaurants are excellent:  Houstons, Bandera, Rutherford Grill (Napa), and Los Altos Grill.  Service has been excellent every time.  All the food is excellent, however make sure you get the Tortilla Soup if available.  The ribs, french dip, and hot fudge sundae are great too."
3,my husband and i stayed on a monday night just as a stay-cation and it was busier than i had expected. HUGE bed and very comfy. the AC buzzed  off and on all night and we didnt have the bathrobes that were advertized online. BUT the rooftop deck had a nice view and the breeze was welcomed. we got a drink from the bar and took it up to the roof with us. the pool looked very inviting but there were too many kids splashing around for us to want to venture in. overall it was a good experience and not bad for the discount rate that we found. we were definitely impressed by the huge bed.
4,The Best hash brown casserole ever! My daughter loved the apples and sweet yogurt. The Staff was super friendly. going back this week
4,Friendly and knowledgeable staff! They even have a nutritionist on site which shows their dedication to promote healthy living! I think its great that they make the food daily and have appropriate portion sizes.  I gave it only 4 stars instead of 5 because they didnt have as many vegetarian/vegan meals as I would have liked. What I did purchase though tasted delicious! I look forward to going back and checking out their meals again!
5,"I loved this little slice of heaven.  Reasonable prices, tiny dining room, very personal service.  Pablo was laid back, but with only 4 couples in the small establishment, he did a great job of making sure we were taken care of."
4,Everything I have tried here is great.  Prices are very reasonable. Few things are over $9 and many are about $6.  Love the shrimp fried rice with a very fair amount of medium size shrimp. Appreciate that they deliver and our fast for only a $1 fee.  They have a wide delivery area also so at home or work I can order.   I highly recommend you try their food. They say its New York Style. I just know its darn good!  Every month I order from them a couple of times.
5,I have been here multiple times and each time the staff has been superb.  Their selection is also awesome.  I would highly recommend.
4,"Love this place, been coming for many years and recently stopped by for their italian sub.  Still as good as ever, these guys have great quality produce and a simple but yet complex style in their sandwiches. Little details make me appreciate them, ohh yeah and they have good tea."
5,Free samples? One dollar churros? Cheap buys? Why not.
3,"Ive stayed at an Aloft before.  They are pretty much all the same.  My king room was clean, modern, and well maintained.  I went in the winter, but had it been summer, I probably would have taken advantage of the pool and outdoor lounge area.  Even the gym looked appealing, and thats saying a lot.  The major downfall (and I say major because the whole point of a hotel is to sleep) is that the bed pillows are so incredibly uncomfortable.  It is almost impossible to fall asleep.  Someone please get some decent pillows in there!"
2,"This place is located right on Mill, with a patio that is right in the action. they gimmick of this primarily college bar is their frozen drinks, which are tossed around in Kwik-E-Mart squishy style windows behind the bar that you can see. they come in plenty of flavors like red, green, orange, etc. seriously, they all taste the same to me, and after a couple they only become recognizable by color. the frozen drinks are loaded with sugar and everclear (like the HIgh Octane) so it only takes two to feel super drunk and have a real bad stomach ache (which feels even worse the next day). they also have regular beers and liquor, and even a menu - which i never realized til someone sitting next to me was presented  a hamburger at their table.  overall its not my style, gimmicky, co-edy and obnoxious, and i only end up here when someone else wants to go here for some reason that i can never fathom."
5,Since the Gilbert location has closed. The Tempe location has had more things to offer. The staff has really stepped it up on customer service. They do there best on helping you find whatever it is your looking for.
3,"came out last night with a few friends. The bar was cool, but Im really not a fan of the crowd in Old Town. The drink prices were not bad, but it was a blast dancing outside. Overall a pretty cool spot."
4,"This is the best place if you want to escape Arizona and feel a bit of wine country. Best place to spend a Sunday afternoon. My favorite part is uncorking a bottle of wine, and ordering lunch to be eaten outdoors. So spring weather is the best. Buy a mini loaf of bread and try their delicious olive oils and spreads...super inexpensive appetizer at just $1.50 and the samples are free.  They offer many sandwiches and the waffles with berries are to die for. Looking forward to trying their pizza...on my next visit. Regardless of what you choose follow up with gellatto...yum or take home some olive oil cupcakes. Delicious and moist...but a little spendy"
5,"Last time I went to Zinburger I was wearing a black dress, and the hostess switched out the white napkin with a black one.... real classy."
4,"Lucis is a great little neighborhood store nestled on the corner of 16th St and Bethany Home. They offer a full breakfast/lunch menu (order @ counter, then delivered to table), plus a unique variety of items that you would find in a boutique-esque grocery store. Ive only eaten here once, but I have stopped numerous times for their coffee or a six pack of cold ones. The strawberry waffles were very enjoyable, and the Mrs said the hash browns (mixed with sweet potato hash browns..mmmh!) and the yogurt parfait were also very good.  They have garage style glass doors that are raised during non summer months that allow for a great breeze and view of this busy little intersection. The parking is a bit of a disappointment but I guess you cant win them all. After breakfast or lunch swing by Dicks next door for a drink or wander over to Poor Little Rich Girl for some boutique shopping, great neighborhood spots, wish there were more of them."
5,"Taylors has such a refreshing cafe menu. Ive been for breakfast far more often than lunch. I hope to try dinner soon b/c I think they feature live jazz on Wednesday nights.  Ive never ever had a bad meal. In fact, I always have a hard time deciding. Some highlights in my opinion are the huevos rancheros, eggs Benedict (with a choice of meat), waffles & the Mexican omelet.  I never liked Bloody Marys until I had one at Taylors! I tried a friends once and have been hooked ever since! But if you want a less intoxicating beverage, try the iced chai latte. Careful, its so good youll be ordering another before you know it!  Bon Appetite!"
5,"My absolute favorite coffee shop - Im a regular! Friendly atmosphere & staff, buttery fluffy muffins, ooey gooey danishes, tasty coffee, and support for local businesses and entrepreneurs.  The only negative for me is the mysterious disappearance of the corn tortilla bagel (much yummier than it sounds)!"
5,"When I met some friends for dinner at this restaurant at the end of October, I liked it so much that I made a mental note to write something later.   Ive just signed onto Yelp, and this is my first review. Our group of friends hadnt seen each other for a while.   Busy catching up, we didnt open our menus for quite a while.  I was impressed that our waitress (her name might be Mel) kept coming back in the nicest way to check on us, but didnt interrupt our conversation.   She kept letting us know that she was ready when we were.   When we were finally ready to order, she asked:  ""Separate checks?""   Terrific.  That was exactly what we needed. I hadnt expected to like the food, because I had heard and read that it was all the  high-calorie ""comfort"" variety.   It was a nice surprise that I was able to get low-calorie substitutions for the sides that went with my entree. Overall, it was a very nice experience."
4,"Had a terrific Breakfast Sunday morning with my niece from Los Angles. Great Breakfast Burrito, Outstanding Blueberry Whiskey Cake. Staff was so friendly, Service was great. Will bring all my friends and guest there. Enjoy!"
4,"Surprised by unexpected North Phoenix location.  Attentive but not bothersome service. Antipasto platter shared among 3 people plenty for all.  The Chianti was splendid! The entre arrived piping hot, very impressive.  The food was delicious.  Lovely intimate dining. Reccommend.  Only down side was it became so dim, had a hard time reading menu.  A bit more uplighting, please."
5,"I was at The Rhythm Room and saw these cool people selling Tacos, so I checked it out. It turned out to effen awesome. Fresh quality food!  ChiChi- lisous! Be on the look out for these guys! Chow down baby."
3,"It usually takes a good word of mouth review from a friend for me to try a new Chinese restaurant. However, I was craving this cuisine and this restaurant is close by and tucked away in a small quiet strip mall. Wasnt busy at all on a Friday evening. We were greeted right away as we entered into the clean, open, no frills dining room. We ordered beef and broccoli, chicken fried rice and lo mien. As we waited our super friendly server offered bowls of egg drop soup on the house. The soup was a nice touch but nothing superb. I was satisfied with our meal but it was not the best Ive tasted. Fried rice was a little bland. Beef and broccoli was delicious. Overall Id say the service was way better than the food."
5,"i dont know why i didnt fall in love with pita jungle sooner.  i work right next to the mall so the food court is super convenient for us. let me tell you a story of how i ate here everyday for lunch for a week.  i ordered a standard gyro with no pickles (they put pickles on their gyros and i find that disgusting)  my coworker, jen, ordered the pasta salad with chicken on top.  mine was delicious and i tasted hers. hers was so good! i was like, thats what im ordering tomorrow. the next day we went again and i ordered the chicken pasta. while waiting for the food to come out someone in front of me picked up their order of a hummus trio with chicken on top and a side of pita. the next day jen asked where i wanted to go to lunch. i said pita jungle and i got my hummus trio.  and the trend continued. their food is so good!!!! and its like $8!! and since i work nearby i get a discount!  today i had a side of chicken breast with super fresh mushrooms. i watched them steam them, then put them in a pan with w tons of garlic, red wine, and seasoning. some of the best mushrooms ive ever had and it was a HUGE order of mushrooms. i love this place!"
3,"Ive only ever been here for Transylvania which is their Friday night Gothic Industrial night.  Its acceptable.  I have high standards.  Sometimes the music is really good.  Sometimes it sucks.  They have 2 DJs and I can always tell when the switch from the one whose tastes I enjoy to the one whose tastes I dont.  If youre looking for Death Bunnis, Razor Grrls, Baby Bats or *sigh* Suicide Girls, youll find a few of them here.  There are a lot of regulars and I usually have a good time, unless of course I dont.  The people there have all been fairly nice. The drinks are nothing special.  They arent terrible, they just arent terribly consistent.  If you need to get wasted, get some shots poured. At least that way you know what youre getting. So when you need to strap on your boots, wear your eyeliner, and shake your ass, give it a shot."
4,"Your Mexican grammaw wont necessarily jump up and down screaming ""¡Muy Auténtico!"" but this place still delivers. Standard Mexican fare with pretty decent service. If you check-in on Yelp, you get a 5 dollar off your meal coupon. I really like the hot sauce that comes with the chips and salsa. Spicy and very flavorful. And the Mango Margaritas - nice and stiff. Their entrees are good especially the enchiladas. And I usually get a side of the calabacitas. Theyre open till 11pm on Fridays and Saturdays which is usually when I actually make it over here. A late dinner after some event.  Parking is always good since its a mall."
1,"Total bait and switch sales department! Will tell you one price over the phone, then quote you another when you arrive! Happened to me personally 3 times. I bought from Scottsdale BMW. One quote, one price, done deal. Buyer beware..."
1,"First, I hope La Fonda management reads these reviews and takes steps to improve their restaurant.  Second, we miss the bloody mary bar too.  Hubby & I visited LF a few weeks ago on a Saturday night for dinner. We asked the waitress a general question about a beer and she made something up that was ridiculously wrong.  Okay, she doesnt know beer.  We liked the chips & salsa, it was a good start, then I took a sip of my water.  What the?  I know what Tempe tap water tastes like, but this was weird.  The aftertaste made me cringe, I couldnt drink it, even with a slice of lemon in it, maybe it was the ice.  Hubby ordered chicken enchiladas, which he orders practically everywhere, and it was so bad he didnt finish it.  My meal was not memorable either.  I wanted to love this place, or at least like it.  We walked out of there terribly disappointed, I doubt well go back."
4,"Arizona definitely lack cool spots, but luckily they have The Vig. The venue has a nice patio area--perfect for warmer nights, but the inside tables are fine too.   My friends brought me on a Sunday night where all their bottle wines are 50%off... which is pretty awesome. The service was friendly and the food was legit. Try the ""Good ol Steak Salad"" and Crabmeat Artichoke dip!  btw the valet is $3."
5,"I now consider myself an Arizonian. If you drive a lot on the 101 or 51 like I do, youll get your fair share of chips on your windshield. Youll also have to replace a windshield like I had to do just recently. Apparently, chips and cracking windshields  is common in Arizona. In fact, I seem to recall my insurance agent telling me that insurance companies must provide this coverage in Arizona. I had a chip repaired about a year ago near the very bottom of the windshield. Just recently a small, very fine crack started traveling north on the windshield from the repaired chip (a different vendor repaired the chip). I called these guys over to my house and they said it was too long to fix, so they replaced the whole windshield the next day. What great service, they come out to your residence or place of business to repair or replace your windshield."
2,"Id characterize myself as a Pho Ho (I know that doesnt rhyme) so this rating is going to be lower than what other people may thing simply because my standards for Pho are snobbishly high. A very cute place, the decor and ambiance seems built very much upon the words ""serenity"" and ""harmony"", which is great, but as you might tell with the tone of this post, comes off a little corny. That said, the food here is not too bad.  For lunch, its a decently priced meal for a lot of grub. I got the Shrimp & Pork Spring Rolls and the Pho (which they call Beef Noodles I believe).   My first impression unfortunately when the app came out was that the Spring Rolls used iceberg lettuce instead of basil or mint or a more dark green leafy green.  The iceberg lettuce gave the Spring Rolls a cheaper feel that I didnt really enjoy. The Pho was better though they seemed quite stingy on the accoutrement, as I got two jalapeno slices and a sorry looking stem of basil.  In addition, the thin slices of beef were definitely overcooked and tasted not unlike a sponge.  But the noodles themselves were solid and the broth with a little Sriracha got my blood and tastebuds pumping. I dont know if Ill come back but I would say for lunch, this place is not a bad place to introduce somebody to Vietnamese food."
4,"Always my favorite coffee shop. Too bad the baristas remember my fiancé but not me, even though we always come in together. Pfft. But thats okay. I can take solace in their georgia peach tea and gluten-free/vegan english muffin. Toasted with just the right preserves, it makes my belly happy. I cheated on my diet but thats okay. Just dont tell my doctor. I have always been a fan of their food. I did knock this down to 4 stars because they seem to have dumped a lot of the vegan/gluten-free options they used to have. Super sad face. Also, there was a very loud man in there asking for money, yesterday. But he quickly left. Loud conversation is very distracting. It is not the quietest coffee shop if there are many people, but it is still nice!"
5,"Im not sure why it has taken me so long to actually go inside Go-Kat-Go, but I finally did and loved it!  This store is filled with all sorts of great retro Hawaiian treasures along with a plethora of other gems.  Weve got locally designed clothing in one corner, awesome furniture in another, tons of handmade accessories in the middle and bunches of fun throughout!  It was really hard not to pick up everything in this store and buy it.  The owner was really nice and offered to hold our stuff while we shopped.  I ended up walking out of there with an awesome Dia de los Muertos pillow that looks amazing on my new couch plus a matching potholder/oven mitt set in a really cool pattern.  I will definitely be back, especially since my other moms b-day is coming up and she loves this kind of stuff."
5,"The best fried calamari in Surprise! Delish pizza! Consistent quality and service, never have been disappointed since we moved here in June!"
4,"Anytime I locate a Subway with BOOTHS, I put it on my list to go!  Yeah booths!  Ok, so today after my haircut at (4 Star) Great Clips here in the center, I hopped on in here.   The ""SUButopian"": *  Staff a little drifty.  There was no soup on the menu sign, so I asked Mr. Drifty I, the cashier, what kinds they had today, & the price.  He said, ""We dont have soup here"".  Ok, so I asked him what was in the two kettles three feet behind him.  ""Oh.  I guess we DO have soup, but I dont know what it is, or how much."" Miss Nondrifty appears out of nowhere, & I ask her about it.  She agrees with me that its not on the menu, & says they have Vegetable Soup & Broccoli Cheese Soup.  Fine, but Im a meatie!  (Ok, the Broccoli Cheese is good, but I at least wanted Chicken Noodle which almost all Subways have every day.) After receiving my sandwich (& skipping the soup), I put my cup under the ice dispenser & it was empty!  I gripe & in a few minutes Mr. Drifty III appears & pours a bag of ice into the soda dispenser.  Were at 2 Stars right now, including a boost for the clean, comfortable cafe atmosphere & nice booth to sit in. Ok, the good: Backtracking to just after the no soup/soup/no soup minute, & placing my order...   The place is a little busy, but its not too long a wait for Mr. Drifty II to go to work on my sandwich.  I order a ""Subway Melt"" which comes with ham, turkey, bacon, your choice of cheese, & whatever veggies you want on it.   I get it on their Honey Oat bread, & have him not toast it, but just nuke the four long slices of raw bacon.  The bread gets a thin coating of mustard on one side & mayonnaise on the other.  For cheese, it gets Pepper Jack (of several good choices), then a little lettuce, lots of tomato, some onion, Greek Pepper slices, & a squirt of Ranch Dressing. OMG, it was terrific!!  ...and the October Special is ANY foot long sub  (except 2) for only $5! SO, while this Subway doesnt come up to the 5 Star one down the street at 5130 W. Baseline, the great sandwich & value propelled this one up to 4 Stars (& I didnt need the soup anyway)!     :-))"
4,"Nice car-wash with reasonable prices and decently friendly staff. I can tell the staff is used to dealing with the older gentleman types versus the hip and fun 30-something female SUV driving Mom types, but thats ok. The Mom-mobile was detailed just right, the wait wasnt too long, and the air freshener lasted more than 1/2 a day.  Way way better than Cobblestone Spa over on Bell Rd."
5,The new Kale salad is to die for!  I love this place! Every time we have lunch here it is busy but somehow the staff always finds us a seat! The food is always really good and the speed in which you get it is amazing. This is the best lunch place in the valley!
3,"My son and I were in town and went by Pizzeria Bianco and didnt want to wait 2 hours, so while on the way back to the hotel, my son used Yelp and found this little gem. The pizza was pretty good, and I had a pasta special that was quite good. The owner was very attentive. The nearby table had ordered a large pizza, and they were served a slab that was 1 x 3 on a wooden plank. Very Impressive! The only negative is that the guy cooking the pizzas should let them get a little browner (maybe even a little char) to make the taste more authentic."
4,"Popeyes yes thats right Popeyes, after recently relocating from Chicago to Phoenix I wanted some fried chicken and Popeyes is what I like. Now Fried chicken competition is pretty stiff in the Chi you have Harolds, Uncle Remus, and Mac Arthurs but here in Phoenix I am not so sure of the local spots. There are not many Popeyes locations near my current residences but ahhh.... one is near my work location. Score and this one has the ""Tuesday Special"" 2 pieces - leg and thigh for only .99 cents. Talk about an awesome deal, especially if you like dark meat which I do.  I did the drive thru cause I wanted to get home on the 51 before the traffic got bad and the window person was very nice and efficient. This is now my chicken spot here in AZ unless you know of another one that can get me tasty and spicy chicken I cant be persuade differently."
5,"Man oh Man!   Since leaving New York six and a half years ago I have been in search of good Chinese Food.  I had gotten to the point where I would have even settled for ""decent"".  A work colleague suggested that we dine here on the way to a corporate meeting.  While I realized that he was a native to the Phoenix Metro Area and had probably never even had the real thing, I trusted his palate and restaurant sense.  I was so pleased when we walked in and saw that the diners were predominately Asian.  I knew that  a great  Asian market was next door as well and these things were the first things that signaled to me that I was probably going to get good food.  I was thrilled to see familiar Dim Sum carts rolling through.  We were a party of 7 and shared around.  The food was fantastic!  Dim sum was fresh and succulent.  Our orders from the menu were equally delicious.  The veggies were fresh and brightly colored.  The tastes distinctive and delicious.  The Hot and Sour Soup was perfect filled with all kinds of Chinese mushrooms etc.  I was delighted and reminisced about the many fantastic dinners in Chinatown NY. This food was comparable.  I do not live close by, but I will be a regular there.  Chandler is clear on the other side of the World from me but I figure if Marco Polo could do it, so can I!  Phoenix Palace is the REAL Thing!!!  Friendly prompt service rounded out the experience.  Hooray for Phoenix Palace!"
5,"Great tire shop. I brought in my car because I kept losing air in a tire, they found a nail, removed it and patched the tire in 10 minutes flat. Very nice people, and very fair prices."
3,"Lately, Ive been on the hunt for a good shrimp po boy. Im not sure if this compulsion was spurred by homesickness for New Orleans, the food challenge show featuring 2 famous NOLA po boy joints, or both but Ive it seems the last few weekends Ive found myself dreaming of that crusty bread ""dressed"" with lettuce, tomato, and mayo, and golden deep fried gulf shrimp. I happened to notice Baby Ks one day and decided to try it out. To be honest, I wasnt even really that hungry but I wanted the po boy and I didnt know when or if Id have the opportunity to go back to Town and Country mall any time in the near future. The inside was empty but they have a French Quarter-esque patio complete with wrought iron fence. The bf and I both ordered the half pb with a cup of gumbo. Im a bit of a gumbo snob bc I feel I can make it better than any restaurant can but theirs was really good! They had 3 different kinds which was nice and it was seasoned perfectly. There wasnt a bite that didnt have meat in and the broth was just right. The shrimp on the pb was succulent and almost tasted as if it was battered in beignet mix as the fried was light and airy. I didnt indulge in any libations but they do have Abita and a few other New Orleans beer classics. If I find myself in the area again Id probably go back but this time Im ordering a whole po boy!"
5,"I am in love with this place. Everything is delicious. I have been in a few times now and hands down the best thing there is the asian mushroom soup. The portion size is perfect for lunch. They offer a sampling of 3 soups with bread, which is perfect since I cant ever make up my mind. Last time was in Janet was serving roasted red pepper and sausage frittatas and bacon and egg soup both of which were excellent."
4,"What an incredible little hidden gem!  I have lived here for 10 years and been to Richardsons a number of times, but I never even knew that Dicks Hideaway was around the corner hidden away behind those beautiful bougainvilleas.  The dcor was warm and woody with a very nice rustic feel.   This little place has the all the charm of the guys working inside.  As cozy as it was, I immediately felt like I just walked into that place where everybody knows your name.  My friends and I met for breakfast.  High top wooden rustic table or belly up to the bar?  Very comfortable, either way.  I was expecting the typical two egg breakfast, but to my delightful surprise, they have their own spin on breakfast.  Not sure if any of you had been to Richardsons (same owner AND same owner as Rokerij), but I swear they have the best red sauce on the planet.  I had 2 eggs, over medium, next to some rancho beans topped with a little bit of cheese, and some breakfast potatoes, ALL on top of a fresh flour tortilla.  The best part?  My eggs and beans were topped with their famous red sauce.  OH YEAH.  We were in heaven.  I think we have been there once a week ever since.  Highly recommended!  A +++"
1,"This place has really bad service and the food is barely decent, I would advise not to dine here. There are much better Vietnamese restaurants in Phoenix."
5,"I have eaten here several times before...and I dont think I have ever left upset,  Ive always enjoyed my meals, but this time I can honestly  say that I enjoyed all of my courses!   I was with a group of four other girls.  We all started off with the amuse.  It was some sort of sous vide duck on toast.  It was really good.  Next we had our choice out of four starters...I along with three other girls had the sauteed scallop.  So beautiful!  Four out of five of us ordered the beef tenderloin.  It melted in my mouth...It was perfectly cooked.  The only bad thing is that I wanted more!    Finally, you get to chose from four desserts.  I dont like sweets, so I always bring it home to the kids.  But, they are so beautiful!   Now for the price...my meal was only $13 for everything!  It doesnt get any better than that.  I also ordered the orangecello for an extra $3.  Well worth it! Only sad part is that we were the only table there...Makes me sad!  Everyone is missing out. Our server also took us on a tour of the school afterwards!"
4,"We stayed at the Sheraton downtown and Matts was a short walk.  Definitely worth the walk, and it helped to justify eating such a large breakfast.  There is probably something there that is not very good, but we did not find it.  When you get there, make sure you check in with the person running the register"
4,"Ok, so Ive just come to the conclusion that its not me....... its YOU. I just dont like other peoples used, worn, busted up shit. That said, I really like My Sisters Closet. Ive only been in a couple of times but I know potential when I see it in the form of a $400 Louis Vuitton bag. ( I wouldnt purchase it but I liked that it was there) I did pick up a pair of designer (not sure which one, dont really care) sunglasses for $14. Sure, they are probably *gasp* ""last seasons"" or whatever but I dont care. They look hot and they cover almost my entire face which is something I look for in shades. I will be back soon to see what other goodies I can find. That $400 Louis really made me nervous though. Who has so much dough that they can just drop a perfectly good $1200 bag at consignment??........ and are they interested in adopting or marrying me..."
2,"Personally, I used to come here a lot more often than I do.  Ive noticed, what I feel to be, a rather slide in the quality in the food.  The carne asada burrito I recently got tasted okay, but the meat tasted lesser quality than I was used to.  The guacamole was a bit thinner than i like.  I gave them this score due to them having much better history with me and I hope/think/suspect  they had a weak day.  If they do better or worse next time, Ill post something that will reflect it."
2,The only thing I like about Fez are the pomegranate margaritas.  Food could be better...
4,"Not too much to add. But must try nevertheless.  Second time here, well technically third but the first time it was on a Sunday at 3pm and it was closed. Closed, 3 pm Sunday? That made me a grumpy mumpy, but on the second time/third time when it was open, I was pleased. I mean, Sunday at 3 pm and closed, YIKES!! Where will hipsters look cool and surf on their Mac Books for free or students study for hours while only spending $6?  Went yesterday (third time) for a little of the old in and out, or in some circles known as a spot of coffee. Nice coffee shop, I didnt eat anything but had a lovely triple skinny vanilla latte and picked up a bag of their espresso.  I love coffee art and my skinny vanilla latte had a touching and semi-inspiring flower shape on it. I immediately rushed home and scoured You tube to learn to make coffee art with my espresso machine. Oh, they make it look so easy, we tried it and are beginning to make progress, (I made the shape of an ink blot on my latte) oh to think some day my latte will have intricate bird shapes and strange Aztec images on our homemade espresso drinks, alas inspired by Lolas.  PS. Coffee art is a lot harder than they make it look on You tube.  To sum it up, I found it to be a nice caring touch that you dont see at many other coffee shops.  The shop itself is really set up nicely and in perhaps one of the best central corridor locations possible. Off the light rail and in the heart of Cen Pho, it is strategically perfect.  The down side you ask?  The hours are Wimpy, Wimpy, Wimpy. One would expect later hours with a central-downtown-hip-urbane -Coffee shop of this caliber?  I think the hours are indicative of an inherent conundrum to what ails Central Phoenix as a whole (although improving). Things are just not open late enough to be considered a World Class City. Hopefully, they will have longer hours as time goes on?  Otherwise, I am a fan of Lolas!"
5,"NOCA...  wow. Have you seen the outer limits show where the chef owns a device that when placed in a small room with a single person drives the person completely insane with fear but creates a liquid extract that adds complete and utter bliss to food.  That liquid is then added to  the restaurants soup which is revered as the best soup in the word.  Limit 1 bowl per person...? NOCA must have gotten their hands on this relic.  Honestly.  This has probably been the best dining experience of my life.   Everything was delicious on its own, all together, or when combining just a few of the items on the plate.   Walked in and our server seated us.  They brought us an amuse-bouche that had a small amount of blue cheese, chorizo, and chives.  Was delicious.  Then bread was served. After that, our Bacon and Egg was served.  This was phenomenal.  A crispy perfectly poached egg with oh so tender pork belly....mmmm My fiance ordered the butternut squash cannelloni and I ordered the duck.  Both were amazing.  The duck was so moist and tender but not greasy at all.  We then were served cotton candy as we waiting on our 2 desserts to arrive.  We had the donuts and the de-constructed cheesecake.  I had an espresso and my fiance had the vanilla malted milk shake. All of this was amazing.  My fiance wasnt in the mood for wine, so I delved into the beer list and low and behold, 90 minute IPA from dogfish head.... NOCA, I love you."
4,"There is nothing quite like Persian food;  it is complex, delicious and sometimes like nothing youve ever tasted.   Apart from dads kitchen and sit-down places in Tempe and Scottsdale, there are limited places to find it in the Valley.  Do yourself a favor and dont order a gyro;  you can find one anywhere.  Order one of the daily specials at their crazy cheap prices for Persian food and enjoy!  Ive had nearly all of them and they rock!  These dishes take all day to make; believe me I know and you can taste why.  And do not miss the saffron ice cream with rose water and pistachios."
5,"When was the last time that you went to a restaurant and were still bragging about your experience two weeks later??? This is exactly what I am doing about the ""Arrogant Butcher."" I went there a couple of weeks ago with a bunch of folks from work. We had a private dining area and our servers name was Mark. He truly made the experience AMAZING!  His detailed, vivid descriptions of the entrees and desserts were comical and had most of us in tears. You could almost smell and taste each item as he passionately went into detail.  The appetizer- soft pretsels with cheese..OH EM GEE!!!!!!!!  Why doesnt every restaurant have these??? The crab stuffed chicken......AMAZING! We shared several desserts, one which was a peanut butter cup......stand back Reeses......you have competition now!! =) The manager came in later and had a professional, yet funny, manner about him as well.  What a great team they are."
5,Angel sweet is without a doubt the best gelato Ive had outside of Italy.
3,"I can say that I used to love the place. Not so much any longer.  Went over there this past Sunday at 7pm. Crowded, but still room to sit 6 of us. Here are a few simple notes to sum up the evening. Waitress was on something. She was walking, but out of it. Forgot our order twice, and both times could not remember even taking them. Very bizarre.  Girl next table fell over and out of her chair. No one really even seemed to notice, maybe that happens often here now.  Place looks tired, worn out, especially the fabric on the chairs and booths outside. If you squint, you can see the old Vig, when it seemed spotless, and shiny. Now a bit tattered, along with the staff.  If you are over 28, then I would have to say you might feel old in here. Reminds me of a spring break crowd being filmed by an MTV crew in Cabo. Very young, very drunk."
5,Island Terrayki is a great place to eat at.  The owners are nice the prices are right you cant go wrong with that.  My coworkers and I have been going there for a few years now and we all love it.  Highly suggest eating here if you are in the northwest valley and want some good quality food.
4,"Jamba is definitely as good as it gets when it comes to chain smoothie places. We are big fans of the Acai antioxidant smoothie, which is unlike the other smoothies that weve tried there. It is super healthy and has a distinct flavor to it which we like because its not as sweet as their traditional smoothies are. I like going to Jamba because they are always reliable, fast and friendly when we have visited, even if the smoothies are a tad pricey. But, you get what you pay for, and I would much rather pay a little extra for a consistently good smoothie that I know will be delicious than take my chances on an unknown place that most likely wont deliver the goods."
5,"Yes, it is small, yes, it takes time to get your order, but the quality of the food serve is excelent !!! Celina is the name of the owner (not Selena) of this fabulus resturant.  She takes your order, runs to the kitchen and then she serves your order too. I wouldnt say that this is a one person resturant, because she has help in the kitchen.   Very few Mexican resturants in Phoenix serve food as good as this one. The Menu is limited but whatever you order you will not be disappointed."
4,"Disclaimer, I was raised in New Orleans, and miss good Poor Boys, Crawfish, Boiled shrimp, Jambalaya  etc.... yadda yadda yadda, hear me whine...  I try to be lenient when I go somplace because its unreasonable to expect to find the food here that I would at the Magazine St. Po Boy shop.  I was also raised on popeyes, every once in awhile I would hop off the Streetcar on the way to school and get a Chicken Biscuit w/cheese.  And frequrntly I would get a 4 piece spicy, and even though it was a chain, it was a local chain with massive quality control.  (and yes, odds are those years are most likely why over the past 3 years Ive lost 250 pounds!.... Moderation kids!) Over the years, the chain was sold off, the original owner died, and Popeyes became more hit and miss, especially the further you got away from the south. Heck, you get your hopes up just to see a Popeyes! usually the stand alones are better, and the ones attached to Gas stations are hideous.    Ive tried a few in the Phoenix area, And have been generally unimpressed. Not horrible, but just... a very thin flavorless crust. So it was with trepedation that I went into this location, a drive through, attatched to a gas station. I went for a box of chichen w/biscuits. and I can say it was the best Ive had in the city so far. The man at the window was friendly, the chicken was fresh, good, solid breading. With enough heat to give a nice depth of flavor, cutting a bit deeper than other chains would dare... which is what Popyes is all about. (Im used to some blazing hot chicken... not stupid mind you, just HOT.. this is not that, but a good flavor. With good moist flesh, and thick crunchy skin. And the meal made the travel home well. One downside? Im just not a fan of these biscuits, they werent old... but they were dry... and lack the lush, buttery flavor and texture that I love. These were more dense and hockypuckish than I prefer. If your craving some Popeyes chicken... well, lets put it this way,,, Ill be driving 20 minutes out of my way to go here. This is my first time... so Your Milage May Vary..   Sidenote, In no Churchs Chicken fan, but I went to the one on Arizona Avenue... and Ive got to say, thats some fine spicy chicken! And cheap! And a big box of fried okra makes The Bride very pleased indeed!"
4,"Accidently discovered this place because of the Chinese New Year/Vietnamese Tet Festival of this year.. very nice surprise that the buns here are bigger and have more filling than the buns at Lee Lees Market. I know, I know, there are probably many more places in AZ that sells these, but I honestly dont know of any other places that sell these other than Mekong Plaza (here) and Lee Lees in Chandler.  Its around $1.30-1.40 a bun and they seem very fresh because the times that Ive came by, someone is preparing and cooking them in large ovens in the back. Very nice that it is located by the Asian market and shops. They have a frequent buyer card you can pick up in the front (for every $100 you spend, you get $10 off your next bakery purchase). This is gonna be in use for me since I can see myself coming back countless times!! P.S. Please change your outdoor business sign to ""AA Wholesome Bakery"". Since it says ""Mekong Bakery"" on the outside, it confuses people."
1,"If you want a school that cares more about your financial aid money than you, this is the school for you. Education is horrible. If you are a democrat, dont speak your mind; you will be considered a reject from day one. I got 100% on my graduate papers and think I did not contribute anything to the fields. This institution is a joke."
4,"I had a nice lunch here on a hot summer day. $12 for a good pastrami sandwich with crispy seasoned fries and an iced tea. Definitely recommend the food. Line was very short on a Friday afternoon. Soda machine ran out of ice, but they filled my cup with ice from ice maker in back and quickly filled machine with more ice."
3,"Sam is da man. I was very impressed with the fare here. I had a bowl with noodles and chicken on my first outing, and it was awesome. Another time I came I felt way hungry, so I ordered the SUMO bowl. Whoa. The bowl is a 32 oz bowl, I could have had it all chicken though. The beef is meh. I agree with another yelper that the eggrolls are subpar. They are grilled I guess? I dunno, lame. At another location they had these ""carnival"" cookies that were awesome. Another variety of cookies were the butterscotch. OMG. Amazin. So yes... Sam is da man."
5,"I liked this place. The reviews show low stars but I liked it. I was there for happy hour so go at that time. The pricing is good. I dont know about dinner, but happy hour is cool.  Servers were chill.  Host was a bit stuck up. Not sure why she though she was that great. But the place is cool. I recommend people check it out if they want to try a sushi place on the Mill ave when you are in town visiting Tempe."
5,"I found the food excellent, but keep in mind this isnt typically Mexican food this is Tex-Mex which is a whole different variety.  Our waitress was fantastic, and talked me into getting the melted cheese on the side. It was quite tasty, indeed it has a bit of skin but generally if you cook cheese or milk included products into a liquid quickly it does get one..and personally I didnt havent issue about it.  The menu isnt extensive, it would be nice to have a bigger menu but with how accommodating the are, you could probably something off the wall and theyd be willing to do it. I ordered the bean and cheese burrito, which is delicious, and large.  Its a fatty, and I loved it.  When asked if they cook with lard the hostess had an immediate answer and listed what they used to cook everything with. I was so happy. Most have no idea, and arent very polite if you ask. She was very friendly like everyone else we encountered there. I was told that the Steak was perfect, and mr.hard-to-please was filled up (had left overs) and stayed that way the rest of the night. Which was great. The salsa has an interesting flavor, and I must I dig it. I""m not a big fan of mexican rice so I didnt partake in eating it, however the fan of mexican rice at the table liked it, (but not as much as the fajitas)  Conclusion - Excellent Staff, Great Food (Its Tex-Mex..not just Mex so bare that in mind. There is a difference!) Atmosphere reminds me of some place that would be placed in a Tarantino film. Price is average sit down if not a little high. Expect 2 people = over 30 dollars."
3,Pretty nice sports bar. A lot of nice tvs. Food is typical sports bar food with a few exceptional choices. Would stop by again if I was in the area.
4,I liked this place...its a little dark.  I went in the middle of the day so there was probably more workers there than movie goers.  And the staff looked pretty bored actually. 3 bucks aint bad for a movie.  I thought the place was clean and a decent selection of movies and refreshments.  I come from a small town so even this theatre is an upgrade for me. For three dollars I will most definately be hitting this place more often.
1,"Yikes...I wont be going back.  The ordering system is confusing. The staff also seemed confused. The food was very bland and pretty tasteless.  THIS PLACE IS NOT EVEN IN THE SAME LEAGUE AS HONEY BEARS NEAR THE AIRPORT!! Skip this bland chain, and go to Honey Bears!"
5,"First time here, new favorite. You can create your own antipasti plate, and the pretzels and fondue are AMAZING. Also the ricotta gnocchi is the best I have ever had. Service was good, Liz was our waitress and she was very friendly and helpful. Monkey bread is also stellar. I cannot wait to go back."
4,Very friendly but need to work on the bathroom
2,"Our group was not pleased with the quality of  the seared tuna salad (everything about it was low quality and just not tasty) and the quality of the grilled cheese (Velveeta cheese?) sliders.  The cuban sandwich was pretty good, though its not enough to make us want to go back for more.  On the good side, our server was really nice and sitting outside was very pleasant and breezy.  I hope the food improves."
4,"Yum, Jersey Mikes! I freakin love their wheat bread with the little specks of... I dont know what it is but its very good. The mini sandwich looks tiny when you first see only the bread but after its decked out and rolled up, it becomes a plentiful sized sandwich. Ive tried different sandwiches here... turkey, club (both kinds), italian and cheesesteak and love them all. Theres something about that oil and vinegar they top it off with in the end that seals the deal. Other places do that too, but Idk here it just tastes better. Sometimes I ask for the chipotle mayo instead of the regular and its quite yummy with a little added spice.  Also, I like that they carry Pepsi products. I like it better than Coke. And they have Cherry Pepsi, too  :)"
4,"Yummy, creative sandwiches!  Good prices.  Highly recommended. Service is generally a bit of an issue, so if you are one of the prissy eaters who doesnt understand that serving can be tough, youll probably get your panties in a wad."
4,This place is great. It is very clean and the staff is very nice and accommodating. Every time I walk out I am completely satisfied with the work.
1,"I wish I could review the cold food stand attached to this restaurant separately because I want to tell any and all persons who think to stop by for quick sandwich to stay far, far, away from the tuna.  I thought nothing was worse than slowly starving on my flight back home, but I found it in the form of this cold, barely-recognizable-as-food sandwich. I think Id prefer eating tuna out of the can over this."
5,"Oh AJs...  How do I love thee...  Let me count the ways (BEERS)... 1...2...3...200! They have so many different beers to choose from here.  If you ever need an ingredient that is out of the norm they will have it.  If you ever need an ingredient for a special dinner that MUST be fresh and ripe, this is the place. From 10 differnt types of flower, 15 different brands of pasta, to 20 different types of EVOO, if youre making a really great dinner, spend the extra couple of bucks and get your stuff here. One day Ill be able to afford the prime steaks."
5,"FnB is how every restaurant should be. Unfortunately this will not happen because Pavle Milic, who runs the place, cannot be at every restaurant.  This is a small, friendly restaurant in my hood, that just happens to have some of the best food you will find. I always feel welcomed & taken care of by the staff. Ive come here with friends, but Ive also come alone & felt totally welcome. I like sitting up at the counter, and Ive actually met some really great people to chat with there. Pavle & his wife run the place, & they are the kind of people who always make you feel like they are glad you are there. Chef Charlene does things with food that make it amazing, & these are things that I myself could never accomplish. My main cooking skills involve a microwave or a menu. I just wish I had the funds to eat here more often. In conclusion, fabulous food combined with wonderful service make me feel lucky to have FnB in my neighborhood. :)"
1,"I will never know what the food tastes like because they were so so rude, I will not go back.  We came in and were given a table, menus were practically thrown at us.  And then we waited, and waited and waited.  We asked a woman working there, and she apparently did not speak English and indicated a man at the front would help us.  But he was too busy talking.  We got up and left.  No one even said a word when we left."
2,"Are you stalking me?  Heres a hint: Im not at Myst.  Ever. The crowd is too young (think ASUs entire Greek scene), too wasted (think puke-your-face-off drunk) and too retarded (think OHMYGOD we SO just got into a club and were only NINTEEN!!).   I freaking hate this clucterfuck.   House music is not my thing, watching underage girls snort coke in the bathroom is not my thing, and fighting through people who are under the false impression that they are cooler than me is not my thing.   They have world-renowned DJs in there every once in a while and a pretty decent chance of celebrity sightings which brings Myst to a whopping 2 stars."
1,Most livable city my eye! Plastic yuppies around every corner looking for a reason to belong.  I cant wait for the homosexuals to take control of this dog park and give it some class. Avoid at all cost.
4,"Theres a lot to love about this quick but hearty Mex Grill.  I love walking in seeing that the guys standing in the open kitchen are roasting peppers and chopping tomatoes for their salsa bar.  A lost art most would say in a place that seems like could be your typical chain, quick fix, ""Fresh Mexican Food""...   The two owners are buddies as the name proclaims and they are a friendly bunch.  The food though is why this place is a small gem in  the NW Valley.  The Burritoes are huge and would challenge Chipotles size, but also put to shame the cold taste you get from Chipotles burritoes, from ingredients sitting out cold like a Subway line...   The Burrito Especial is really good which has big pieces of shrimp and some nice chunks of zucchini.  The steak served in their burritoes is also very impressive, nice grilled taste and definately not chewy.   The sides are generous when you get a combo and the salsa is nice and fragrant.   Overall this is a great place to eat, period.  The three flat screens hung up high always have football games on, on weekends.  Awesome food  that cooked right next to dining area has never seemed to dissapoint us."
2,"The caramel ones were heaven on earth, but I agree with the other Yelpers that the standard brownie is on the dry side. I still have quite a few flavors to sample, but from what I have seen so far, they are not worth the price point."
5,Good service and good food! I ordered the burger sliders for lunch without the 1000 island dressing and loved them! A quick little meal for those on the go! The attendant even offered me a nice tall glass of ice water to go while I was waiting.
5,"My brother from San Francisco was in town and missing the sushi from the bay area. I decided Id let him choose where wed go out even though Id never ever heard of this place before. It was definitely in a not-so-glamorous area, tucked on the side of a dinky shopping center (sorry shopping center). When we walked in I was pleasantly surprised by the quaint atmosphere and set-up. Its definitely small but everyone working there and eating there seemed to be genuinely having a great time.  We sat at the bar/long table in front of the sushi chefs which was a fun experience. We started off with sake, and it was pretty darn smooth. We ordered a variety of different dishes including sea urchin eggs, yellowtail shashimi and the king crab roll. They were even accomodating to make my brother dishes that werent on the menu. The chefs are so nice and fun and the prices are pretty good! My brother was extremely impressed coming from a top sushi city. I look forward to coming back and trying more of their extensive menu, especially for happy hour."
4,"For those who gave this place low marks, forgive me. I really like this place. Now I havent tried various dim sum places so Im reserving the right to downgrade the place as needed. The variety of food is plentiful, and the carts just keep on coming. I love the steamed pork buns, and the shiu mai (not sure if I spelled that correctly). Yesterday, my favorite pick was the deep fried rolls of taro and shrimp. YUM! I have never ordered from their menu so I can only talk about their dim sum. My friends and I try to go eat dim sum almost every Sunday. Its a cheap way to try new foods, and if you dont like it, well.. you can get away with pushing it aside with minimal guilt. Give it a try! You might be surprised."
2,"uuuuuugh. What a sorry disappointment of a meal. The BF and I went here for dinner tonight and it was pretty not good. I got the pick two with the balsamic steak panini and the chicken stew. The BF got a turkey panini. Well....his panini was barely toasted, let alone a panini. My sandwich was toasted but the steak was pretty gross....chewy and tasted like it came out of a bag. The tomatoes were mealy. The whole thing was sad. The chicken stew was decent, but had that plastic -y look to it. I always find that a little disturbing. It came with a biscuit that was really gross and didnt go with the stew at all. Both of our cookies were raw in the middle. Plus the meal cost 20$. Really?! 20$?!?! Are they kidding me? I could get a countless amount of better food for that money. Not awesome. Not even good. I wont be returning."
4,"So much better that 5 Dorks, I mean guys.  They have salads and great chicken selections!"
5,Love this store!  Were really helpful when I helped plan a replica white house dinner for DESERT SHADOWS MIDDLE SCHOOL for 370 7th graders.  Gave me a discount on the party supplies I purchased for the event.  Even called others stores to find me the extra stuff they didnt have.  Love their halloween section too.  Its my one stop shop for parties!
5,I love that they are kid friendly and that chef Aaron came by to ask how everything was. Delicious food.
4,"La Bocca was on my radar since it opened earlier this year... I cannot believe how long it took me to finally get there, but it was worth the wait.  I went with a group of four on a Monday night.  (1/2 Price Bottles of Wine from 5pm - close on Mondays; needless to say, we took advantage of that special!) We let my friend Anthony do the ordering since hed been many times before and he also has a vested interest of sorts... We started with two salads: the prosciutto, zucchini, and artichoke (my favorite) and the goat cheese and pear... also quite tasty.  You cant go wrong with either one.  We then had the truffled harvest mushroom and the spiced pepperoni pizzas.  Yum!  The thin crust and the combination of fresh ingredients on both of them were perfect!   Along the way, owner Julian Wright sat down with us to share some wine and conversation - hes fantastic!  While he was completely engaged in talking to our group, I could tell he was also constantly surveying the restaurant to make sure all was running smoothly.  Every patron that walked in the door received immediate attention including our group.  Our waitress was sweet and I liked that she gave some attitude back to Jared when he was joking around with her. We had a blast on top of a great meal and ended up staying for hours enjoying  two bottles of wine (maybe more than that as I lost track) during that time.  One of them was a La Crema Pinot Noir, but I think we had a merlot as well and maybe another Italian Red.  I guess Ill have to go back and take notes next time.  Another reason to return will be to try the brusschetta - it sounds amazing.   I have a feeling it wont take me as long to return to La Bocca as it took for me to get there in the first place.  You cant go wrong at La Bocca if youre looking for pizza, salad, wine, and all in a warm, welcoming atmosphere.  Check out their other daily pecials too - I know I will!"
3,"Hmm...this place has a good lunch happy hour, but the choices in the menu are kindof limited.  The food isnt bad, but its not amazing.  So, three stars for being average i guess? I do come back every so often so I guess its a plus."
5,"The food really is exceptional. Its like the chefs create these perfect little bites, and they literally are bites, of food that are so interesting to taste. Id recommend the sampler dinner. I want to say it runs about $40- $50 but its worth it as long as you like whats included. IT IS EXPEN$IVE. BUT the BF and I have been dying to try out this restaurant due to all the rave reviews it has been receiving on Yelp. LUCKILY a Groupon appeared for NOCA and we jumped on the opportunity. Turned out the fab deal was only marginally helpful. Even with the Groupon it was still a $150 dinner (plus the cost of the groupon...).  Granted we did get a bottle wine (but the cheapest we could find), espresso and a french press cafe... Its like you analyze how much everything costs as youre ordering and are still shocked when the bill comes- I hate that. Our reservation wasnt until 8:30pm at night, no big deal. The restaurant was still PACKED! AND people kept coming through the door! It is not a large venue. And the tables are CRAMMED, uber close together. I know that the four-some sitting next to us are going to Isreal next month, right after their family vacation to Minnesota...."
5,DELICIOUS sandwich prepared fast and just the way I wanted it!  Ill be back for sure!  Welcome to the neighborhood.
5,"I came here for the first time ever on Mothers Day. They were packed ,the line was out the door and down the path. Still they managed to get everyone seated and quickly attended to. We were a party of 10  our server was so great and i am sorry to say i do not remember her name. She had all 10 drinks refilled continuously. Brought us lemons and cleared the table with amazing speed, as well as taking care of a completely full restaurant packed with Children that were running under foot.   The only down part was that they had plastic dishes but, with all those people what are your choices. I loved the food. I had shrimp and fish and vegetables.  Nothing fried.       The best part for me was the Chocolate fondu!!  Although there were many different choices. You could never say that you did not like what they were serving.  have seen a million adverts for this place and i am happy that i finally got to go."
4,"I enjoy their Rama Chicken. Their peanut sauce is great. However, their service is slow. It is difficult to eat lunch their because it takes so long. If they improved their service my rating  would be 5 stars."
5,"Saigon Pho doesnt have a fancy sign, great decor or even windows you can look in/out of. But who cares when you have the most amazing Pho in the valley (and at the best prices)? The servings are very big and everything averages about $6 a plate. Staff is very attentive and quick to deliver the goods. As you can read through the various other reviews - everyone has a favorite dish. I have a problem with gluttony so I cant suggest a single dish - I can only suggest them all. However, this place also has some of the best Salt and Pepper calamari Ive ever had."
5,I love vegetarian restaurants! I support them 200%. So glad this place exists in Phoenix. The quality of the food is beyond excellent. The meals are creative and super tasty. Never disappointed. The only qualm I have is the service. It...is...slow. Whether its the time it takes for my meal to reach my table or the cashier taking my order to ring it up correctly. The length of time it takes should not be so long. Prices are a bit steep but most vegetarian/vegan restaurants are priced a bit higher than others. I dont mind paying more for quality. Overall this place is a favorite weekend visit. I cant wait for my next meal at Pomegranate Cafe.
4,Efficient friendly service and good fresh-squeezed juice. I rarely eat breakfast food but I enjoyed their New Mexico skillet.
5,good place to kill an evening. I used to spend my time here many moons ago. good coffee at good prices.
5,"Im fairly new to the whole Costco experience. Now that weve bought a house its time to buckle down and buy in bulk! As as new user Id thought it would be helpful to post the following neat services Costco has to offer: 1. Great deals on contact lenses. Before I would buy my contacts from justlenses.com but through Costco I bought 8 boxes (a years supply) and received $50 off! $25 off via instant rebate at the cashier and another $25 off via mail-in rebate which came in less than a month after the order. 2. PIZZA AND HOT DOGS. The take out pizza is huge and only 9.99 and the hot dog and coke pair is only 1.50. These make for a delicious and quick lunch. They also have smoothies and salads if youre looking for something on the ""lighter"" side. 3. Food expos come and go often. Recently I got a deal on a 10 pack of pita bread, a huge container of hummus and pita chips for 12 bucks. The company was from California and let customers try as many samples as they pleased.  It was well worth the money and super fresh! 4. And heres where I feel Costco has really benefited me. My fiance and I booked our honeymoon to Tahiti through Costo Travel! Im big on comparing prices before making a big purchase and Costco was hands down the best price. It included seven nights, hotel and round-trip airfare all for one great deal. The customer service agent I spoke with was friendly and more than willing to answer my 500 questions about travel. I would recommend Costco Travel to anybody looking for reliable customer service and excellent travel/airfare packages."
3,"The actual bar (especially the outdoor area) is really pleasant in the cooler months.  That being said its also near the university so can be overcrowded with snotty hipsters at times.  A good place to socialize with reasonable prices, and oysters, yum."
4,"My daughter has been attending Gold Medal Swim School since February.   The instructors are great!  They always take the time to say hello outside of class and they are very caring.   The class ratio is fantastic - with a max of 3:1 in each beginner (Starfish) class.   Currently the price is $72/month, which includes 1 class per week during the Spring and Summer and the ability to schedule unlimited classes per week from October-February.  The school also routinely sends emails for a free class when there is same day availability (usually with newer instructors). The only reason I am leaving this at 4 stars is that my daughter has struggled with swim lessons in the indoor pool because some of the sky lights are not covered/filtered.  She is very sensitive to light and I am concerned she may not be able to progress with the way the skylights are currently.  Only time will tell!    The management at Gold Medal is top notch, which is probably why they retain such happy employees! Overall, I am very pleased with Gold Medal.  And, yes, the owners were Gold Medal Olympians!"
4,"Went here tonight with a friend and we had a wonderful experience! We decided to start with the calamari which was just ok but I am more partial to the fried versions so that could have been part of the problem it was a little on the rubbery side and wasnt packed full of flavor. The bread that came with it though was absolutely amazing, hands down one of the best breads I have ever had. It also had a mini salad with it that had a wonderful dressing so we focused more on the bread and salad as opposed to the calamari. For dinner I decided to go with the lamb and potatoes which was 3.5/5 stars. It had decent flavor but I definitely have had better. The potatoes were very delicious though :) My friend had the duck and potatoes and it wasnt gamey and fell right off the bone which was great. It had good flavor but once again I have had better. For desert I got the pear/almond pastry(tart? cant remember) and it was absolutely amazing!! Soooo delicious and had a great balance of sweetness and was the perfect size. My friend got the blueberry and lavender desert with red cake and white chocolate which was very good as well and you could taste the lavender which was delicious but overall I dont think I would have been able to eat the entire thing myself as the sweetness level was very high. This was a very cute restaurant and the staff was wonderful and very helpful. We had a great experience here and are looking forward to returning! I definitely recommend people try this!"
2,"Where do I begin?  Lets start with the server who literally yelled everything he asked or said to us. Oh, and then he rammed a chair into my leg and was just not very concerned about our experience overall. Lets move on to the cheese crisp, which had plenty of grease cascading off the pieces, and virtually no ""crisp."" Did you put some cheese on a tortilla and microwave it? Cause I could have done that at home. Both drinks were quite tasty- my tea was strong like I like it, but not bitter. Hubbys lemonade was very good, but he drank it so fast I didnt get a chance to steal many sips. Lets discuss the entrees, shall we? Hubbys carne adovada chimi was decent, better than my carnitas. In fact, MY carnitas is better. (I keep aiming for Chef Hectors at Sams...) Yes, the pork was very tender, but the salt was -shall I put it nicely?- aggressive. Sam Kinneson aggressive. The ""tortilla"" was an inedible science experiment. Thick and doughy, and made even more appetizing by the charred side, it reminded me of the salt play dough we all made as kids, formed into a pancake. Truly nasty. As for the legendary salsas, Hubby found the green to be tasty, but he did not care for the flavor of the red. Neither was especially fiery to him either.  Riding on reputation, are we?"
4,"Yeah, its a chain and while not haute cuisine, we had a very good meal there.  We were there on a busy Saturday night and we had great, friendly and quick service and our food was quite good.   Not only is it a good value for the neighborhood, I thought it was downright cheap for what you get.  (Its probably roughly comparable to The Hillstone Groups Houstons or Bandera in terms of quality and service at about half the price.)   Great salads too. I wouldnt necessarily go out of my way for it, but its a very reasonable choice if you happen to be at Fashion Square. Dinner for 2 with drinks, about fifty bucks."
4,"Delicious kosher food in Scottsdale?  Vegetarian? Awesome! We go to this restaurant regularly.  The food is always great.  The service, as many other yelpers have mentioned, can be excruciatingly slow some times.  I will say that in the last month or so, they have hired some more waiters and those boys are hustlin.  Its an improvement, but I agree with others who have said this might not be a good choice if you are short on time. I like the Ginger Soy Beef, Veggie Hot Pot, Kung Pao Chicken and so on and so on.  The food is very good, but not super spicy how I like it.  I would recommend this spot for the great food and the improvements in service."
5,This review if for their happy hour because thats all that Ive experienced.  Love that they have happy hour all night on Sundays and Mondays.  I live close by and used to frequent Wildfish often for happy hour.  I usually get the crab cake and lobster bisque.
3,"If it was possible I would give 3.5 stars.  I rounded down because the first time I ordered from here they screwed up my sandwich (I ordered a cheese hero and they gave me a ham and cheese hero - ham-stink is permanent and since I detest ham, it was a whole sandwich killer). Meatball hero was pretty good though I would not rush back to get another.  When I finally did get a cheese hero, it was delicious - this I would rush back to get.  Husband loves the Bobby. The service is a little slow so Im going to try ordering through their website the next time.  Capriottis has definitely earned a spot in my sandwich place rotation."
4,"Great quality. Their Pad Thai with chicken is the best Ive ever had. Fresh, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. Their Yuphas Fried Rice is delicious with the pineapple compliments. Their Red Curry gets a 2 star rating for just being Red Curry (its not as creamy, fresh, or flavorful as Thai Basil on University). Its a neighborhood gem and Im lucky enough to live right around the corner from Yuphas Thai Kitchen! Also, its clean, bright, and has an inviting ambiance. Its perfect for a sit in casual dining experience, and even nice for takeout.  Staff is friendly and attentive.  Come here. Seriously."
5,"Im a sucker for a yummy coconut cupcake and Tammie Coe has the best around as far as Ive tasted, and Ive eaten a lot of bad coconut cupcakes -- all in the name of research of course.  Keep em coming, Tammie!"
2,"I like spicy. I mean I like to sweat from the bridge of my nose when I eat. When they asked how hot I wanted my green curry chicken, I did a double take. ""Isnt green curry spicy by definition?"" They told me they make it in varying degrees of spiciness for the ASU crowd. While I disagree with diluting the authenticity of the traditional preparation, I get it - they have a business to run. What I really dont like is how they do it. They make a mild green curry...er, no, green sauce. Then, upon ordering, they add a certain amount of red chili flakes depending on how spicy you want it. This is not only upsetting philosophically, but chili flakes need time to cook in a curry - you dont just drop in, stir and serve. I get the sense that this problem is rampant in Arizona; hope to find a solution soon."
4,"Ive heard way good stuff about this place for a while and finally had the pleasure of sitting down and having some lunch there. Thoughts: Staff was friendly and quick, nice place, very clean and some hi-tops and lots of tables and outdoor seating as well. Chicken salad bagel sandwich wasnt too bad at all, except for the nuts in it - Id probably eat it again however.  Had a tomato basil bagel toasted with it... yum!  Im wanting to go back to try different menu items now :)"
5,"I see Jenny Strebe who cuts and Veronica Peebles who colors. They are AMAZING! I am so glad they opened Salon Stylush, it is the perfect size (not too huge and crazy) and it is so modern & cute!  Jenny is an amazing hair stylist with the accolades to prove it (she styles hair for fashion shows, magazines, television, etc). Jenny has been cutting my hair for years and she is super sweet and super talented. I trust her with my hair, no question, and recommend her highly. Also, she has a talent for mens hair as well. She cuts my husbands hair and that is one of his best qualities (Id say!). There are so many men out there with bad hair - Jenny knows how to make it work for men! Veronica has colored my hair for years - and she is hands down one of the best in the industry. I never loved my color until I found Veronica. Now, I trust her completely and know shell make my hair look great, and natural, which is important to me. Shes also super sweet! I highly recommend Veronica as a stylist and colorist."
2,"I had never been to Dominicks and I like trying new restaurants so I was excited to check it out.  We had a reservation for 8 pm on Saturday night and when we showed up the restaurant was busy.  It definitely is catering to those that want to be seen and show off what they have.  As we were walking up they had 6-7 of your finest vehicles backed in right next to the front door. Calling it a front door is a little misleading however.  I found it interesting for such a nice restaurant to have a revolving door as there entrance.  Once inside the door you are greeted by what is a darkened ""Liberace"" type decor.  Think big chandeliers and crushed velvet.  We were seated promptly for our 8 pm reservation. Top line the food was mediocre.  We between the 4 of us we ordered the  Scallops, Halibut, and the Ribeye as our entrees.  For our sides we ordered the potatoes, gnocchi, and creamed corn as our sides.  The main issue that we all had with the food was that it was very salty.  At one point my buddy across the table asked me "" does yours taste really salty?"". I answered yes and everybody else chimed in that theirs was quite salty as well.  I dont know if the chef was having a bad night but if not he needs to pump the brakes on his salt usage! Finally this place isnt the cheapest place.  I am not one to complain about prices and I eat at fine dining restaurants on a weekly basis as part of my job.  Our bill for the 4 of us was $500.  We did have a couple drinks a piece but the price we paid did not match the quality of food we received. My advice is to check out the bar for a few drinks and enjoy the people watching.  Think Phoenix Open.  Otherwise if you are looking for a good steakhouse head across the street to Ocean Club."
5,"Cant go wrong with an iced gingerbread latte, hot waffle with Nutella spread and free wi-fi - especially shared with my beautiful wife. :)"
4,"I go there once a month or so with friends.  Yeh, people watching is the best.  I like to dance too, and I dont care if people think Im horrible.  Im usually laughing and having fun.  And thats the point, right?   When you get tired of one room, go to the other.  Its fun."
4,"This little place is great, the service, the tacos, the guac, and the prices!"
3,"I met a friend for lunch yesterday.  Loved the water feature and patio walking in, if it had been warmer I would have definitely sat outside.  Inside was a little dark and I guess it was all the bats around but it reminded me of ""Dusk Till Dawn"".  We were seated, I hope was hoping for chips and salsa, I guess they dont serve them here?  We werent even offered the ones on the menu, which I probably would have declined anyway because chips and salsa should be complimentary.  Anyhow I ordered the Fresh Snapper Tacos (see pics)  There is a lot of fish there being smothered by all those peppers, but as for everything else what you see is what you get. For $15 I would have liked more than a TBSP of each, rice and beans, and a DEFINITELY more than a teaspoon of cheese and sour cream and maybe a lime or lemon.  There was more garnish on the plate than anything. Other than that it was good.  My Friend ordered the Green Chile Stew and The Green Chile Mac and Cheese (see pics) She has been here before so knew what she liked. I tasted the macaroni and thought it was pretty good too. Ill give 3 stars until I go back and try out some other things."
3,"Monday Morning - take out Room for improvement -  - same curt, terse service - too cramped to actually look around and appreciate their items for sale - food was average, but not worth all the fuss this place requires. + I like the food for the most part and you cant go too wrong with a red velvet cupcake...can you? This place is all fuss and hippity dippity so i surmise that is the situation with the crowds.    I am sure I will be dragged there again by another friend in that neigborhood so I will try to look with new eyes. :)"
2,"I am one of those people that talk crap about Gordon Biersch behind its back but Im nice to its face. I go there and continue having expensive yet mediocre meals, but like I just said- I go there. My boyfriend asked me once ""why do it to yourself when you dont enjoy it? "" I dont know. Maybe Im a masochistic eater. Actually, Im just very agreeable and I work super closeby. AND if I didnt go there I would just walk over to Whole foods and spend a zillion dollars on a goulash-y takeout container that I dont even like after I pay for it. For me, lunch is more about getting out and doing something else for an hour a day. If someone wants to go to GB I will happily tag along and probably eat, even though I know I wont like it. At least theres not much harm in that, except to my wallett! PS- Lori is the nicest, sweetest server/bartender ever and chatting with her makes up for the crappy food!"
5,"Unique selection of antiques, linen and assorted pictures and estate jewlery along with new timeless designs. Located in downtown Gilbert worth the trip!"
4,"It finally opened! The sign has been on the building for at least 3 seasons, maybe more, but the wait was worth it. We needed a breakfast spot in this central area sorely. The order system is like Pei Wei, line up and order at the counter get a number and sit down. Bad news, the wait was long, the good news, the food is great. I guess, I revealed that Im impatient and want instant gratification. Thank God that they gave me a cup for coffee after we ordered and got our number to pin on the table on those ""Alligator Clips"". Every time I use those things, I flash back to the early 70s using those clips for that last toke that then gave the super munchies. Coffee, $2.50 a cup for a bottomless cup with plenty of choices and in a to go cup. Atmosphere.....very hip look, open ceilings, nice patio, great colors and great sayings on the wall to remind us of cool sayings to remember while we nosh. Breakfast came pretty quickly considering how many people were in the restaurant . I had a breakfast burrito that was plump and was plenty of food. I just hoped for more....maybe those alligator clips reminded me of the munchies of the 70s. Sandra had a cinnamon roll and although I thought it could have been bigger....she enjoyed and said ""It was fine and filling"". Saw several friends there, all overweight and they said the portions were very satisfying.  This is stupid but I love it. The Dyson hand dryers in the bathroom. They are the best. Ill be back for more and they can earn that fifth star Im sure."
5,"I just got back from my first visit ti Jacks All In Social Club. Ill be go back. I found the place a nice place to play a hand or two of Texas Holdem poker. The owners are nice couple want to provide a nice, clean, and safe place to play poker. They have succeed."
4,"AY. DIOS. MIO. The Platano Paleta is a day-maker. Theres caramel, creamy, frozen chunks of banana, and añejo rum all swirled together on one wooden stick. At least five different people asked me what I was eating and where they could get it as I walked down Mill Avenue, vainly trying not to make eye contact with anyone while eating a popsicle. If youre looking for something new and interesting (and sexy, as popsicles go), eating one of these would be more effective in drowning ones sorrows than a pint of ice cream. For the more timid, or perhaps just fans of classic flavors, the Fresa con Crema actually smells and tastes of a fresh, organic strawberry upon first bite, until the flavor of rich cream overwhelms the taste buds to create a perfect harmony of awesome and more awesome. Anyone whos partial to artificial strawberry flavor over that of a real strawberry should a) avoid this paleta and b) reprogram your mouth and possibly reevaluate your life.  Pure fruit lovers, even you cannot escape the appeal of Paletas Betty. The Pura Piña is almost just a frozen pineapple on a stick, but much more exciting. Its a sweet, delectable confection filled with pineapple pieces and a consistency thats closer to creamy than it is to icy, even though this ones totally vegan. It also contains some sort of hallucinogen that will make you think youre in Jamaica for a short period of time. Go. Eat. Prosper. Youll probably see me there with a paleta in each hand."
5,"I have played this course two times now.  From the moment you pull up, you feel like you are at a private course.  The staff is very friendly and professional.  The views are breathtaking and both times I have played, the course has been in impecable shape!   The course is challenging, but still enjoyable.  Lots of holes that are down hill (great for long tee shots!).  This is one of my favorite courses in the area!"
3,"This place was good, just not as good as I had hoped based on the reviews.  I would have given the place 3 1/2.  Since I cant, I decided to balance out another reviewer who gave the place 4 stars but also thought it deserved 3 1/2. Positive notes:  Hot sauce had some bite to it, chips were good, Camarones culichi had a wonderful sauce.  Lots of fresh limes served with the meal.  Full bar. Not-so-positive notes:  Shrimp in the Camarones culichi was overcooked (cardinal sin for a seafood place).  The shrimp coctail was just ok - good sized boiled shrimp, but not too much flavor.   If driving by and hungry I would stop in again, but not if I have to drive too far out of the way."
5,"Delightful experience! I came in with my 2 little ones alone. Jay was our waiter, and a very good one. He got the chefs to prepare their sunsine roll with orange and passionfruit dressing, because I am highly allergic to mango. He was very accomodating. I also had the seared tuna tataki, which was also excellent. My kids had miso soup and their fried rice; both were very good. I was very surprised that a strip mall sushi joint would be thay delicious. Thumbs up!!"
2,"My regular nail place was closed today so I took a chance with this place.  I called ahead and was told it would cost $25 for a gel manicure..Great!  They were busy and I was asked to wait a bit...no problem!  The lady that greeted me took a look at my nails, which was a dark red gel manicure, and told me she would start me in a soak.  She asked what color did I want and I replied that I wanted white tips. 30 minutes later the lady that signed in after me was called first then 10 minutes later I was called and told to soak my nails in soapy water bath.  I sat and soaked for 20 minutes while the workers worked on people that walked in with ""quicky"" needs.  Finally, the lady that greeted me came over and said I should have been soaking in acetone and not water...she apologized and started the acetone soak.  30 minutes later, and after I scraped off most of the old polish myself, a man started my manicure and my greeter finished it so the man could start a ladys pedicure who had been soaking her feet for 30 minutes and visibly pissed.  When she was done with me she told me that the next time I come in I need to tell them that I have old gel polish on so I can be started with the correct soak.  Really? I was relieved to finally get out of there and all ready to pay my $25 for the services.  I was told it would be $25 for the gel manicure AND $5 for the white tips!  Wow!  Really?  I know it was only $5 extra but after spending the whole afternoon there with bad customer service the extra 5 bucks seemed outrageous. Ill wait for my regular nail place in the future!"
5,"After weeks of anticipation, Side Bar has finally opened.  As you ascend the staircase to the second level, the reason for the long wait becomes apparent.  The attention to detail is amazing.  Once layered with crumbling plaster, the walls were meticulously stripped to reveal the historic brickwork.  Other historic elements include the original steel casement windows that feature a view of downtown phoenix and the surrounding area. Tastefully integrated with these elements is a contemporary interior design.  The lighting consists of warm colors that set the stage for the laid back atmosphere.  No expense was spared when designing the bar and tables, which are made of dark exotic woods.  Seating included organically shaped bar stools that adjust to a comfortable height and depth.  There are also several u-shaped sofas that create conversational areas.  Behind the bar youll see an array of artistically arranged circular openings backlit in a warm, yellow tone.  Thick glass shelving lines the back wall along with a fine assortment of liquors.  The ""soft opening"" menu included wines and locally brewed beers among others.  I tried a White Russian and my wife had a glass of Chardonnay.  Both were very good.  Prices seemed to be close to average for the area and when compared to the experience, were a good value.  I had a chance to speak to one of the owners who was glowing with excitement.  After two years of remodeling and working with the city and adjacent historic neighborhood, his vision has become reality.  In addition to a brief history of his endeavor, the owner informed me that additional overflow parking will be available adjacent to the main parking lot.  Parking was one concern originally voiced by the neighborhood and city.  The owners may also experiment with weekly art showings by local artists.  Maybe they can arrange for it to coincide with First Fridays.  Within walking distance of Side Bar, dining includes Pei Wei, My Florist, and Zoes Kitchen.    If youre looking for a unique hangout in an urban setting, then Side Bar comes highly recommended."
4,"Good tattoo shop. Clean space, multiple artists to choose from and books of their work are available for you to look though and decide whos style most mirrors what youre looking for. I chose Jet to do a cover-up for me and he worked with me on the design and our ideas and communication flowed very well. Hes a very personable guy, is friendly and keeps the conversation going while hes working on you, and he doesnt dick around (read: He starts to work and continues until the job is done). Hes very professional and informative. Good customer service combines with talent at the craft."
4,"Ok, Im new to the whole Thai food thing, and Im a wuss when it comes to spicy food, so take this review for what it is.... I was told by plenty of uber-Thai food fans that this place was the bees knees, but I wasnt too impressed. i kept it pretty standard ordering just pad thai noodles with tofu and iced tea. the iced tea was killer (i find that at most thai places, what is it with the iced thai tea phenomenon??) the flavor was pretty bland, i have to say. it was the right amount of spicy, but just still bland, no bueno. plus, for a thai place, they did not cook the tofu well, it was totally bland, too. i was disappointed, but i will probably go one more time because you never know if you just catch a restaurant on an off day. it was super busy on a tuesday lunch hour, too, but we got in and out pretty quickly, so its good for a work lunch. ***update 1/08 Im glad I made that disclaimer in my original review, because Ive been back three times (only for p/u) and its now one of my top thai places. Maybe I was bitter because my editor took me there for my year review to tell me the paper couldnt afford more than 3 percent raise (on a reporters salary, thats about 35 cents - you can imagine my bitterness). Hahahaha. Im still not 100 percent a fan of their tofu, but the other entrees Ive tried are not as bland as my OG visit. Its a great spot to pick up even if I just walk in and order because, what I assume is the owner (a middle-aged Asian women who dresses professional), is SOOO nice and helpful* with the menu and there is a small bar (really small, like 4-5 seats) where I can order a draft and hang out for the 10-15 minutes it takes to make my order. *definition of ""soooo nice and helpful"": She answered all our questions regarding level of spiciness and confusion over which entrees included noodles or rice patiently and with a smile; suggested one of the most delicious fried banana/ice cream desserts Ive ever had; and, one time she realized we werent finished with our beers when our tightly packaged food was place on the bar, so she spent five minutes undoing the tie to poke holes in the to-go boxes so the steam could escape and not make our food ""sweaty"". RIGHT ON! that definitely earned them an extra star for service! so... more like 3 and half *************************** im bumping up another half star because their stellar customer service is dead-ion consistent every single time i come here. i highly recommend the Yuphas House fried rice with tofu - flavorful and not too greasy. and big points for being able to order every single item on the menu as spicy as you want it."
5,"My Fiance and I went here today for the first time. We shared a meat pie and a serving of the largest  Bosnian Sausage dish.       ALL of it was amazing. I cannot speak highly enough of their food. Service was very prompt and the waitress courteous and quick. The food was very reasonably priced and the restaurant itself was very charming and nicely decorated. All over, the ambiance was pleasant. I look forward to returning!"
3,"If you have to travel to Phoenix (Yay!) then chances are you have to travel through Sky Harbor (Boo!). Theres also a decent chance youll consider traveling on Southwest (Boo!) but as airlines (Boo!) in Sky Harbor (Boo!) go, you can do worse than Southwest. Im not a huge fan of Southwest, although Ill give credit where credit is due, and that bags fly free thing is genius. Combine one of my least favorite carriers with what is probably my least favorite airport and youve got a recipe for disaster, but somehow it works out in Southwests benefit. The gates are just as hard to reach for SWest as other carriers, and youre not banished to the edge of the universe for check-in or for baggage claim. Theyve got a decent presence here, so you may actually find a human who can help should you have a problem. Yes, they may leave you stranded on the runway for a while in 100 degree plus weather (check) or force you to dash across the airport with late arriving flights (check) but every once in a while its a painless operation."
2,"This might be a good way to kill time if youre near the airport, the food really wasnt that great. It tasted cheap and like it had been sitting there for a very long time. I had the caldo 7 mares and it was lukewarm, wayyy too salty, and the shrimp were mushy. It was pretty gross. The carne asada tacos were mostly gristle, and I couldnt really taste my enchilidas with the thick blanket of sour cream over them. For $20, I couldve gotten much better Mexican food somewhere else."
4,"Since Im big into breakfast foods, Im always on the look out for a new place.. and whadda ya know. .I found ""The Place""  How convieeeeent..  I read the reviews and when asking a few people on Facebook about it, I heard nothing good good responses, so why not give it a shot.  I heard that you have to be early or it gets insane.  We showed up about 9AM and waited for maybe 5min.  Not too bad.  The menu looked incredible and as I watched the servers take food to the tables, I could see that the amounts of food give were enormous.  I couldnt wait.  Checking the reviews on Yelp, I ordered a chorizo omelet with avocado, and all the fixens.  I thought Id love it, but I think I was more overwhelmed with spice than anything. and I love spicy food.. what gives?   The second time we all went, we got there at 8AM and sat right away.. this time I was told to order biscuits and gravy..  Damn were they good.  I got an order of those along with a huge pancake.   Heres what I loved about their pancakes.. they tasted home cooked.  Like when your mom takes out the old griddle that still has last weeks charred food on it,  yet still cooks on it, and it has that home yummy taste? Yep.. thats their pancakes.   Downed that with some iced tea and it was one awesome breakfast.   Ive been here three times now in two months... I think Im hooked."
5,"This was the first real ballet I have ever been to, and I was so excited it was the Nutcracker! I have been wanting to see the Nutcracker for years.  Thanks to Lindsey and Yelp, I had the opportunity to go and the performance was just stunning. When I walked in, I noticed the lobby was beautifully decorated, a gentleman reading a story to children and a ballet dancer posing for pictures. The bartenders we bought our drinks from, was very friendly and accomodating.  I cant say enough about how beautiful the performance was from the dancers, the sets, the costumes, etc. Just incredible. I may just take my daughter to see it with me this season...."
5,"As far as gourmet burger joints go, this place is the bomb! I am a huge fan of Deluxe Burger and now they have a run for their money! Plus the parking is much easier at Zinburger. I had the Zinburger, and we shared sweet potato fries and regular fries. Everything was delicious! All 3 of had the Zinburger, so not much variety at our table, but we all finished our burgers, and given the size of them, I was pretty surprised/impressed with all of us. The burger was heavenly, juicy and cooked perfectly. I would definitely go back, again and again!"
5,"Lately I have been addicted to a good Caprese style sandwich and Pane Biancos is AWESOME!  I read the previous reviews so I went there expecting a crowd and nowhere to sit.  This did not detract from the experience for me because the quality and freshness of the food was more than enough to get and keep my attention.  The staff were very friendly and helpful, being from the Atlantic Northeast I have high expectations when it comes to Italian done well with personality to boot. I did not want to wait till I got home to eat my so good smelling prize so I went outside to find picnic style tables and benches.  It was way to hot to sit outside and I was craving iced coffee so I went next door to Lux and was both surprised and relieved to find many of their patrons with Pane Bianco bags openly eating their lunches with drinks from Lux to claim patronage.  Cant wait for a hopefully air-conditioned expansion."
4,"One of my favorite aspects of this Central Phoenix wine bar is that it is still somewhat ""undiscovered,"" aka not teeming with hipsters and young professionals on a Thursday evening after work. It stays busy, but not jam packed.  Their Happy Hour is great, nice $5 small plate options, and you must try their cherry lemon drop martini. Seriously delicious. Get a ride from someone, because youll probably want another :)  The decor is cool and they play French movies on a large screen in the back of the restaurant. I also have a special place in my heart for their awesome sweet potato fries! This place is a great option if you want a nice glass of wine and a bite to eat in Central Phoenix but dont want to brave the Postino crowds."
4,"Being the pho addict that I am,Im always on the lookout for a new place to satisfy the craving.This place was called Tu Do for a long time.It was a place that never seemed crowded,with an older Vietnamese lady as the only cook.The place was run down and the service indifferent ( I know these traits are not uncommon in Vietnamese restaurants).Then it was called The Ritz for a while,with a remodeled interior but with the same lady doing the cooking.Now,the restaurant has new ownership,a local Vietnamese family,and its a whole new ball game.   I ordered my usual pho tai bo vien with goi coun (spring rolls) as an appetizer.Id give the soup a thumbs up.The broth was well balanced, a bit on the oily side (thats not a bad thing for me),not the strongest nor the weakest in town.The basil was fresh,the meat was of good quality and quantity.They didnt skimp on the noodles.On the down side,they use those meatballs that have a more rubbery texture than most,and they only give you 3 of them (4 is the norm).Overall it was a good bowl of pho,but its not going to unseat Maxim or Khai Hoan as my favorites in metro Phoenix.The spring rolls were above average,with no shortage of shrimp,and peanut sauce that tastes like peanuts,not hosin.   The service is much more attentive now,and these folks seem eager to please.Also worth mention is that Phuong Dong is inexpensive.Not quite Pho Thanh and Da Vang cheap,but pretty close.Another good thing is that they are open very late on friday  and saturday, 1:00am! Late night pho fix! They also serve beer.  I like this place,Im looking forward to trying the Canh Chua Tom.I hope they succeed."
5,"Sam, Sven, and all the vendors here make the market special."
5,"Delish!!!!!! x 100!! Love, love, love this place. This is the place that made me a Vietnamese fan for sure. My friend brought me here and I was blown away but the tastiness of their food. Their spring rolls are so yummy! The chicken noodle soup flavor is a winner in my book! Everything on the menu is delicious, though I havent tried is all, Im sure it is!"
4,"Fun place for happy hour. Good prices, good food and great staff."
4,"Hadnt been before but my fiance has been going for ages.  I had the coconut shrimp, very good and moderately priced.  Very friendly service.  Itll definitely be a place I consider in the future, especially if Im using the light rail in the central Phoenix area."
4,"If your boyfriend is a baseball player and is in Spring training.... Watch out for the heat...as it gets SOOO HOOOOOT and SOOOO DRY...... i literally had to stand with my legs apart and my hands on my waist to air what needs to be aired. Yup. Support thy boyfriend..... I cant wait to come back here this May for Minor League Spring training! I probably will be wearing a bikini and a see through dress.  But really..Ive never seen fields so well managed here... Ive only been to where the Royals practice....and Its quite amazing! This May, id definitely see games at the Texas side."
5,I had lunch here today with co workers and it was absolutely delicious! Cannot wait to go back gain.
5,Great iced tea. Terrific Roast Beef and mashed potatoes. Love the biscuits. You cant go wrong at Cracker Barrel.
1,"Disclaimer: I am a Thai person and a Thai food connoisseur.  This is supremely average Thai food and overpriced as heck to take advantage of White People. Sorry to be blunt but thats all it is. $18 dishes that are $8 at a real Thai restaurant. The spring rolls were very bland and came with only a tiny bit of sauce for dipping. They should also include on the table a selection of fish sauces and spices to add to your meals and appetizers. They dont have. If you like spicy, skip it for sure. Again this is what we would call Tourist Thai back in Thailand.  Tiny servings. The good. Friendly wait staff. If authentic Thai is what youre looking for try any of these: Palees Crown, Tum Nak Thai or Royal Thai Grill."
4,"How much is good pizza worth? Is it worth being subjugated by a tyrranical owner slinging expensive pizza?  Maybe, but only if its really good, which the pizza at Joes happens to be. Decisions, decisions.  It smacks of the soup nazi in its unfortunate contradiction. If the pizza werent so delicious, this would be a quick and decisively negative review. Sadly, for me the reviewer, for me the consumer, it isnt that easy. My suggestion is to go during the day, before Joe is embittered by partiers and the lunch special is readily available."
5,"Ive eatin a lot of pizza and can say without worries that Mama Mias is the Best Ive had -- Consistency, value and great service sets them apart -- They also have the best take out wings in town!!!!"
4,"Tasty, large portion, culinary delight appetizers. More of a bar than a restaurant, but the food was good & trending artisanal."
4,"Ive traveled to Phoenix several times for business trips and stayed at the Ritz. True Foods was my go to spot in Phoenix because it was right across the street from the hotel. I love this restaurant for the casual vibe and healthy food. My favorite dishes are the Edamame Dumplings and the Miso Glazed Black Cod. It was often hard to get out of work for lunch, so coming to True Foods at the end of the day was always a treat.  I only wish they had one in San Francisco!"
1,"I am furious. In the last 12 months, I have had at least scheduling issues, from them calling me at 8AM on a Saturday morning (my 1 day off) to cancel my 11am appointment to last Saturday, when I went in only to be told someone had messed up, and actually booked me for the NEXT week, and despite me driving all the way out there at 11am, they couldnt get me in until maybe that evening, and then not with someone who had experience in deep tissue/medical massage. I was irritate and ready to ask for my membership refunded then, but Ashley the clinic manager promised me that theyd give me my next week appointment free of charge, and that shed personally be certain there were no more issues.  As I literally couldnt turn my head to the left due to pain, I took her up on that. BIG MISTAKE. Yesterday (the Friday before my ""correctly"" scheduled massage, I went out of my way to call in and confirm my own bloody appointment, to try and avoid last weeks debacle. According to the woman who answered the phone, it looked like my schedule therapist was actually scheduled off, but she went to talk with her manager, and came back to the phone telling me everything was ok, and that shed call with any issues. Then yesterday evening, I got ANOTHER confirmation call from Massage Envy, confirming and reminding me of my 11:30am appt on Saturday with my preferred therapist. GIven that Ive had 3 migraines this week (versus my 0 or 1 when I get a massage the weekend prior), I really absolutely needed to get in, so I felt more confident. Well, I was just woken up at 8am...again. On my day off...again. To explain to me that, big shock, they messed up my scheduling again, and that apparently, my therapist was off today. Despite Ashleys promise of it not happening again. Despite me being pro-active and calling to confirm. I am sitting here in pain, so furious at this repeated treatment that I cant even go back to bed...and the best part? They dont even have a manager on duty I can complain to. My treatment at the hands of the booking/front desk staff has been any thing BUT relaxing. I continue to walk out of there frustrated, angry, and occasionally in tears. I know they say Fool Me Once, Shame On You, Fool Me Twice, Shame On Me, but I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. Im pretty screwed for today and the next week, but luckily, an Elements place with a similar concept opened recently in the general area. At this point, it literally cannot be any worse than massage envy. As much as I love Talisha and Aisha as massage therapists, getting a massage should feel good, and not like youre just a number to them, not like you actually have to spend more time trying to get a damn appointment than you actually get to spend IN the appointment."
3,"Decent sports bar.  Dont get me wrong, they have tons of beer choices, decent to good service, and plenty of pub fare...  Few things that bugged me last time.. No waitress for about 5 minutes after I sat down Southwest egg rolls, while good, were tiny compared to other places Too many tvs had the volume on..  the football game was impossible to hear.. Ill be back though.."
5,"Went back, they appeared to have remodeled and noise level was greatly reduced.  Food, atmosphere, everything still wonderful.  In my first review, I stated ""the only reason Im giving it less than 5-stars is because of the noise level.""  As the noise level issue appears to have been rectified, my review is subsequently being modified to reflect this. Last time I was there I had a salmon salad, which was good though in all honesty the salmon was the star of the dish.  I asked the server to please ask the chef how the salmon was cooked so such perfection.  I honestly did not expect for any type of response.  Lo and behold, a gentleman came out and explained the procedure utilized to get that sear and texture without overcooking or under-cooking the salmon. Re: Another reviewers issue with ""soggy fried calamari"" It is tempura calamari, which is different from other ways to fry the calamari.  I have never had any issues with sogginess unless I leave it to sit for too long.  Hmm...  Clearly, they prefer Zinc Bistro.  Honestly, I havent been to Zinc Bistro so I cannot draw a comparison at this time between the two. I will definitely go back as soon as I can to The Greene House -- Oh, loved the recent press on the Chefs high praise, it *is* well deserved!"
5,Fabulous service tonight and it was crowded!
4,Love Abuelos! Best Mexican food!
3,"The problem with a place like this is the hype.  Five stars from yelpers, must be amazing!  But sorry, Ive had better Eggs Benedict.  For me just too far to drive for the mediocre food and marginal service."
2,"The food leans toward the SouthWest and is located near Old Scottsdale.  The place has a couple of patios as well as couches/easy chairs for seating.  Large curved bar with televisions.  Tons of tequila.The place tends to be busy because of its location, however the food is nothing special - burgers, wraps, tacos, etc.  Prices are steep considering what you get.  Service can be spotty depending on time of day."
5,"These are some great cheesesteaks. I have come here multiplier times and have never left unhappy. The staff are nice and the food is delicious.   Also try the Cheesesteak Fries they are freakin amazing! I am glad I work next to this place, always a great lunch."
2,"I recently moved to the area of Westgate AMC and, even though its not the closest, I thought I would give it a try. Its probably one of the most beautifully laid out and convenient movie houses Ive been in. And for the first several visits, I didnt have too much of a bad experience. In fact, the only thing wrong was the ticket machines outside were down - apparently, Ive heard that happens a lot, if theyve ever worked. This last trip was just plain bad. I went to see Piranha 3D and the 3D screen was fairly small, especially for a wide release on opening night. The 3D was off a bit, but then that might be this old persons eyes; I could see shadows and lines behind some of the target objects. I arrived 45 minutes early and I mistakenly thought I would be too late to get a good seat for a 6:30 PM showing. By all means, I was approximately 30 minutes too early. They booked the showings way too close. The previous showings credits ran until about 6:10, and then they, as always, took their time to clean out the theater. Once in, finally, the theatre was almost pitch black aside from dim lights on the staircases. The Pre-Show countdown, which I normally despise, wouldve been welcome, if just for some light. Well, thats why God made cell phones. Upon finally sitting, there were two soda pop cans in the two cup holders - way to go, clean-up crew. I literally saw 7 people leave the theatre when that showing ended. Cleaning up shouldve been quick so you can continue your discussion about whos ID youd use to go out that night. But I digress, the soda pop cans were obviously not sold by the worlds slowest concession employees. I just moved them over and the lights finally came on a bit roughly 7 minutes before the show. Typically, I hate when people have their cell phones lit up in the theatre, as they always want to hold them up high so the entire rest of the theatre gets the pleasure of the bright light while they babble on their ancient MySpace account. But, in this case, its understandable as no one could see anything. Question, and Ive always wanted to ask this, are the employees at the concession stand told to go as slow...as...possible? Fine, I know theyre not - Im a former AMC employee and I wasnt. Although, the pennies they generously give in the paychecks might not put the right fire under them. But seriously, its already an insult that we have to pay about $13 just for one popcorn and one soda, but they add the salt, on the wound, that is, by making us wait 20 minutes in a line of 3 people. By God, I wish someone would open a concession stand with somewhat good deals - yeah, I know thats how they get their money, blah, blah, and I wish someone would open at least an express lane. ""Two Items or Less Lane! No Children!"" Heaven. Really, movies are still relevant, even in a down economy. Perhaps you should hire less and pay more. Im sure the one guy at the box office wouldve appreciated that."
4,"Pretty damn nice! I made reservations for the Compass via OpenTable and upon arrival, i was greeted by first name.  We were seated promptly and thank God I didnt pre-drink too much because the restaurant spins at a pretty steady pace.  Its a great concept and for all the theatrics, the cost of the meals were very reasonable.   I had salmon and opted for polenta with my meal instead of mashed potatoes and Im glad to see that both grits and polenta were mainstays on their list of sides.  The only miss for me was the chili cornbread which I didnt find to be that great, although my comrades seemed to like it.   Service was prompt and consistent and I must say I enjoyed my meal and the whole spinning experience."
4,Sauce is a great Quick Serve place.  I had the Chix Caesar Salad it was large and filling and quite good.  The sangria is nice as well...I like the koolaid touch around the edge of the glass.  My man had the bruchetta caprese style and it was awesome...the tomatoes were perfectly ripe and the mozzarella was fresh and creamy.  The bread was a really crusty yet fluffy yet able to hold up to the mix piece of wonder...we found out they get it from LaBrea.  If you want a great quick lunch or dinner check it out...we look forward to trying the pizza and pasta next time!
4,"Three stellar write-ups pushed me over the edge and I decided that it was time to take my self for a much needed pedi. When I arrived, the place was packed, but thankfully they gladly take walk-ins and I had only a brief wait before I was whisked away to my massaging, bubbling chair of goodness. I have to echo the other reviewers comments on cleanliness and down-right bargain for the service provided. Not once did I have that ""eww, you arent actually going to touch me with that"" reaction. I didnt swoon from toxic vapors as soon as opening the door. And my attendant was super friendly and completely cool with the fact that I had clearly neglected my heals for the last two months (something that was hugely apparent after she started filing away - how mortifying... skin flying everywhere!!!) And for those of you that might fear the Elaine experience (Seinfeld reference), fret not. You can actually understand everyone one that works here and shouldnt find yourself sitting and wondering ""what in the hell are they saying about me now?"" Take your twenty-bucks (plus a little extra for tip - unless you get flowers you will need thirty) and go get some much deserved pampering.  Dear Paulene - my toes and heals thank you for the love! -- see pic ; )"
4,"Talk about options!  Its almost unfair to have so many items on a menu.   Especially when the food is so good.  I have gone to the Cheesecake Factory several times and have not been able to even put a dent in the menu. So, I wasnt too hungry this time, so I decided to order from the small plates menu.  We started with the corn fritters.  Then I ordered the shrimp and grits and my husband ordered the hibachi steak.   The only reason I didnt give them five stars is because we didnt get our appetizer until the our food was ready.  And by that time, we had already stuffed our faces with bread and butter (which is delicious)!  The server apologized for delay in bringing our app and the manager came by and didnt charge us for the corn fritters.  That was much appreciated!  We only had one of the fritters since our other dishes were in front of us and we didnt want those to get cold.   I really like the shrimp and grits.  I think the dish came with a little too much sauce...but thats just me....I just really liked the taste of the cheddar grits.  My husbands steak was really really good!  The hibachi steak is what I normally ordered.  I will go back again!"
5,"Just got back from lunch here, and I must say it was delicious! We sat outside on the patio which was very nice on such a pretty sunny day. I had the beef gyro which was huge and so so yummy! It came with a fresh greek salad and a yogurt sauce and I couldnt have asked for anything more. Definitely recommend coming here!"
4,"I always enjoyed coming here after a long night of work. The staff is amazingly friendly and always made my time here great. The sliders are yummy and their appetizer platter they offer is great. You can choose between a variety of different munchies.  Over all I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a low key, bar atmosphere."
4,"I really like eating here.  I have only been for lunch, and I have found that the service is competent and friendly, and the food comes out FAST.  Ive probably eaten at MBFGR five or seven times, and the only time I had a problem was on my last visit, where they served me a plate with cold fries.  This was a mistake, as I had a slight hangover and really, really wanted my gyros pita and fries that day, so I asked for fresh fries.  Well, whether it was to apologize or to be sassy I cant say, but either way, I ended up receiving the biggest fattest plate of fresh, hot fries Ive ever seen.  They definitely made up for their faux-pas. Im a huge fan and will be back many, many times.  Opa!"
5,Wanna try it? Now is your chance! One more day of this LivingSocial deal: 12 days for $49 http://t.livingsocial.com/deals/453990?ref=email-jp&rpi=85154658
4,"Want a unique date night?  Craving for something to do on your own?  Want to have an avenue to express your inner artistic abilities?  OK, here you go! Very interesting concept: Pick a piece of pottery, think of what you would like to design on it, you can draw your idea on with pencil, go grab your paints, brush, sponges, or stencils, and away you go.  They will then fire & glaze it, ready to pick up your masterpeice in a few days, A great place to zen out and leave all your stress and worries at the door.   Good for a keepsake, special gift, 1-of-a-kind conversation piece, or create a memory. 1 star lost for the very annoying and extremely intrusive studio ""helper"" which I will leave un-named.  Kinda ruined alot of the experience.  I should say that if you need assistance, you can have it, but when you do NOT need it, well, please leave us alone - ie: i f you are in Barnes & Noble, you dont need a clerk to repeatedly come up to you every 10 mins to ask if you are going to buy that book or they read it, or do you want a better suggestion..... ect."
4,The Chorizo gravy can be habit forming.
4,"Their quinoa veggie burger is the best veggie burger Ive had in a long time. Its not dry, its flavorful and has texture to it. This is a place where I consciously choose to make room for dessert. The bread pudding is amazing, its light, its fluffy, its sweet but not *just* sweet. You know how some desserts just seem to have only one taste setting and they might as well have brought you a huge pile of sugar? The souffle is delicious as well. Nice atmosphere,  relaxed but classy."
4,I love Target.  This is a great one. Parking is decent and its right at Desert Ridge next to everything else so its a convienent location.
4,"Let me just say that The Hungry Monk has everything you need for a good happy hour. TVS surround the bar area, plenty of spacious seating and a friendly staff await your arrival. Definitely a family friendly place as well... If you get a chance try an entree that comes with pretzel bread as a bun-it was kick-ass!  Oh, and I havent been there a lot but I know they have trivia and karaoke nights too. Good times Hungry Monk!"
3,The classic example of why we need half stars.  Doesnt merit a four star endorsement but slightly better than the three star Meh.  The hot dogs are decent but youd expect more due to the pedigree of the owners.  The place also doesnt feel well put together and like its been neglected in recent times.
4,"Looooove this place.  I have to come here every time I visit Phoenix.  The rice with raisins and almonds, the baba ganoush, the hummus, the dolma, the falafel, the veggie patties... its all so delicious and vegetarian-friendly (although they have plenty of meat options for the carnivores). The portions are HUGE, so come hungry, share, and/or make room in your fridge for leftovers.  Edens Grill is staffed by a super nice family, and even though Im not a regular, I feel like one whenever I go."
5,"I have been going to Cartel for a while, and their coffee has absolutely spoiled me. I can hardly drink coffee or esspresso from anywhere else, I even buy their beans and brew it at home. Most of the bartistas are stellar, but expect to wait for your specialty drinks, not only because they are almost always busy, but also because making kick ass coffee drinks takes time. I suggest either the Honduras with cream, an iced agave latter, or a cappuccino (which you have to drink there)."
5,I been to many stadiums and this is one of my favorites. I attended a game against the Atlanta Braves and it was a great experience. Food prices are typical for any MLB stadium but get the combo meals and it seems cheaper. The bigger the beer the cheaper it seems. There really isnt a bad seat inside the entire place. Get there early enough and you can go down tot he bleachers during batting practice to catch a homerun hit. The staff is very friendly and talkative. If I lived in Arizona I would get season tickets. The merchandise pricing is pretty cheap too compared to most stadiums. $23 for a hat compared to $41 at Dodgers Stadium.
3,Not a bad place.  Pizza was good but stay away from the wraps as the flatbread wasnt meant for that.
5,"Let me start by saying that I love tacos. I eat lots of tacos. When I get hungry one of the first things to cross my mind is tacos. That said, I love El Nopalito for their tacos. Im pretty picky about my tacos. I dont really like dumb-ass flour tortillas, dry tacos, unseasoned meat in a taco, taco bell is not tacos, the list goes on. I prefer authentic Mexican street tacos. That being said, El Nopalito is the one place in town I feel like I am getting the most authentic street taco that I have been able to find in Phoenix. The only reason I am not here more often is the commute is a bit much as I live in the East Valley.  However, if I am anywhere near the area it is almost mandatory to stop and have at least a taco or two. I recommend trying all of the tacos though my favourite has to be the cabeza (it sounds creepy but is buttery and delicious). It does help if you speak Spanish as it will make ordering and asking any questions you may have easier."
4,"Its a pretty standard Panda Express- cheap pre-made Chinese food with a few different choices.  This one has always had good service, been prompt and never had a problem finding a place to sit.  They are also clean inside.  Good Panda."
4,"I LOVE this place. The marijuana theme isnt kid-friendly though, so DONT bring your kids. Just bring it home to them. Their subs are really tasty, the theme (for adults) is hilarious, the people are friendly, and are reasonably priced. Also, the potato salad is fantastic!"
4,"Valet only parking, unless you want to try parking by the bank. Last two times we werent able to. Not crazy about their cocktails (pretty weak) but the Bloody Mary was a welcome start to our Sunday brunch. Its not listed on their menu but they have gluten free options. Tried the egg bake, pretty good. The salmon and pork chile verde are delish (love the homemade cornbread). Overall, the atmosphere and food make this a great brunch or lunch time spot!"
4,"Im huge fan of this place. Its tough for me and my wife to Love this place due to the Gilty feeling of bad eating we get after visiting this establishment. The food is Outstanding and Ive liked everything except the Catfish fried. My wife enjoys the catfish, but I think its lacking flavor, however they fry it to a cripy golden brown crust. I could just eat the crust and forget the fish.  Weve been twice now and Im sad to say that we pretty much ordered the same things twice. The garlic parmesan wings and honey habenero wings are our favorites (of course we havent tried any others, so take it with a grain of salt) catfish, corn nuggets, fried okra, french fries, and coleslaw. And to finish it all off...the best Biscuits of all time, if you consider a biscuit a French dougnut.(beignet) a biscuit. Seriously the best thing ever, but you feel pretty guilty afterwards.  My recommendation is to hit the gym prior to going so you dont feel so guilty!  But what ever you do, GO......"
4,"Im still a big fan of the light rail! Sure, I cant use it every day, but its about the only thing that will get me to head to downtown for a night out.   Its perfect for pub crawls, you can gather a huge group, keep everyone more or less together, and make frequent stops.  The extended hours mean more time for drinking! The trains have stayed clean, they run when they are supposed to, and Ive never had a problem.  The people watching is awesome as well.  Each stop is a mystery grab bag of the teeming masses of people here in town.  I just wish it had a wider range, Id use it every day if I could."
2,"Over-priced, over-crowded and every time I have been there...it has confirmed that they pour the worst martini! But if you are looking to people watch this is the place - the interior permits a great open ambiance  with an open area overlooking the bar. I think the exhaust-system isnt strong enough for the Teppan tables because I smell like heavy fried food when I leave!!"
3,"Its three stars because I dont know how to rate it -- I didnt think it was very good at all when I went the other night during their grand opening, but maybe I just dont have a taste for it.  Service was prompt and polite.  The food?  Eh.  I had one of the house specials.  I didnt think it was very special.  I do think the waiter deserves bonus points for talking me into a half order rather than a full order.  The lemon-lime beverage was strong and sweet."
4,The pizzas very good! Unusual in that you have to order and pay first but they different combo pizzas are good. My favorite so far is the spicy chicken.
2,Service was s l o w. Toook a l o n g time for someone to greet us and when they did only dropped off menus. Wait. Wait. We ordered beverages and food at same time. Things showed up one by one... I ordered the Spicy Basil which was very flavorful and I thought was the best tasting of the 3 entrees.
4,"Great food and a fun atmosphere! service is a little slow, but the food is always delicious!"
3,"Im torn. I LOVED my $20 facial. Ill probably go back for more once Groupon and the like run out of deals. However, I also got a brow and eyelas tinting.  I wouldnt recommend that service from here.  My brows were uneven, and my lashes faded out quicker than normal."
4,"oh my, these are huge gyros.  somewhat scary looking at first.  not pressed in their cellar but good enough to find on a food cart in nyc.  simply can not beat the value if you are hungry for lunch.  they do need some greek coffee though. with all the i heart chicago wallpaper, youd think they would have a plasma TV with my big fat greek wedding on repeat play,"
5,love love love it! What a quaint little piece of heaven. Located south phoenix...I wasnt sure what this place would look like as we kept driving south but as we walked onto the property it felt as if you were no longer in the big overcrowded city. We went to the morning glory cafe for breakfast. The food was wonderful and the presentation was great! I highly recommend it. It would make a wonderful place for a baby or wedding shower!!
3,"Over-priced for the size of the facility and equipment available. The staff is friendly enough, and seeing as how its the closest 24 hour fitness place in this neighborhood, i suppose they get away with the price :)"
5,Guacamole was best Ive had!
4,"After long debate of where to have lunch, I am glad that I stopped into The Greek Pita.   I had ordered the lamb gyro with everything except onions.  The gyro was loaded with lamb meat and toppings.  The pita was soft and fresh. The Tzatziki sauce  has a nice tang to it.  It tasted light, cool, and creamy.   The total cost was $5.74 + tax.  I left with a very happy belly."
4,"Good things about the Merc Bar:   Its dark inside and the decor makes it feel kinda swanky.   The service is very friendly.   They have lots of comfy chairs and couches for anyone to sit down.   The location is good - in the Esplanade, right across from the Biltmore,  where theres lots of restaurants you might be eating at (and includes free parking in the garage if you validate!) and its kinda hidden, so you feel cool going there.   They have a great drink menu with a wide selection. Minus one star because the drinks are a little on the pricey side. I know there have been some negative reviews about the old age of the regular patrons, but honestly, when Ive been there, its been a good mix of 20-somethings to 40-somethings.  If youre in the Biltmore area, Merc Bar is definitely a place worth checking out as a start to the night or for a date."
2,"Have been here several times prior, food is ok and service is mediocre at best. Sitting at the bar to eat and drink does not = fast, quality service. It equates to unattentive bartenders watching sports rather than clearing plates or pouring drinks. An empty pint should have another offered in its place, and napkins on plates are clear indicators that one is done! Fifteen minutes passed before plates were cleared!!! Service MUST improve!!!"
1,"Not a fan.  I was in the Biltmore yesterday shopping with my dog and decided to go and buy her a few treats.  As I picked out a bag of about 20 baked treats, my total came to be about $3.00.  I did not have any cash on me so I took out my ""plastic money"" the debt card and they wouldnt take it telling me that I needed to buy a few more things because they have a $5.00 minimum.  What store has a minimum nowadays???   The customer service was also very lack luster.  The dogs of the store employees were jumping on me which I found a bit annoying.  Needless to say a store that I used to like, I will no longer be back.  There are so many other great dog stores..."
4,Excellent service and food. Very clean. Friendly folks. Beautiful patio
5,"EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!  Even with Happy Hour in full swing and the place full of parched Winkies, the service at our large table was spot on. We barely had time to settle our bums and push the silver out to claim our table territory before iced H20 was before us, our drink orders were taken . . . and one quick blink of the eye and the ""peacemakers"" were before us!   Now thats what I call HAPPY HOUR! Bravo Thirsty Lion!"
1,"I dont think anyone who gave over a 2 has ever eaten Italian food in Chicago.  I struggled to give 2 stars, but figured the wings were decent . #1) No celery salt on the Dog #2) No cucumber on the Dog #3) WORST OF ALL the GYRO, was not off a spit it was processed #4) Also, living 30 years in Chicago I have never had a gyro covered in more lettuce than there were onioins.  #5) Since when does a Gyro (not in Chicago) have Feta Cheese & almost not Tatziki #6) The PIZZA IS NOT CHICAGO STYLE ITS 100% New York #7) Wings are a 6 out of 10 #8) THERE IS NO DEEP DISH PIZZA OFFERED OR THICK CRUST??? #9) I apologize they have now gone from 2 to 1 star...  PLEASE CHANGE YOUR NAME YOU""RE A DISGRACE TO CHICAGO!!! Dont think I will give this place another shot no reason"
3,I came in here to order to get takeout it was 19.99 For 2 cheese pizzas ummm not so cheap. They only use 1 type of cheese the pizza was not great I wouldnt go that route again but I am willing to go back and try the Veggie pizza. I surprised my brother with some suicide wings I dont eat meat but I did try the sauce and ate some w my pizza it was HOT. He loved them all 20 were gone at the end of the night. They said they were SO HOT but the boys just couldnt stop eating them. They said they were very good meaty and not too vinegary. An extra star for making the boys happy with the hella hot wings that night. FYI they probably use hydrogenated oils here by the way but I didnt ask!
5,"Im a bit of a snob, I admit it. I generally prefer the full-service pamper me kind of salons that charge an arm and a leg. But times are tight - and I want my nails and my money.  Enter Biagio.  When you first walk into Biagio you would think you had walked into a fancy day spa. But when you read the prices, you wonder how they can stay in business. A ""spa"" pedicure, one of the most expensive treatments, is a whopping $49 (I say whopping with a sense of sarcasm). Not only do you get a great pedicure (best Ive EVER received), but you get a leg and neck massage (yes the chairs are massage chairs, but real hands give you a real massage).  A ""spa"" manicure, which also comes with a neck massage, is $25.  The technicians are very nice, the store is immaculate, the tools are all sterilized, and the treatments are very high quality (even for a snob like me). Plus the atmosphere makes you feel like you are at a spa, not a strip-mall dive nail salon.  I highly recommend Biagio. I have been there several times, and plan to go back often."
3,"Great place, well maintained. Its big airport with some long walks."
5,"Just went to this theater last night, and it was great!  Started with friendly staff...every one of them! (not common these days)  Went to get a popcorn, and the nice girl suggested....""why dont you press your button at your seat and someone will come serve you!  Take advantage of the service!""  We went to our seat and after we pressed the service button, someone came within a few minutes.  There was a full menu at our fingertips...including alcohol and specialty coffees.  Our seats were comfortable, leather (or pleather), roomy, we could stretch out our legs without touching the chairs in front of us, we had 3 cup holders between the both of us, and the seats leaned back.  Not a bad seat in the theater...we got to pick our seats BEFORE we went into the movie on a touch screen computer/pad.   Im really impressed with the prices, too, because for just $2 more than a regular, cramped, loud, teenager-infested movie theater, we felt like we were getting First Class treatment, all night!  The snack, food and drink prices are typical for a movie theater; but not more than it would be elsewhere.  Pretzel was about $4.50 and Hummus was about $6.50 for example.   Im sad to read Ruth Anns review because it sounds like an isolated incident, and it also sounds like they did a lot to take care of the issues she had...an experience cant be absolutely perfect.  In my case, there was a little bit of stickiness near my cup holder, but thats not something that will bring my experience down an entire star or 3!  Go to this theater!  Its really a great night out! (As long as you like the movie you pick, which we did :)"
4,"great, family owned place that feels like the kind of italian joint that is made with love.  Food options are very good with traditional italian dishes and unique entrees that cant be found elsewhere."
1,"I would absolutely not recommend living here. I lived at these apartments for a year, and wow was the management staff a MESS. When I moved in, my mailbox was broken so I couldnt get mail for a week. They didnt give me a pool key, they gave me the wrong apartment keys, they would mix up all my information, and they just werent very nice. I cant remember how many times they lost my work orders so Id have to call and call to make sure things got fixed in my apartment! The neighbors were loud--I had to call the police maybe four times because they wouldnt turn down their music and I had to study for school and finals, and random people came banging on the door looking for some girl who had obviously pd them off. The police came to my house in the middle of the night looking for her, too. One time, they gave my garage to somebody else even though I was still paying for it and when my husband came home in the evening with his pick-up full of expensive equipment, we had to wait for the cops to come and figure out whose car it was who was parked in our garage! it was a total nightmare. Shortly before I moved out new staff came in and they seemed somewhat better organized. But---I wouldnt take the chance. For the same price, you can definitely find somewhere better to live."
4,"The new store is smaller than the previous one. But its still a reliable digging source for records. I wish there was a better selection of dance tracks, but that isnt really their thing. They did have the new Chromatics and Glass Candy 12"" singles when I was in there last, which was nice. Great selection of hip hop vinyl, some awesome indie records, etc. Definitely recommend this if youre in the Tempe area."
5,"Hes been the top vote-getting General Dentist in Phoenix Magazine for three years in a row for a REASON, folks. He has an office in Chandler and in Mesa but even if you live in Minnesota, hes worth the drive."
4,"6.30 on a Sunday and there was a line snaking through the small shop. We took turns sneaking peaks at the days options and by the time we got up front we were ready to order.  We got the salted caramel and chocolate marshmallow. The 1st was so good, the 2nd kinda boring. Cant wait to try more."
4,"UnPhogettable- a poem Trying new things can be oh so frightful so it helps to have owners that are oh so delightful Start out with springs rolls to begin the meal, I liked the peanut sauce so much that I let out a squeal! And ah the pho, the main show if you will,  both my tummy and soul it did fill. Ive also had their chicken dishes a time or two, those are quite good if soups not for you. The lighting is dim and the tables lack in style, but once you get past that youll be there a while."
5,"A group of us from the IVAA Summit went to Zinburger last night. The food & service was great! I think we scared our poor server (Mike), but he was wonderful!"
4,"My mother located this resturant and wanted to go. I of course, looked at the reviews on yelp and was expecting a lukewarm time wih flavorless food.  I went to pepin last night and was pleasantly surprised to find the opposite.  There were 3 adults and 1 child in our party. My 2 1/2 yo decided to get cranky the moment we sat down.  The place was about 1/2 full.  Our waitress came right over to our table and started to take drink orders.  My mother didnt like the location of the table so they promptly moved us to a table of her satisfaction. The waitress saw my child was squirmy and offered to get her food out right away which she did.  I had the red sangria. It was good but Ive had better. My mother had the tiramisu drink that was so strong it knocked her sandles off but it was good. I had the paella which was good and tasty. My mom had lamb which she enjoyed.  I forgot what the 3rd party had but he enjoyed his. My baby had chicken fingers and fries which were actually sliced potato and she ate most of it. The entertainment was great! I kept laughing to myself about the other reviewer who said they were intent on driving nails through the floor. Yes they were stomping up a storm but it was great. My baby was so entertained and yelling and clapping. Everyone was entertained by her too. Our bill came to $123 which is not bad for food and entertainment. Oh it was saturday night about 6:15pm"
4,"the things I liked: the cart.  it was much smaller than a regular shopping cart, but somehow our  baby carrier fit in it with-wise. * Update ( they got rid of the small carts.) You can fill it up and not spend $300. This has happened to me before at Frys, and its a bummer. Since they are new, they are the cleanest they will ever be. I have a huge dirty cart handle issue. F&E like most grocery stores have the disinfectant wipes but that grosses me out more for some reason. the steering on the carts was easy like ikeas carts with out the crazy hydroplane maneuver. The food. Everything F&E brand had very minimal marketing on the packaging which made me feel like i was purchasing it for the quality of food, not how nice the fake prepared image on the front looked.  I have yet to taste it though, ill update when I do. * Update (Prepared food is kinda hit or miss) They have only 1 or maybe 2 brands of the same exact item which makes decisions easy, either you want it or dont, no comparing labels and whatnot. which makes you end up buying less stuff. It also makes for a shorter trip to the grocery store. No more putting off going to the market. Even though I have managed to make myself only shop the outside of the gigantic grocery stores (Produce, meat, dairy bakery) it still takes a long time to trek through the store. Last grabs. If you needed  they have a small pharmacy aisle grocery brand pet food, and baby care/household aisle. shampoo.... whatever. One of these things is not like the other... so the chip aisle has F&E brand chips and cookies and all nicely packaged and then at the end were flaming hot Cheetos? maybe thats the part where they sell local goods. frito-lay is the best we have? They do not take American express and watch out for the fine print on the coupons. * Update ( They now accept AMEX) $. Somethings cost much less than at normal markets, and some were the exact same.  they also discount Items that are close to their expiration, so you can go ahead and grab that milk instead of pulling 3 out looking for the latest expiration. same thing with baked goods, meat products and produce. you will definitely see me there again."
3,"I like F&E. There are some good things in there, but its kind of like you have to play by its own rules. If you walk in with one specific item on your list, (Examples: pico de gallo. Not that uncommon, right? How about good hamburger buns? Only one kind? Really?) chances are you might not find it. But, you will be tempted by the premade meals and delightful snacks. Fresh chicken salad? I didnt know I wanted that when I walked in, but now I have it.  Dont come here if you have a strict list that you need to shop for or if youre seeking hard-to-find items. Come here with a friend late on a sunday night when you need ideas to make meals for the rest of the week. The store is indeed freezing cold and kind of has that sterile hospital feeling. Lots of really bright lights and WHITE everywhere. The 50% off stuff is great. I got a big package of fettuccine for a dollar. Their prices are a bit odd, though. $0.99 for a pack of four bratwurst, and $2.50 for a can of generic tuna? Well, alright. Ill be back! But now I know under what circumstances to shop here. Highlight: This location seems to be run by a rather sassy nun."
5,"Two words for you. Mouth.  Orgasm Wifey and I decided to eat here for our 5 year wedding anniversary. I have to say this is one of the best meals Ive ever eaten, hands down. We bought a Restaurant.com gift certificate that cost $10.00 for a $50.00 Gift Certificate. They also have half priced bottles of wine on Friday nights as well. I went with the 5 course menu. I chose 2 of the dishes, and let the chef pick the other three. We started out with the Crudo Cheese plate that was phenomenal! It had goat cheese, goat feta, goat mozarella (sooo good), cherry compote, roasted dates, tomatoes, cured lamb jerky, smoked olives and truffles with toast. If that doesnt give you a food stiffy, your not human. The first dish I had, which was one I picked, was the butterfish crudo. It was served with oven roasted tomatoes and lardo with some sort of escebeche type sauce, hands down my favorite plate in Phoenix right now. Holey cow! Next, I had the albacore crudo with truffles, apples, black garlic and pepper. Another amazing dish. My next dish was one the chef selected as well, it was their Japanese Fish Market Special. I dont recall the type of fish, but it was good. I felt bad for this plate though, it had to follow some illlll dishes. The 4th course I had was the mushroom gratin. It had hen of the woods, crimini, potato and was topped with an egg. I felt it was just too much, a little clunky. Thats probably just my taste though, there was nothing wrong with the execution of the dish. I finished with the roasted veal served with parmesan creamy polenta. Friggin amazing, I wanted to whisper sweet nothing into its ear and smack it on the boohiney.   We went with a great bottle of Nebbiolo, that was exceptional. The service was excellent. At first I was kind of weirded out with the restaurant being inside a retail shop, but we moved to one of the high top tables and it felt more like a quaint little cafe. What a great meal, fargin amazing!!  Pics to come"
5,"The pupusas, yes, the pupusas are great. The loroco with cheese has become our favorite, But this past week, I strayed from our standard and tried the gallina soup with braised chicken and salad. All I can say is, ""What the hell? Where has this been my whole life?"" The soup is magical. Huge chunks of carrot, potato, and zucchini, with some thin noodles, and a savory broth with some mint leaves. I quickly abandoned the rest of my entree in favor of finishing the huge bowl of magic. It was the best soup Ive had since coming to Phoenix 13 years ago.  Good thing Hubby got sick this weekend- it gave me an excuse to go back and get some more. Being magical, you know it has serious healing properties. Heres where I learned that the Sopa de Gallina is chicken soup without the chicken meat and the Sopa de Pollo is the same thing but with the meat. Two huge Styrofoam cups to go with lemon wedges and 4 hot and fresh tortillas cost less than $6.00. I was stunned. The owner said it costs more with meat. Believe me, you wont miss it. Who knew that magic was so cheap? Hubbys fever is already down and hes feeling much better."
4,"I was in Scottsdale from California with some friends to catch the end of Dodgers spring training and to get in a couple of rounds of golf.  We came here wanting to watch the Lakers game, but unfortunately, they dont have the NBA package so we had to settle on watching the Suns game on ESPN. My friends and I ordered the fried clams, a salad and three burgers.  We all thought the food was good as well as the service.  Drinks were tasty and our server Heather was very attentive and was always coming by to make sure we were well taken care of.  Well definitely come back!"
1,"I can summarize this in one word.  YUCK!  We went for dinner/supper, which is part of the problem.  We ordered t-bone steak and chicken.  The salad bowl had a hole right through the plastic and the steak was way thin.  We ordered it medium and any steak that thin just ends up being cooked as ""well done"" anyway.  Everything comes with grease dripping hash browns whether you want them or not.  At least the staff was friendly enough and food (if you call it that) was served quickly.  My personal recommendation is that if youre not going to eat breakfast, go somewhere else."
4,"It was as good as everyone says!  And sooo inexpensive...appetizers, entrees, and drinks for 3 people...about 30 bones.  Not to mention the mountain of leftovers we brought home."
5,"Unlike other reviewers, I didnt like the buffet, though my friends from work think its a good value. However, Ive been going for dinner to Flavors of India for nearly three years now, and have ALWAYS liked the food. FOI is my first choice for Indian cuisine in Phoenix, out of the four other Indian restaurants in the valley Ive tried.  Yes, FOI is in a strip mall, but once inside, the ambiance is pleasant. It seems quite clean, I never got sick from anything I ate there (thats saying a lot, as I admit to being a fussy eater), and the waitstaff is helpful. Bollywood videos on the large flat-screen wall display in the corner are an unusual feature, but the volume is low or completely muted, so you can watch or choose not to, it isnt distracting.   (Heres a footnote about that: I ate at FOI on the night of the presidential primary election. My dining companion noticed that most of the waitstaff was gathered around the TV in the bar, watching electoral results, so he asked our waiter if we could watch too. After getting the enthusiastic okay from the two other occupied tables, it was quite late in the evening, silent Bollywood was replaced by live news coverage with volume turned on). Regarding the food: I love their mattar paneer (cooked peas in a tasty curried gravy, with small cubes of homemade mild-tasting cheese).  My super-spicy friend gets the lamb vindaloo (super-spiced as he requests).  Tandoori shrimp, chicken and tikka masala are good though a bit pricier, the samosa appetizer (lightly battered and deep-fried cut vegetables) is fresh, warm and crunchy. Regular and garlic nan bread are everything they should be, biryani rice is overpriced (Id stick with basmati rice as a side dish), and sweet lassi (a well-chilled dairy drink, similar in taste and consistency to a vanilla yogurt smoothy) is a nice treat. My spicy friend says his gin-and-tonic was weak, and they dont have ingredients to make a Bloody Mary, but hey, FOI is an Indian restaurant, so I cant fault them too much for that!  Other pluses: open a bit later than many Phoenix restaurants (seating ends at 9:30 pm); very fast with takeout orders; theres lots of parking; the 16 North bus stop is nearby; silverware, glasses, white cotton tablecloths and napkins are always spotlessly clean."
4,"This is a beautiful store. Its huge and spacious. The workers are friendly and helpful. You cant go wrong with cute, nerdy boys who help you fix things! :]"
5,"Whitney walked into Renegade Canteen and never had a chance. Nor did any of her previous favorite Scottsdale spots.  The green chile pork stew is enough to make a good date great or a bad date totally tolerable. Tender, juicy, sent from above...having this dish once is not enough. You wont have the heart to inform your mother that after tasting McGraths bowl of deliciousness, any pork dish shes ever prepared seems dry and flavorless.  We can only hope that the clouds in heaven are made of the mashed potatoes. I get them every time. The filet was the best steak Ive ever had (Ive thought about it, trust me) and the Dr. Pepper braised short rib will give you something else to think about the next time the Kiss ""Dr. Love"" commercial comes on.  yummmmmmers."
4,"Flavor was good and it was very clean.  Only complaint is that it melted very fast, but if you eat it there (as I did twice), its not a problem."
5,"I LOL just thinking about some of the cast members and skits that I have seen at Jesterz. The first time I saw Jesterz, I was expecting it to be pretty awkward and honeslty didnt know what to expect. I was blown away how funny it got at times. Good clean funny. We went again soon after the first time but didnt go again for a good 2 years, we went back recently and was kinda worried as the crowd was not as big as past times. Even with a smaller crowd there were tons of LOL moments. Writing about it kinda makes me want to go back."
5,"Cork is an enigma. What makes it enigmatic is how damn good it is... Too good for Chandler and maybe too good for the valley. The portions are just right, and anybody that tells you otherwise is a fat ass or a glutton (Im 63, 200lbs. and I was satisfied).  If you want large portions though, go to their lunch/brunches.  Ive been there twice and had The Lamb Chop, which was amazing on all levels, and Ive had some serious lamb in rural Bosnia, which has been labeled the best in their country... sure enough corks stood up blow for blow.  The other entrée I experienced was the buttermilk fried chicken.  I was so amazed by the lamb the first time, that I had to try something more ""simple"" in order to qualify their food in regards to regular places.  Lets just say the chicken was not regular, it was outstanding.  The appetizers are crazy good... can anyone say king crab legs? The wine selection is top notch.  the booze selection is killin, and they even make this amazing Italian lemon stuff thats like 90% alcohol.  make sure you have a designated driver, because this place will inspire winos and boozers to indulge to their fullest. Go to Cork, because its that damn good!"
4,Funny how progress sometimes catches you off guard!  My local Frys is going through a revamp and now I have no idea where anything is. Its just momentary inconvenience- I will find my bearings again and appreciate the improvements!
1,"Ive been boycotting this store since 2009.  One afternoon after browsing for a while with my kids, I allowed my 10yo and 8yo to stay in the childrens section to pick out a book to spend their allowance money on while I ran next door to TJ Maxx to buy the toddler a pair of shoes.  Id been gone 30 minutes when I returned to find the horrid lady in the childrens section had called the police on us.  She never asked the kids  their ages and didnt ask if they had a way to reach me (they did).  The police talked to them, realized they were perfectly well behaved consumers, and assured me Id done nothing illegal.  Avoid like the plague."
5,"Sometimes things happen, and when they do this is the place where you want them taken care of. The orthopedics department and trauma department have some of the best, and nicest Doctors youll find in the state."
5,"Juan Jaimes is where the simple taste of Mexico are served with delectable results.  The kitchen produces vibrant fiesta flavors that left me wanting more. The simple menu offers approachable, exciting, delicious food that satisfies any appetite.  The Margaritas flavor should be praised. And the staff is top notch.  This is just what Chandler needed.  If you go ask for the Grilled Mahi Mahi.  Youll thank me later.  I cant wait to go back."
3,"I cant help but feel the same sentiment as Nathan S. - I sort of feel bad giving this place only 3 stars with all the other rave reviews.   Let me start with the positives -    I love love that the place is so small and intimate.  Especially in comparison to most Valley restaurants that are just cavernous.  And with the European-style seating you have to get friendly with your neighbors.  Both of these things make this feel like a good NY restaurant.   I also love the atmosphere and decor in general.  Very authentic Spanish, very laid back, not all hip and modern like most restaurants try to be these days.   The service was extremely friendly, from the hostess to all of the waiters and waitresses and bus boys that came by.   My husband really liked the Sangria (Tinto) - he said it wasnt very strong but tasted great.   Indeed, all of the food tasted very good.  Our two favorite dishes happened to be the daily specials - the Eggplant Barcelona and the Turkish Custard dessert.  But the Tortilla Patatas and the Gambas and the Spinach with Garbanzos were all great as well.   Now to the negatives -    Firstly, selection was dreadful all around.  The wine list was very minimal, and the very limited bar didnt help.  And there were only about 8 dishes to choose from.  When I go for Tapas, the whole point is having a wide variety of small plates to choose from!   Every dish was DROWNED in oil.  Literally, bowls of oil.  The food just sat in my stomach afterwards, and I felt like I needed to take a shower to rid myself of all the grease.   The sizes of the dishes were very inconsistent.  I know its tapas, and I love me some tapas, but generally at tapas places I find you could likely split each dish three ways.  The Gambas and the Spinach were both huge piles that could have been split up to 4 ways.  But then the Tortilla Patatas was barely large enough to split two ways, and then our two favorite dishes - the Eggplant Barcelona and the Turkish Custard - were both smaller than a deck of cards and splitting them just two ways left us each with a single forkful of food.  There was a party of 4 next to us that put in 1 order of the Pork Tenderloin and the waitress said, ""You should really get 2 or 3 orders of that so everyone can try some.""  3 orders for 4 people to try it?!   Then, right along with the food size is the price.  $90 (incl tip) for the 4 tapas mentioned above, plus a glass of sangria, 2 glasses of wine, the dessert, and an espresso.  2 of the tapas were one bite per person.  Yikes.   The food, while good, was nothing outstanding.  There was no dish that made me stop and say ""wow, now that is well done.""  They were solid but not amazing.  (As opposed to the Lomo Embuchado at Cobras y Matadors in LA that I was ready to marry and make babies with). So all in all, Id say a 3.5 star experience, rounded down because it just wasnt a 4 for me.  I cant help but compare this place to my favorite tapas place in the valley, Sol y Sombra in the DC Ranch, where they have a huge selection of fantastic wine (and a full bar) and a huge selection of delicious and much larger portioned tapas for the same price."
5,These are absolutely my favorite donuts in the whole wide world!!! No offense to those Krispy Kreme lovers out there but I think Lamars has them beat!  Their donuts are always so fresh and delicious! My absolute favorite is the chocolate iced cake donut with m&ms. Just thinking about them is making me salivate! ;-)!!  I suggest getting there earlier rather than later because sometimes they sell out of certain varieties.
5,I love this place: look for the specials and the different events they always have going on. Its a great spot in the Valley.
1,"I found Lisa Gs while driving through phoenix with a friend. The exterior looked promising and we prepared ourselves for a treat. We were in for a a shock! We ordered the antipasto plate and while there were serious issues with it, it turned out to be the best thing we were served. I ordered the chicken rolatini (the special of the day) and it was just plain bad! The chicken was dry and under seasoned, the Rosemary potatoes were soggy  and the veggie medley  (squash, corn, green beans, etc.) was over cooked and the juices spilled over into the potatoes. It was one of the worst $17 meals that I have ever had! My friend ordered the veggie salad and it was one literal hot mess. Just horrible food! I see that others had the mini burgers and bowl of balls and found them to be tasty. I wish I had ordered those. As it is this is one place I would never revisit or recommend to a friend!"
5,"How can something so simple taste sooo good? I wish there were one more on the west side. I hate going to the fair to get my fix of fry bread. There needs to be one of these on every  corner of the compass in Phoenix! As Rachel Ray would say, ""Yummy!"""
4,"Very good, cheap Chinese food. Lots of specials including beer.  The only problem was that one of the servers had her two kids there who were making noise and literally crawling on the patrons tables. If this is a regular occurrence, get the food to go."
3,"Like many of my fellow Yelpers, I too take issue with the ladies at the MAC counter, but not necessarily Nordstroms as the ""store.""  After using my pressed powder compact to the point of ""crumbs,"" I prepared for battle and a trip to the mall.  But, before leaving home, I checked my email for sales and specials.  What I discovered is the best thing ever!  Yes, this is drum roll worthy - so start tapping!  Nordstroms offers FREE shipping & FREE returns!  Every item on the website regardless of price can be shipped to your door for (in case you didnt get it the first time) FREE!  Needless to say I put down the sword, took off my armor, and ordered my compact online.  I am now ""crumb-free!"""
4,"Nice place surrounded by many fast food places. No grease here!  Breads are wonderful, but customer service was just ok.  Great pastries and part of the Belly loyalty program.  Super dog friendly as well with the outdoor seating."
5,"I dont have much time to write this, but I do want to say a few things.  I had four things so far here. My friend and I both enjoyed them immensely. I paid $16 + tip.  I had the [A1 - Cha Gio - crispy egg rolls ] & [A2 - Goi Cuon Thit Tom - spring rolls] to start. Oh man was this delicious. The first thing I loved when I walked in was the ambiance. Dim lit and let the sun do the lighting - very zen - if youre into that. I felt very comfortable here. They had four sauces on the table. I have no idea what they are, but the one with red pepper flakes and oil -- the darker one -- oh wow. If you like heat added to whatever youre doing -- wow -- this stuff is for you! I loved it.  Then I went with the Pho tai - sirloin soup. [P2* - Pho tai] - wow - broth was amazing. Everything was.  For me, enjoying food means I need a few things.  First - awesome food Second - ambiance Third - presentation They had it all. I was very impressed by place to the plates. Dont change a thing. I hope  your business is very prosperous!"
4,I had southwest salad.  red velvet cheesecake mmmmmmm
4,"Tried Ling & Louies for the first time, different than the traditional for sure. Service and food were both excellent. We tried the duck sliders,lucky lo mein rice, orange peel chicken & beef & broccoli."
5,"In terms of Mexican joints this place is the best.  With the outdoor atmosphere, tacky decor and authentic food, it just doesnt get any better.  The other locations are just as good.  The staff is usually pretty cool too, although one time we waited a VERY long time to get served at the Scottsdale location."
4,Great location and within walking distance to Scottsdale and old Scottsdale.  Really well maintained and bed / pillow were the most comfy ever!  We typically stayed at another resort but this was a great substitute. They allow pets in many rooms so request a non-pet room if you wish.
5,"Impossibly good Italian deli in the middle of the desert. Huge sandwiches on the most incredible bread youve ever had outside of NY. As someone who ate here 3 times in a 24 hr period, I feel especially compelled to tell you about their cheesesteak. HO-LY-SHIT. Easily the most decadent, flavorful cheesesteak Ive had in a VERY long time - and I live 15 minutes outside of Philly. Im still in disbelief that they could pull something like that off. Ask for yours on the soft roll. I should also mention the sausage,  peppers & onion sandwich, which was really good. I suspect they make their own sausage, which elevates them to superstar status in my book. The chicken parm sandwich and dinner are both equally good, and the meatball sandwich deserves honorable mention as well. I dont do cold subs, but the ones I saw coming out of the kitchen looked huge and tasty. Perhaps I will try their pizza next time Im in town."
1,"I guess this is an east coast/midwest thing because I really dont get it. Im not a picky eater and I HATE wasting food and money, but I could not finish my plate. I ordered french toast and I was not aware that my french toast was going to be deep fried. Seriously, when I put my fork through it, a piece of fried toast hit me in the eye. My husband was also not impressed with his food. If someone would like to suggest something delicious on the menu that I should try, please let me know because I currently want to vomit every time I see a Chompies."
4,"This place is very cool and laid back.  Apparently Unlce Bear was someones dog b/c there are dog pics plastered all over this place.  If you are a dog or even a pet lover in general you would appreciate the decor/vibe of this grill/bar.  It is literally a ""throw your peanut shells on the floor"" joint (they come served in a dog dish) with very cold beer on tap and an eclectic mix of people that dine here.  The Gilbert location is a bit more conservative versus the East Mesa spot.  People in Gilbert seem to think its ok to bring their small children to bars!  I am a huge fan of the BBQ chicken quesadilla (or you can get it served as a pizza).  I really havent tried much else on the menu b/c I cant seem to stray from my BBQ chicken; It is yummy and when I lived in the east Valley I would dine there about once a week."
5,"This an incredible church that embraces the principle that ......Christ Life Church exists to bring people into a life-changing relationship with Jesus Christ.  Three campuses allow Christ Life to reach into several locations...online, Tempe and Casa Grande.   The wonderful childrens and youth programs appeal to a wide perspective of people."
5,"Wow...  I regress into some sort of 90s Valley Girl stereotype when chirping in delight over how good Switch is! How I was missing  a review for a Short List restaurant that I recommend to ev-er-yyyyy one I meet who is new to Phoenix and even remotely cool!? Switch is reliably good food served in a reliably good atmosphere by reliably good servers. The combination of service, setting and grub makes Switch a go-to for affordable dining that has appeal for a wide variety of people. If I think that someone might be too uptight or too culinarily safe to really enjoy Fez I know that I can take them to Switch, they can hone in on comfort food basics and I will still have an enjoyably awesome dining experience myself because all the basics are done with love, care and actual effort.  I think I prefer Switchs menu to Fezs because of the combination of classic choices mixed in with flavor play and more diverse fare. And we end up at Switch a lot because they have awesome outdoor loungey space which works for friends who are smokers and for a quieter, more intimate chic and cool dinner-drinks and gossip night.  Its really a gift to have this place in Downtown and a real gem in the Valley overall. We have on occasion had our asses kicked by the bar, specifically by the Drunken Italian Sodas which are so very, very good!"
3,"Theres just something about this place I dont like. I love the wine list I love dim lighting, caves, couches, sausage and cheese platters.... Just cant put my finger on it, but I would rather sit at the bar at Cowboy Ciao then have to hang out here.  *Shrug* The bartenders were a bit snotty last time I was there... maybe thats it.  Hmph."
4,"This place was never attractive to me, until it was the only place showing a good documentary I wanted to watch. Nice surprise! I only expect to see other good alternative movies here more often."
4,We stopped here on our way back from Wildlife World Zoo after seeing they changed the restaurant there and it doesnt have very good reviews. This was a great alternative. Plenty of food and a nice variety. I enjoyed it.
3,"U.S. Egg is situated directly across the street from Dennys.  A nicer and classier environment than Dennys but the quality of food is similar (well, slightly better) and a bit pricier.  Service here was really friendly however. Ordered the Triple Play (pancakes, eggs, and bacon) but substituted the regular pancakes with their famous protein pancakes which are packed with oatmeal, blueberries and cinnamon.  Bacon and eggs are always good, tough to mess those up.  The protein pancakes had a nice flavor, but the oatmeal which is mixed within the batter before they are poured on to the griddle actually messes with fluffy texture that I enjoy whenever I eat pancakes. If you are really big on breakfast and brunch food and dont want to eat at a nationwide chain restaurant it may be worth it to check this place out, just temper your expectations on the protein pancakes."
4,"This review is for the cooking class... I was told about this class by my favorite Thai joint in Chandler. My mom and I went not really knowing what to expect. The class is held on a Staurday. When Chris called to confirm our reservation he made sure to let us know that a cab my be needed to take us home...sounds good to me. The classroom is small seating about 20 people at the most. There were mimosas waiting for us.  The class started with introductions to the variuos Thai cooking ingredients. I found this information so interesting. How do you know which fish sauce to buy, what the different pastes smell and taste like, how to grow your own Lemongrass and so much more.  We started by making Siamese Kisses. It was all hands on and really fun. The next was a fresh red curry paste. Then we compared the fresh to the store bought brand. What a difference! The Arizona Heatwave was next. So Delish. The final dish was Asian Pumpkin Custard. We tasted everything along the way and then they served us HUGE portions of the items for lunch with a Champange paring. The Chamange paring was also very informative and the pours were never ending. He was right about having a DD lined up... The staff really cares about the food they produce and will make any dietary adjustments you may need. I really had a great time."
5,Fantastic restaurant. Service was great. Food was excellent. Their happy hour from 3-7 is great. 3.00 entrees.  Everything from a 1/2 pound burger to margherita flat bread pizza is just 3.00.   Amazing appetizer is the shrimp and eggplant in black peppercorn sauce.
4,"You get a lot of food thats what I love! The guy was very very helpful although you know sometimes you just want a minute to think, that was noexisitant. The chicken is realld good, the ribs were better than okay, but not great. The beef was kinda salty. All in all though great bang for your buck!"
5,"Weve take our daughter to Dr. Ramirez at TLC since we were released from the hospital.  Ive seen all but one of the four doctors, and have been extremely pleased with all of them.  They offer both a sick and well child waiting room.  Our daughter loves the themed rooms.  With small children, you will have the inevitable emergencies that require a doctors visit.  My child is two now, and we have never been unable to get an emergency/sick appointment.  Our phone calls have always been promptly returned on the same day.  Anything they told us they were doing, was done as promised.  I cannot recommend them highly enough!"
4,"I recently picked up a few satin flower arrangements for a fund raiser event.  In spite of having bought a coupon deal for the store, the owner Rachel was more than willing to give me the best possible pricing and pieces.  The arrangements were beautiful and she even custom made a couple of them for us. The colors and flowers she uses are very well picked and beautifully arranged.  I highly recommend Flora Unique."
4,"not only do they have great sandwiches, they have one of the greatest sandwiches ever to appear on a menu: grilled peanut butter and jelly. bison witches (which, if you say it right, it sounds like buy sandwiches) is a great spot to meet friends for a casual lunch.  its right in the heart of downtown tempe off mill and is also a great spot to watch ASU football home games. i believe the owners also own quintons in iowa city, iowa. http://www.yelp.com/biz/quintons-bar-and-deli-iowa-city"
3,"Sure the place has atmosphere and a good drink menu, but I prioritize the eats.  We went on a Monday night for a friends birthday with a semi-large group and they did a prixe-fix menu. I left hungry after paying more than the meal deserved.  The bad: Shumai was just ok, duck mint salad had an unharmonious flavor and I refused to eat it, chicken with wasabi sauce was dried out, lychee wrapped bacon was soggy and a strange proportion, cream and goat cheese dessert with peach was not fun.  The good: the Hong Kong rice noodles and fried tofu with pinapple sauce were the highlights and only things I would eat again. They were really tasty. But I wont be eating them again, because I dont plan to go back.  Im sure theres some gems here, as we found a few, but I need a better batting average and, oh, I dunno, to leave full with a few bucks left in my wallet?"
4,"I love osso bucco, they have really good mexi-style osso bucco, so I love them.  I prefer to sit on the patio or in the bar.  But keep in mind, parking sucks if you go on a busy night."
3,"I do not see why people are so quick to judge an IHOP so harshly. Its an IHOP for Petes sake. The service is ok for being a chain breakfast place. But it is nice that this location is 24hours because my friends and I need a place to eat whether it be after bar hopping hours or not. The food is consistantly not too bad (again for a chain) and Ive gone back several times. Besides, it is great for people watching at certain hours of the day/night! :)"
2,"Service was great, food was ok, restaurant was clean, but the price was more than its worth."
3,"The hubs and I stroll through the indoor market when we are down at the farmers market on the weekends.  They seem to have a good assortment of items, though the prices are quite high.  But Im willing to give them the benefit of the doubt because they are a local business.   One morning we were at the farmers market and decided to grab something for breakfast - its never a good idea to shop hungry :).  I got in line for coffee while the hubs ordered breakfast.  The coffee is fabulous!  I like my food simple - so when the hubs came back with an egg and cheese I wasnt looking for anything fancy (eggs, cheese, maybe a little butter, salt and pepper on some sort of bread product).  I quickly found out that this was some sort of a hipster egg and cheese. Lettuce on an egg and cheese?  Who does that?  There were also tomatoes, mustard and assorted spices.  Im willing to admit that maybe its just me and my underdeveloped ""simple"" palette.  So if you are a hipster and youre hankering for an egg and cheese - this is your place. Regardless, be sure to get a cup of coffee, its awesome!"
1,"WOW!  I have never been to a place with service this horrible.  I may have caught them on a bad night, but Im not giving them a second chance to find out! I came in with a group of 4.  We stood up front for 5-10 minutes before waving someone down to be seated.  That was a mistake.. As were waiting for a server to take our drink order, we noticed that EVERY single table had empty cups waiting to be refilled, dirty plates that needed bussing, and people with impatient faces.  There was only 1-2 dedicated servers, and they completely ignored us. We stuck around just to see how long it would take before someone took our drink order, it was like being in the Twilight Zone.  After 30 minutes and flagging down 3 employees, we just walked out laughing, no one had even apologized for the wait, Im not sure they even saw us leave!  It was the strangest restaurant experience of my life. What a joke... **EDIT**  To their credit, right after I posted this review, I received a message explaining that the Director of Operations would like to amend the situation, even going so far as to include their cell number.  I admit that I feel strange posting such a negative statement amid all the 4 and 5 star reviews, Im assuming I caught them on a really bad night.  Ill edit this if I ever return to the restaurant, but the fact that someone actually reached out to try to rectify things says something"
4,"I have not liked one bar at all in Scottsdale, AZ. This was the first one! A semblance of a normal crowd. We ended up talking with some weirdo local chick, thought they were trying to do some kind of bizarre swinger plot, and they kicked rocks. Some friendly people in there though, all enjoying a good time singing and dancing. Maybe it was because I was inebriated, but the Karaoke was outstanding. These two chicks really belted it out last night. I had a really good time drinking here with my friend. They sell Heineken 22 oz bottles here. I thought that was pretty cool. My friend said ""Headband is the best"" about this place, I have no idea what the means though."
2,This place wasnt that great for the price.  I spent 15 on 2 mini grilled cheese sliders and a tea (basically bar food over priced) Not much to choose from on the menu plus portion size didnt equal out to what I paid for.   The crowd is very Scottsdale and the staff wasnt that friendly.  Definitely wont go back here again.
5,"I need to stop going here so much, but its hard to stay away."
4,I came here for a Yelp event and had a great time. They have the place somewhat divided into two sections- bar and restaurant. I liked that the patio opens right into the bar so you kind of have an extended bar. The food was really good and the staff rocked. I have been meaning to go back. Ill put that on my to-do list!
4,"I flew out of (and into) this airport for the holidays. The process was painless once inside the airport, but their setup with the roads, ramps, and terminals is so absolutely convoluted. Ive never been to a more confusing airport with regards to traffic. That being said, once inside, it was quick to check-in and get my bags checked. I also was traveling with my puppy who was so warmly welcomed by everyone, staff and otherwise. They had no issue with him being out, unlike other airports. A huge perk is a dog park they have outside Terminal 4 to walk dogs before/after flying. Made me feel a lot less nervous about the 5+ hour trip across the country, and Im sure it made my dachshund a lot happier too!"
4,"You know, Ive read some mixed reviews on this place. I enjoy going here. I think the pricing is reasonable, and I havent had bad service. The food is pretty good (in comparison to other Phoenician Sushi restaurants)."
5,"Ace and fried mushrooms at Caseys. My version of heaven.  The food is good and the beer is even better, but what people really go for is the ambiance. The most awesome potpourri of people. Old, young, but always interesting. Say hi to Thomas the cat for me! Hes chilling with the patrons when ever its not too crowded."
4,"My wife and I came here to see what they had to offer. As we had bought a king size bed frame and bed. However because we can still cancel our order and felt our decision was on the whim as the mattress we originally purchased was on sale from another furniture store. We came here to see what other options we had to choose from. Upon entering I already was prepared for the sales man attack, however we were taken back by how friendly and non pressuring environment we entered in. George the salesman was very informative on the beds, and was trying to gauge what we were looking for. After narrowing down to 3 beds another couple came in, we told him we can attend to them while we continued to drill down. He checked on us a few times and answered a few questions we had, but was not breathing down our necks.  The products: They had a good selection of beds for all prices ranges and were well organized based on color piece on the mattress. The sales were nice as well as the options in the clearance section which seemed very reasonable. In the end we ran to the other furniture store to see the bed we originally purchased which we liked very much and kept our original decision. If we didnt find the bed prior Mattress Firm would have easily won our business and would recommend them to others."
5,Had the pastrami sandwich. It brought me back memories of living in NYC and eating that first pastrami. It was good.  Good food hAs the power of time travel.  This is a great place. Plus the coke is primo. Good mixture. The ice makes it over the top.
2,"Oh, this was not good. Food not tasty. Overpriced not tasty food. If youre going to pay for a crab benedict, it should remotely taste like crab. And not be cold. Too busy, too long of a wait, too hungry to change. Other items tasted at our table did not receive much better feedback. I cant recall what others ate. In fact, there wasnt much worth remembering."
3,"Went to Prado for a birthday celebration and things started off very well - its a beautiful dining room, and the live guitar music is a nice addition. The hostess and maitre d were both friendly and personable. They pour you a glass of sherry on the way to sit down at the table, a lovely touch of authentic Spain. All good so far. However, the food is very hit or miss, as others have suggested. Some dishes really shined (butternut squash soup, bison short rib, pineapple coconut cake) while others really disappointed (one-dimensional gazpacho, chewy calamari, fish overpowered by olive tapenade). My advice: soak in the atmosphere and music at the bar, maybe snack on some tapas, but skip the restaurant unless youre okay with hit-and-miss. Such a shame, too, because I LOVED Chef Urciuolis cuisine when he was at Taggia."
5,"It is almost impossible to find a great sandwich shop that actually has good grinders and sandwiches.  Well my search is over.  I stumbled across this little shop and felt right at home in New England.  Being from Connecticut, I was so excited to see all the great food on the menu.  I had the Vermonter and it was bliss at every bite.  The owners are extremely friendly and you can tell that they want you to be very happy with their food and service.  Great food and great service, you will not be dissapointed...."
5,"Im President of the Local scooter club so I know and deal with most of the dealers Valley Wide. Tylor the GM and team run a good shop. Very friendly. Dont get me wrong, they are there to make money but they are not push. You are free to hang out and ask lots of questions. Good assortment of accessories and they can pretty much get anything. They know bikes and parts inside an out. Service on my Piaggion BV500 has been fast and fantastic. I did not say cheap, but fair.  Actually they had a Buy 1 tire get the 2nd for 1cent event this week. In the past they had a 1/2 price on all their helmets. Got a Scorpion $220 helmet for about $110. Just ask what and when they are having specials. I dont buy the review below about bait and switch, pretty serious accusation. However, GoAZ and Gina over there are good people as well."
5,"This is my current first choice in eateries.  The spring rolls are made with rice paper and such an array of fresh bite sized vegetables, it melts in your mouth, and there are so many different kinds, ave price 3-4.00.  Did I say they are HUGE?  Its a weight watchers dream.  Everything on the menu that we have tried has been delicious and presented beautifully.  The sauces accompanying each dish are always intrigueing and tasty as all get out.  The best thing of all, though, is the Ginger Creme Brule.  Wow, sir.  It doesnt get better than that.  If you like Viet food, Thai food, or just plain fresh, good food, then this Vietnamese restaraunt should pique your interest.  My goal is to try everything on the menu."
4,"Food is good.  Service is pretty good. Its a restaurant that definitely reminds you of LA, as it is very loud in there. Definitely will go back."
5,"I LOVE the pretzels! Wish they would bring back the Asiago Dip, but hey, garlic salt and cabs are 2 of my main food groups. Great atmosphere, can always see a game on one of the many TVs, even when my girlfriend thinks Im paying attention to her! Milk stout is my favorite beer, but the light isnt bad either. Something tells me the others are good too, but its hard to get me to stray from my patterns. Oh well, Ill leave someone else to review those. All in all, the food and beer is great, and the servers seem to know what theyre doing too."
4,"Secreto is under a new owner, but the food hasnt suffered from what I can see in other reviews. We stopped in the grab a late lunch and order the Tortilla Soup and the Roasted Elephant Garlic starters. Both were out of this world. The Tortilla soup was far richer than any Ive had before and extremely flavorful. Dont know how to described the Roasted Elephant Garlic platter, damn good though ... a must have when you eat there. The menu is very tight without a lot of fluff. The beer selection is strictly premium (although the manager said she does stock the ever present BUD LIGHT in bottles if someone is really hankering for one).  The service is great - unrushed for sure. The place has high backed booths that offer a bit of privacy. Nice intimate restaurant. Definitely a repeat"
3,"After reading Lindseys review, I had to think twice about my original review of this place. Yes, I had been back and gave it another shot. Yes, perhaps, I was a bit douchy in my prior review.  This place is definitely a great spot if you need a quick lunch, and you are on the go. Its a fairly comfortable place to eat, and its better for you than a Baconator (although, that does sound delicious right about now). They tend to water down their Sriracha, but it might be more of a heat thing rather than a cost cutting thing. Sriracha can be a bit spicy for some. The spicy chicken bowl is the way to go. Try it. Dont listen to my old review. I was probably having a bad day at work."
5,"The food was flavorful and plenty of it. Eating with only your fingers is quite fun - make your momma proud. My girlfriend won the best dish of the night - lentils and chicken and cabage/carrots. It all had kind of sweetish/bitterish/spicy flavor. I had the lamb and jalapeño dish, which was kind of greasy. You eat with your fingers and can scoop up the food with the bread they give you - a tartish type crepe, which goes well with the food. Id be happy to go back and try something different.  If you are used to frozen pizzas and Burger King, you might want to stick with that as this experience might bit be as enjoyable as those who are more open to what they consume."
2,"The service was very slow. People at several tables were waiting, far to long for, drinks checks food. The table had no bread plate , no salt and pepper. No napkins.  We had to ask for everything. The busser did not seem to understand how to set a table. We ordered the beet salad, it had no flavor and huge -hard as a rock  beets, no cheese. Tiny orange wedges.  No good.  I ordered, for a main dish the Covina, white fish. It was so salty I had to send it back. The waitress then informed me that I ordered it wrong! Last time I checked you made sure your food tasted good and wasnt toxic with salt. She informed me that it was served blackened, blackened does not mean coated in disgusting salt. My hubby ordered capellini. The shrimp were undercooked and not fresh. There was very little tomato sauce. It was bland greasy and void of any redeeming qualities. Again , like the beet salad, the veggies were not prepared correctly ...... huge lumps of tomatoes, , mix yourself?  How do you serve pasta with no sauce ? Overall I would say the chef is not talented. No one bothers to prep properly, no one is tasting the plates as they are so bad it is impossible to believe the menu is being checked and corrected. In the meantime to go back for a glass of wine and an appetizer may happen as there is some potential , just a glimmer ....and , in a few months, if enough people review, and finally .....if the owner is smart enough to stop this unfortunate cascade . The patio is pleasant, I hope someone cares enough."
5,"This is my FAVORITE place to dine out in the greater Phoenix area. The food (I recommend the steaks) is almost as good as the view and the service is impeccable. My boyfriend took me here on a date a year ago, and it was definitely one of the most romantic restaurants we have found in Phoenix yet.  The prices are a little high ($25 - $40 per entree), but its well worth it and you wont leave disappointed. If you like American or French food (who doesnt?) and have a special occasion or just feel like doing something different, I highly recommend Different Pointe of View to everyone!"
4,"Great place to have a meal with family, can be a little on the loud side cause ita always a busy place, recomend calling ahead and getting name put on waiting list, reservations party of six or more only price range moderate, but well worth it"
2,"I prefer Petsmart better because they have a better selection and prices. I like Petco for their cookie bar so I can pick up some cookies that are friendly for pets for my pets. Thats basically it, I only shop here on occasion because of the location. Go to Pets Inc in Tempe instead for a real shopping experience."
2,Its cute. Its homey. However... You close at 6pm on a Wednesday night  + You were going to charge me 50 cents to process my debit card = I left with one drink and wont be back Too bad too since my best friend lives around the corner. We would have lived here ...
5,Food was really good. Waitstaff were all really friendly and helpful in selecting drinks and entree. Would for sure go back.
5,This place is delicious. Great food and when they cook in front of you they do a lot of cool tricks and stuff. I would eat there everyday if I could afford it.
5,I came here today for a manicure and pedicure... I have been here quite a few times; it is a place my girlfriends like to come to so when I want to hang with my girlfriends and get a mani/pedi this is where we meet.  Although today I was solo:(.  The ladies here do a really good job; my manicures always last a really long time and they are really nice and accommodating.  Today I had one girl doing my pedicure and another doing my manicure... now that is what I call service!  I was out of there in a hour.  They do not have a tip line on credit or debit so bring cash for the tip.  Today I did not have cash ( i forgot)  they were so nice they said next time I come I can tip then if I want.  I came back anyway to tip them because it was so fast and my nails look great.  Oh another thing I forgot to mention is they use the hot rocks for the massage part for both the manicure and the pedicure and the callous remover is part of the cost of the pedicure.  Total for both services including getting french manicure on toes and fingers was $42.00.
2,"Okay, this place has received a ton of slack from prior reviews. I am not a huge fan of the food nor the 1950s style decor, but the people are nice and I have been more than satisfied with the spinach queso dip. I actually do get a craving for it which draws me every few months to that bright turquoise and black decor.  The lunch menu is very reasonable and the lunch portion of the pollo magnifico was good! What this place lacks in food, is made up in quick, fairly friendly service, and an area that is convenient to downtown Scottsdale and the Giants Spring training stadium. I like the breezy patio area but the big black birds that stalk the fallen corn chips under your chair are a bit frightening. But after a game this March, I am actually looking forward to spinach dip and margarita at Julio Gs."
3,"Decent Chinese food. I go often for take out. It is easy and convenient for those in central phoenix. I have had times where some of the food is great and other times it was bad. Support local restaurants, this beats panda express!"
4,"I think it was the guitar playing chicken that caught my eye as I drove by.  Then it was the ""Now Open"" sign.  New business?  Figured I had to try it. Rock-n-Roll Fingers is a SO cool concept.  Chicken fingers, waffle fries and Texas toast - thats pretty much the menu.  The Chicken fingers may be fried or Buffalo style - but they definitely wont be from frozen chicken.  They use only fresh Chicken breasts - no skin and no bones -  and they fry only in Canola oil to make for the least unhealthy fried chicken they can.  They have about 7 different dipping sauces - from Ranch to Thai sweet chili  - though they are known for their Special Sauce.  Its a secret recipe, so of course I had to try it.  Pretty dang good.  I also loved the BBQ which was more tangy than sweet and went perfect with the chicken.   As for the chicken - have you ever had chicken so juicy that you though it might not be fully cooked?  Maybe its just because I grew up eating overcooked food, but every once in awhile when I get chicken cooked so perfectly I have to look to make sure it isnt pink.  It was SO juicy I was really shocked.  And though fried, it wasnt a thick and overly crispy batter - just enough to seal in the juices while leaving you with a tender and flexible piece of meat.  The waffle fries were out of this world.  The Texas toast was SOOO good!   When I got back to the office I was super excited to learn two things.  This is an independently owned business - this is their first location.  And even more cool - they have gotten a perfect score by the Health Department more than six times in a row.  Wow.    So you can eat some really great food and support a new local business for a $5-7 lunch.  Not bad.  Not bad at all."
4,Went back for a 2nd go-round.  This time I got the B&G also.  It really was fantastic.  The gravy was about as perfect as can be with one exception - there werent any sausage chunks.   I opted for the country potatoes which I did not like at all - they were WAY too onion-y.  The hash browns are great. This place gets high marks for the service - the owners are very friendly and welcoming.
5,"Fantastic meal.     Fantastic experience.      I am a vegetarian.    I cook a lot and am very conscious of food preparation, starting with sourcing.    I dont just patronize Farmers Markets, I patronize CERTAIN Farmers Markets....that sort of thing.    Long story short, if I am going to dine out, I want something very special.  VERY special.  Quiessence exceeded my expectations at almost every turn.    I dined there with my son and daughter-in-law...both truly expert cooks...more knowledgeable than I.      All of us were BLOWN AWAY by our meal.    We got the Farmers Feast without the wine pairings so we could choose our own wine.     I got the vegetarian...they got the carnivore (or ominvore or whatever they call it!).     Truthfully, labels are irrelevant.      Its all in the taste...and the tastes are sublime! I was impressed by how much variety was in each plate.      Theirs were similar but each a little different.      More importantly, there was a marvelous progression of very carefully crafted flavors.       The most impressive thing:   The chef clearly wanted to offer his own interpretations .     That he did so while letting the fabulous ingredients speak for themselves is truly remarkable. The setting is beautiful.     The servers are unpretentiously proud of their community and the work they are doing and seemed to enjoy our enjoyment as well. Our only criticism (and it is minor)  is that although the desserts were beautifully crafted, we felt that they did not reflect the intentions of local sustainability.    There is so much wonderful local fruit (used in other courses, I might add!)...perhaps adding some to the desserts would carry out the theme more completely...Im sure the chefs creativity can conjure more ideas than I! That said, I will return!    As often as possible!    Quiessence and the Farm at South Mountain are an unparalleled resource for the Phoenix community...easy to get to from any part of the Valley...no excuses, folks!...Go!"
1,"My husband and I have Been meaning to go in here and see if it was anything like hong kong gourmet, so yesterday for lunch we decided to give it a try. Huge mistake! The food was literally inedible, everything was either too cold or burnt to a char, nothing tasted good. We decided to try the desert and the cream puff (Im unsure how you can mess that up) was petrified and the cream was so gross I spit it out. The smell of the flan actually made us gag, we had such an awful time I complained to the manager. She didnt even seem to care, and gave us 20% off of a lunch we didnt even eat. We were disgusted by this place, and we will never, ever go back. Dont do it, you will regret it!"
5,"LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE!  always need to find a reason to drive so far to Chandler:-)  so fresh, soup delish, and sauces yummy!!! BYOB, and casual...feels like my grandmas:-)"
4,"Hubby and I were here tonight for a grand and glorious breaking of his diet. He had been before to the one in Houston, and had been looking forward to the new Scottsdale location. For being open only 3 nights, the service went quite smoothly and the staff and management we met were all great. We started out with drinks- a gin and tonic ($10) and a caipirinha ($8.25)- both were strong and very good. The wine list is extensive, for those who prefer the vino. Delicious little popovers arrived at the table, and we headed off to the salad bar. Far better and fresher than Fogo E Brasas, it had a variety of cheeses (including chunks of parm and fresh mozzarella), smoked salmon, prosciutto, salami, sun dried tomatoes, olives, marinated bell peppers, asparagus spears, mushroom caps, and seafood and chicken salads, just to name about a third of the offerings. Then came a veritable torrent of meat. The beef was the best, and came in a variety of cuts and preparations. We liked the Ancho (rib eye), the Picanha (the classic sirloin cut in the half moon shape), and the garlic beef best. The pork ribs were really well done and juicy, and the sausage was quite flavorful. The chicken was a tad dry, and the lamb was too gamey for our liking (and we usually like lamb).  Side dishes were brought to our table, in appropriately modest portions. There were squares of polenta, which I really liked but Hubby did not care for, and mildly garlic mashed potatoes, and yummy fried plantains.  Dessert choices were pretty typical: a creme brulee, a flan, 2 types of cheesecake, and 2 types of chocolate cake. Hubby wanted what he had enjoyed at the Houston Fogo before: the papaya cream topped with creme de cassis liqueur ($8.25). It was more runny than mousse-y, and the papaya taste was pretty subtle, with the liqueur being the top note. There is a rather unnecessary valet parking service for $3, when the parking lot surrounding the place is huge. Not so huge, however,  that the many douche-bags who double parked went unnoticed. The bathrooms are nice. The dinner, which is all you care to eat, is $42.50 per person. Im sure well be back for special occasions."
3,"I enjoy ""the BOP"" as my friend calls it on the same level that I enjoy pizza.  Its good, but its not my desert island bar.  I go here to meet up with friends.  Ive never been there on my own because lets face it.  Im not likely to be caught dead trolling Scottsdale (even non-Scottsdale Scottsdale) by my lonesome.  The atmosphere is cozy and inviting.  Which kinda turns me off. I like my bars a bit seedier.  But if thats your thing then Im cool with it.  I hear the food is pretty good for English fare, but hey who wants to waste time eating when you could be drinking?"
5,Very Hip Hotel and Comfortable ~ Amazing location ~Great Staff all is good at the Valley HO !!!
5,"Covet is an excellent clothing store. In Arizona, there is almost nowhere decent to shop.  unless of course you loooooove Juicy Couture, in the event of which, you should probably not even bother reading this review, because this kind of fashion forward clothing wont appeal to you.  Acne Jeans? check. Endovenera? check. Ksubi? check.  Nike? check.  Covet starts off with an excellent mens shoe section,  continues with an excellent mens clothing selection,  and finishes off with excellent womens wear.  It really is a shame if you havent been to Covet yet. Do yourself a  serious favor and support a small business at the same time."
4,"Planet Sub is definitely a good option for solid, good tasting subs. Im next door at Gangplank a couple times a week and we usually hit this place up for lunch. Its much better than the last place that was in this spot, has tons of options (we decided you could eat lunch there for a month and not have the same sandwich), and friendly staff. Im definitely glad they put this in. Its a great option in the downtown Chandler area."
4,"I was sworn to secrecy when we first came here with friends several years ago.  I think its some of the best Italian in town.  It isnt fancy (a plus, in my book).  Its small, so sometimes there can be a wait involved. Even though its small, because of the very personal service by the owner, the service can be lacking or distracted.  The food, however, is well worth it!   I try to get something new each time I go, and Ive never been disappointed."
4,"Stop by today for California Burger and I also their chocolate brownie delight sundae.  It is probably one of the best sundaes I have ever had.  If you are a chocolate fan, this place is definitely something that you will want to try. The help is friendly and helpful."
4,"Always clean and accommodating to any workout schedule.  I work near by so it is very convenient to go at lunch. Great amenities, even a pool, and classes.  Wish there were a few more yoga classes or classes geared to those of us that are out of shape/beginners, but Ill get there."
3,"We have some friend who were RAVING about this place, so we popped in for a sandwich before a movie recently.  I gotta say, I had a great reuben sandwich that I was VERY pleased with.  Im not sure if I will be venturing to the area just to have this sandwich again, but it was super tasty.  Everyone seemed to like what they had and the menu has something for everyone.  If Im in the area again, I might venture here, but I am partial to Jimmy Johns (next door) so it might be hard to choose."
3,"This place is pretty good for a chain, and its very easy to find something for everyone here. The staff has always been friendly, and the menu is huge! The food is just okay though. Would return with friends or for convenience, but we would not go on our own."
1,"Really, if I could, I would give this place zero stars, because it is a disgrace. If you need an emergency vet in the Scottsdale/Paradise Valley area, go to Sonora Veterinary Specialists on Cactus/40th St.(http://www.sonoraveterinaryspecialists.com/). Its also 24/7, but unlike VCA PVEAH, it is a truly valuable, legitimate facility, and its staffed by engaged, committed, deeply caring, and extremely knowledgeable and skilled personnel. At SVS, you and your pet are treated well and what you pay is fair and justified. VCA is the opposite of SVS in every single way. VCA is, in fact, the WORST of corporate animal service providers. The space is small, cheap, cramped, and the staff are indifferent at best and dont convey any genuine love of or concern about animals in pain or distress. All they want is your money. They do NOTHING for the $99.75 they charge for an ""emergency exam."" We essentially paid that amount just to be given an astronomical estimate, literally nothing more--our dog was the exact same bloody, traumatized mess we gave to them when they gave him back--after making us wait nearly an hour without ANY communication).  Furthermore, they tack on bogus surcharges ($5.25 for a ""biohazard waste fee"") that are irrelevant to the ""service"" provided, and their drug prices are absurd--$8 for a single Tramadol tablet, anyone? Conversely, our (and our dogs) experience at Sonora Veterinary Specialists was wonderful (even in the context of an emergency), and the cost was ultimately significantly less. VCA is a money-grubbing, depressing, sham."
4,"Phoenix Muni is a great stadium to see Oakland As Spring Training Games. Yes, its older than many of the other Arizona stadiums, but it has a simple charm that serves it wall. Great seats can be found just about anywhere in the park, and for $22 we were in row 7, just to the right of home plate. Its also pretty easy getting in and out of both the stadium and the parking lot. The only (minor) negative is probably common to most stadiums: there dont seem to be enough vendors (at least beer vendors; several people around us mentioned it), and the concession stands can get somewhat backed up at times. But for a relaxing place to watch baseball in the Arizona sun, its hard to beat Phoenix Municipal Stadium."
4,"If you can look past the giant Meth billboard right outside and the general uncleanliness of the entire establishment, its pretty wonderful... especially if your intentions involve eating a whole lobster, like myself. Gourmet House of Hong Kong has the cheapest whole lobster dishes Ive ever found, anywhere. I dont mean a measly, mid-western, tourist trap restaurant kind of lobster, I mean a damn good, meaty, savory, juicy morsel of deliciousness. Its served a number of ways, but I usually go for the black bean sauce style. Then, I eat like nobodys watching, vow to never let my boyfriend see me like this, and usually end up getting sauce on my face, clothing, table, neighbors, etc. Go messy, or go home."
1,"I took my kitty to the Beat the Heat low cost spay event and she came home with a hematoma in her ear that was NOT there when I took her there in the morning. Surprise, surprise...they can recommend a vet to take her to. Im pretty mad about this."
4,"Four days and maybe seven hours ago, our hunger brought us forth to eat cheesesteak, to try a new restaurant, conceived in Philly, but dedicated to the proposition that not all cheesesteaks are created equal. We shared a large chicken cheesesteak with everything (onions, bell peppers), and cheese wiz, along with some sweet potato fries. The chicken cheesesteak came with a good amount of tender chicken, with a lot of flavor.  There is a free-range mini fridge that is stocked with sweet , hot peppers, and fry sauce which is nice so you can customize your order with as many or as little peppers as you want.  While the ingredients were good quality, the cheesesteak as a whole naturally doesnt really compare to any Ive had in Philly, but its good for Arizona! The sweet potato fries were my favorite part of the meal.  They tasted freshly cut, and were excellently cooked with just the right amount of crunch while still tender and sweet inside. So would our forefathers be impressed by Forefathers?  They probably wouldnt know what a cheesesteak would be, but if they tasted one, I would say they would be!"
5,"I love happy hour!  3PM to 6PM EVERYDAY! This place has one of, if not, THE BEST!!! $4 Grilled Chicken Quesadillas, YES!!  Plus $4 or $5 for a mile high pile of Green Chile  Chicken Nachos?  YES!!!  And if you really want a treat...$9 for 3 huge fillet Mignon Tacos.  Plus COLD BEER both bottle and tap plus reasonable mixed drink prices.  Place is friendly, bar plays classic rock, most patrons seem to be regulars...once you eat there, you will be too!  Friendly staff especially Hostess Judith and the young man with the red hair.  Ive been in the restaurant  related business for 30 years, the prime phrase is CONSISTANCY and the food, atmosphere and friendly people are always consistant.  Consistantly great.  The owner, Andrew, always makes a point to great everybody.  New Orleans Bartender exudes Southern Hospitality.  Regular Menu is a bit pricey, portions could be larger, but food is great."
4,"Yucca is a great neighborhood library, if I may say so.  Its not huge, but you can place holds on anything from any Phoenix library, get on the internet, read the paper, and any number of other things."
4,"Go for the 5 star food and setting, but be warned about the 3 star service.   The menu lived up to all the high reviews posted by others.  Every dish was inventive and well done.  The salads were particularly noteworthy with the interesting and tasty use of local ingredients.   The service was odd.  They were attentive, but amateurish.  It started with a request for a wine recommendation. The wine menu is heavy on Arizona wines, which we dont know anything about.  I dont think our waiter knew much more than us, and the wine he recommended was barely drinkable.  Next we asked a question about the tasting menu.  The answer took some time because, we were told, the waiter wasnt allowed to ask the chef directly and had to relay the question through an ""expeditor."" There were a lot of people helping us, but it was actually too much - it was distracting to have so many different people - and none of them seemed very well trained.  For example, we got our entree and asked about the purée on one plate.  Our waiter first guessed celery, and then said it might be cauliflower, and then someone else overheard the discussion and clarified that it was actually potato."
3,"Pretty good mexican grub in the 480. I had two carne asada tacos and a chile rellano plate. The meat in the tacos was tender, tasty and plentiful, accompanied by chilantro, onion and hot sauce - typical ingredients but done right. The chile rellano had a flavorful red sauce, the batter was not too soggy, the chile was cooked well (not crunchy/underdone, not squishy/overcooked) and the cheese oozed out when the chile was cut into.  This dish came with the standard rice and beans, neither of which was remarkable in any way shape or form. Minus two big stars for what they consider guacamole.  It wasnt thick, it had no taste and it seemed as though this vital mexican staple was merely there as a garnish.  No bueno.  If it aint green, thick and tasty, you better hit the drawing board. Ya feel me?"
5,"Elmer, I love you. I have since I was a senior at Chandler High. Back then I was broke so I could only get a bean burrito and strips...and they were dang good.  If anyone wants to complain about strips just being chips and cheese they can suck it. Now days I am a little less broke so I always get the green chili burro. And it is always so good. Spicy enough to burn a little and the tortilla is always fresh...thanks man. And bless your little Mexican Heart, you serve corn dogs...so I can even come here with my crazy picky kids.  I love you Elmer. I always will."
5,"I started working with Second Chance FitCenter in the spring of this year.  I went because I wanted to feel stronger, especially in my core.  I run and am a generally active dude, but wanted something more out of my physical body.  I had never done any type of ""personal training"" so I was a little apprehensive....and... I have REALLY enjoyed working with Heat - she is a great teacher, which if personal training is anything it is a psychologist/mentor/butt kicker/saint...so in my book that is a great teacher!!   Case in point: A few weeks ago I mentioned that I was not sure if I was improving - mostly just my own mind being negative.  So Heat said, ""Next time we will try the very first workout we did.  Cool?""  I was game.  Dude!  I blew through that sucker - to the point were I was like ""this is cake""...of course on the second and third time through the sets  (and I think fourth on this day...) it got harder and harder...and I totally kept up.  It was awesome.  I loved it.  My Checklist:   Sense of accomplishment (check) Strength building (check) Piece of mind, knowing I am taking care of myself (check) Good teaching and patience (check) In short, I love my time at Second Chance."
5,"My wife called to have our vent cleaned since our dryer was taking over an hour to dry an average load. Our appointment was scheduled for 8 a.m. not for 8-12 as most places. He showed up at 8 and had the vent clean and working well. Excellent customer service and very friendly. Thanks again, Gary"
4,"Stopped by for a beer and a snack.  Temp was around 70 so we sat outside. My amber ale from Breckenridge was good, and my wife ordered the cheaper of their Pinot Noirs and it was also good.  Waiter was friendly and genuine. I like their anti pasti menu.  You can pick and choose what you want.  We tried the 12-hour roasted tomatoes, olives, some almonds, manchego cheese, and sopresseta.  It was all good. We are eager to go back and eat dinner - the menu looked appetizing."
5,"theres a gun check upon entry. i often forget AZ is quite different than CA.... my first and only experience at cabelas was on black friday. i honestly havent participated in black friday much in past yrs and questioned deals really being deals. but HELLO deals at cabelas. first of all, they gave away rifles to the first 800 people we were there on black friday. again, im not in cali anymore! this place is an outdoors lover dream. and on top of selection and discounted prices...its almost like an amusement park:  aquarium room with freshwater fish, back natural history museum-eque taxidermy displays, heads of animals and maps of where they originate from hanging throughout the huge main room, a chocolate shop, and entire cafeteria.  basically, you can make a day out of cabelas. we were there for 4 hours and i didnt even realize. but now lets talk about the deals....the deeeeaaallssss. ""i could easily spend $1,000 in one trip here."" - my guy, as we finally left the building. a stranger chuckled who overheard, ""yeah, no kidding."" the damage on my credit card was...

1,"The staff is friendly. But the physical hotel itself itself is comparable to a 2 star motel. The Holiday Express I stayed at is better than this. Priceline tricked me when I requested for a 4 star and indicated that this was a 4 star in name your own price. Cons: 1) They have cactus in the parking lot where when I got home late, it was dark, poorly lit lot, and opened my car door, step out of the car, and step on to cactus severely injuring my foot to where I can not walk anymore. Who puts low cactus in a dimly lit parking lot where when you get out of a car, someone can step on it? Being injured on vacation is no fun and very painful! 2) hotel room and property is old, like from the 1980s though the front desk boy told me that the rooms were newly renovated 3) Given the previous reviews I asked for a quiet room, but was given a room where the squeeking and thumping and wall shaking, woke me up at 5 in the morning. The neighbors flushing the toilet, showering, and running water can all be heard. 4) the bathroom door is so jammed that it requires both hands, all of my body wait and a few minutes of wrestling with it to open/close it 5) Requested a single bed, however upon arrival, was told that it would be 30/extra a night for a single bed instead of 2 doubles 6) 80s style tube TV  7) pink 80s decor 8) worn down bed with body dent in it 9) wifi costs 9.99/for 24 hours even though its signal is only 1 bar 10) AC blasts loudly on and off during the night 11) curtains are cut half way so tons of light comes in to the room in the morning.  pros:  1) location 2) staff smiles and says hi 3) cleaning staff does a good job"
5,"Im not one for hyperbole, but this may have been THE  BEST      MEAL      OF   MY       LIFE!!!! Id like to hold an awards show and give out lifetime achievement trophies to the following individuals: 1.  To the chef, who exceeded my expectations again and again. The Stetson salad, wild boar meatballs, and Korean-style BBQ short ribs (and that killer side of au-gratin brussel sprouts) and you, sir, have won my heart and my stomach.  I want to fill a swimming pool with that BBQ sauce! 2.  To our server, Richard.  Your genuine excitement for the food was a nice change from past servers reluctant to give a real recommendation.  You were cordial and professional and made sure we enjoyed our time with you.  I dont know, I may name my unborn child after you in tribute. 3.  To the pastry chef, Country.  Your bread pudding was exceptional, but what a surprise, your ice creams were downright dreamy!  The scoop of brown butter ice cream took my tastebuds on a field trip through chilled fields of chocolate truffles. Thank you thank you for a wonderful birthday dinner!"
1,"The food was decent, however I am writing about their underhanded business practices. I ordered a travelzoo voucher for $69 that included 2 3 course meals. It said ""Regularly $140"". What we ordered, if had been ordered off the regular menu would have been about $100. However, we were charged tax on the full $140.  Second, even though on the voucher it says ""PLEASE TIP ON THE FULL VALUE OF THE CHECK."" (which implies tip is not included and we get to choose the tip amount) and nowhere mentions automatic gratuity, 18% gratuity (18% of $140, even though we ordered $100 worth of food at the most) was automatically added to our check. Third, even if you had ordered the most expensive options, the highest possible amount it could be worth is $120, not $140. It is mathematically impossible to have the voucher be a $140 value, but that is what they add tax and tip to. Fourth, after we told our waiter we were using a voucher, he seemed less interested in the service level of our table, which i later realized was because he had a guaranteed 18% (of $140) tip. I just noticed today they have another travelzoo deal ""$79 - AWARD-WINNING FRENCH DINNER FOR 2 W/WINE, REG. $165"", I am posting this so hopefully if anyone is thinking of buying that voucher, they will read this first before they purchase it."
5,Love chickafila :) theyre pretty pricey for fast food though
3,"My husband and I ate here for lunch as we were waiting for our room to be ready (we were checking in early).  The restaurant is very inviting and I liked the decor.  We had a great window seat the overlooked the outdoor terrace and the mountains in the background was lovely!    The hostess was very friends and our waiter was attentive and fairly personable.   I ordered the Beet & Goat Cheese salad with Grilled Chicken and it was quite good!  Even though I liked it very much, I would only give it a 3 out of 5 because they didnt use Roasted Beets...I believe that they were canned beets.   Still good, but roasted beets would have knocked it out of the park!  The salad had spinach, mild goat cheese, mandarin oranges, red onion, and delicious candied pecans....with a balsamic vinaigrette.  It was a very good salad.  I wished I had ordered the small serving though because it was a large salad!  The  My Husband ordered the Grilled Chicken Sandwich with fries.  The fries were SO good!  The sandwich was equally good, but spicy from the roasted pablano that was on it. Net-net....it was a very good lunch, but I can only give it 3 stars because it cost us $40 for a salad, a sandwich, a soda (I had water),and gratuity.  For $40.00 for lunch, it should have been outstanding, not just very good.  I get that its in a resort, but still."
4,This store is 2 miles from my house so I am there all the time. I find their customer service has been consistently good. Even on Black Friday at 7am the sales help has been very pleasant and very helpful.
5,"Alright we are going to say that this place is Awesome!  The service is outstanding and the food wonderful!    We came here for Breakfast on Sunday Morning .             They were very busy ,but, we did not have to wait too long at all.                                    Our server Colleen was great!   She greeted us right away and  brought our drinks very quickly.   The food was very good and just love their Potatoes.  The menu is fantastic! Lots to choose from. We like the decor and lots of parking in the lot. Nice Place and we will be back!"
4,"Great place for dinner!  We had an early seating (5:30 on a Saturday night) so the restaurant was pretty empty when we got there.  As a result, service was very attentive.  We ordered a little bit of everything off their different headings.  We got the mushroom rice pot, the pork belly, chefs sashami, sweet corn skewers, chicken yakitori, one of the grilled entrees and dessert.  Everything was fantastic with the exception of the grilled corn.  It was SOOOO salty that it was inedible.  I mentioned it to our server and he just brushed it off - didnt offer to not charge me for it or bring me something else.  But because the rest of the meal was pretty good, Im still giving it 4 stars."
4,"While we were finishing up at Forefathers, I checked my mobile Yelp app to see what else was in the area.  Zoyo popped up and the reviews were good so I asked my daughter if she wanted dessert.  Silly me, of course she said yes! It was a short drive to Zoyo.  I passed it the first time cause my GPS said it was on my right but nooooo it was on the left.  We made a quick u-turn and there we were.   It was clean and well lit and nicely laid out.  If I remember correctly there were either 10 or 12 different flavors.  I had Red Velvet and Banana.  YUM!  The Red Velvet was delish!  My daughter had RV and Cake Batter.  They had all the standard toppings and the topping area as well as the yougurt area was very clean.  The young people (oh god I sound old!) that were tending to the counter were pretty efficient and friendly.  There was pleanty of seating too.  Some nice larger, round tables and then what looked like a hallway had some smaller tables for two.  There were also tables outside.  It was a Saturday night and there seemed to be a steady stream of people coming in while we were there.  Some stayed, some got theirs to go.  They also had two flat screen tvs on the wall .  One was playing The Bee Movie and the other had Soccer.  Overall our experience here was a good one and we will be back.  I may even bump it up to 5 stars after I try more flavors.  Although if they always have Red Velvet......but then again its good to try new things.  Thank you Zoyo!"
5,Love it here. Come regularly now lol thanks to everyone on yelp. Great food cheap price great service. Tho not 100 percent authentic Chinese food still great
5,"I can only add my gushing praise to the other reviews.  Not only is the food outstanding (pork osso bucco, green chile stew and pecan/fig pie), but the ambiance and service really help make this place a standout.  So many places have arrogant, stuffy service, so Scottsdale.  Not so here.  Also, the waitstaff had opinions about the food - which dishes are his favorite and why.  Elegant but comfortable atmosphere, reasonable prices, and a real enthusiasm from the staff (and a chef, who came to visit with folks that he knew who were sitting near us).  The food is rich, but did not seem unhealthily so - not bathed in salt and heavy cream sauce.  Perfect portion size, with a balance - meat, grains and veggies.  So happy that Becketts is in the neighborhood! (Oh - and no valet!  I  hate valet parking when there is an ample adjacent parking lot, and spots are only limited because the valets put their cones in the available spots.)"
1,"La Grande Orange Grocery has a problem. It cant decide what it wants to be when it grows up, and that makes the overall experience iffy. Is it a quick mart? A grocery store? A restaurant? A coffee shop? Unfortunately, it cant be all of them. I love La Grande Orange Pizzeria, when there is table service, fun wait-staff, and delicious food. But during the day on the weekends, the Grocery is too busy and unorganized to tolerate. It is not set up for the crowd, they do a poor job of line management, and when there is a line to order, the rest of the Grocery is impossible to navigate. To top it off, the counter staff shouts at you when your food is ready. Unnecessary. Ill certainly be back at night for the pizza, the delicious wings, and to partake of the best gelato shop adjacent to LGO. But Im afraid that I wont be back for the weekend chaos."
5,"This review is directly for Joe that works at this specific location. From the first time I entered the store with my boyfriend, I cant explain how much of a help Joe has been. Not only is he knowledgeable about every product in the store, his warm character makes it an absolute pleasure to shop there. If it were up to me.... Joe would be a regional manager!"
4,"OK, not knowing what to expect when walking up to the RC when I saw a courtyard full of people mulling around, I thought a relaxed, quiet meal was shot to hell! Lucky for us, all the peeps walking around (seeming ""Zombie-like"") were waiting on Pizzeria Bianco, the Pizza place across the way!  OK Back to the review of RC.. I have to agree with Francis L.. Good sliders, fish was below average BUT the Wedge Fries are awesome!! The fish itself was OK, but the breading was watery as if steamed from the inside! I was totally bummed because It had a good flavor.. but was inedible! The Tartar sauce was another huge hit! not a creamy sauce but liquidy with tons of Cucumber chunks... The Onion Rings are worth a try.. and they have a nice Horseradish- ranch sauce. We sat inside, nice decor... you gotta like the English Pub look which is fine by me! Well be back for sure!! Nutshell- Nice Bar menu, good bar food- GREAT drinks!! Great people watching spots from front porch area... Defiantly worth repeat visits!"
4,Check engine light came on in Wikieup late on Friday night.  One of my family members has had work done here before and recommended them.  They got me in on short notice and stayed late to finish the job.  Was reasonably priced too.
5,"They get five stars now. You know why? Three little words I long to hear: Gluten-Free Buns! (OK, technically thats two words, but I love them nonetheless!) The buns are a dollar extra, but if you are like me and are tired of eating a burger with a lettuce wrap, or worse, with cutlery, just for the illusion of a sense of normalcy, they are worth it. And, frankly, quite tasty. I dont know if all RR are serving them now, or from the same bakeries/distributors, but I for one am glad for it!"
1,Last night on my way home from work I figured I would pick up some dinner for me and my wife who is taking care of our newborn all day and has little time to cook for us. I ordered chicken limone the menu says serves two to three and we dont eat a lot so I figured it would fill us up. The price was 18.99 but I figured in a family style Italian place and we should have plenty of food.  I was handed my bag and I was sure it was the wrong order because it was so light so I checked it in the car and was shocked.  I see three small pieces of chicken in a big container with a small piece of bread and thats it!  So I figured they just forgot the pasta and went back in and asked the hostess and she said yes it comes with it then said no after thinking about it.  So how can they justify that price? It was so small there was no way it would feed 2 people so I had to cook pasta at home and then reheat our chicken in the microwave. I worked in the service industry for years and this place is a joke!  FYI just because theres people with money who live near your restaurant doesnt mean you can tailor your food prices to their income level without delivering value.........if you sell crap in the worst neighborhood that same crap should be priced the same in a affluent neighborhood....same crap different place. No value means lost customers ....
5,"Possibly the best burger Ive ever had--definitely the best Ive had in Phoenix. I get the classic, which comes on brioche with a choice of cheese. Its the only thing Ive ever ordered there, because its so damn good I cant pass it up.  AND they get their beef from humanely raised, grass-fed cows. And beer selection, and the fries with aioli... Well, others here have told you how good they are. Pro tip? Throw a little of that aioli on your burger, too. Oh, and come hungry--its a generously sized burger. Its a little pricey, but Delux is a really delicious treat."
1,"Terrible food, terrible service. I ordered chicken fried rice. The waiter brings me a bowl and says, ""chicken fried rice, right?"" I look into the bowl and its a bowl of brown rice. This must be a joke. I tell him thats wrong, and next me brings me a bowl of rice, seemingly fried?, with vegetables and no chicken. I bring that back to the counter and say my order had chicken in it, bringing my receipt along. So finally, they bring me a bowl of chicken fried rice. Or at least their version of it. I didnt think it was possible to actually screw up something as simple as chicken fried rice. The rice itself was cheap long grain rice. It was inedible due to the how stale/hard it was. Like absolutely no water absorption. And the rice was all covered in something that made it very wet and practically slimy. Disgusting. I have no idea how people can eat this. Oh, and that server who brought me the brown rice and claimed it was fried rice tried to bring lettuce wraps to the table next to me saying it was their salad. Theres a nice picture on the wall which shows you what the salad is supposed to look like, and its not lettuce wraps. The best thing about my meal was the fountain drink, which cost $1.85. The Circle K in the same plaza has bigger cups for 99 cents."
4,We were trying to choose a new place for lunch at work and this was mentioned. We all LOVED it! (that is saying a lot!) We ordered off the online menu and I called it in (she was VERY friendly) it was ready in less than 10min and was hot and delicious!!! It also doesnt cost an arm and a leg and is close enough to go there fairly often. We will be back!
4,"Im shocked to see there arent many great reviews for Maria Maria.  My wife and I have been there several times, including a breakfast stop and always come away very happy. The steak fajitas are so good my mouth is watering as I type this.  They give you several salsas with your meal and my favorite is the chipotle style creamy sauce that comes with the fajita.  This is the stuff that dreams are made of.   Also their guacamole is so good and fresh.  Love the salsas as well!  Everything else on the menu, though is a little off.  Dont bother with the mole, it was just gross. Very cool decor and sometimes they have live guitar.  Very classy Mexican restaurant.  Go for the steak fajita, guacamole and salsa."
4,Only three stars?  Wow--maybe it was the ambiance that sucks overall here--I dont know.  I actually didnt go here myself.  It was my wife.  She brought me home a cheese enchilada plate and it hit the spot--even lukewarm. All I know is that meal was better as a leftover than a lot of the fresh ones Ive had at taquerias around the tri city area.  Makes me wonder how it would taste if it were nice and hot. . . Okay--challenge accepted.  Ill let you know.
2,"Fuck you all, we hope you die. Thats the Trojan Battle Cry! Wow, I can not believe someone Yelped PV.   My freshman year, my science teacher was arrested from embezzling from the strip joint she owned. We then had a different teacher every couple of weeks for the first half of the year. When we finally got a permanent teacher, the damage was done. The kids had no connection or respect for any teacher who walked in the door anymore.   The year I graduated, there were 3000 students and over 1000 in my graduating class. We often had 40+ kids in one classroom.  Man, I hated this school. When I first started on the Bell Rd Campus, we referred to it as PV Prison because of the tall, iron, spiked gates and security in golf carts patrolling the campus for potential escapees. I remember, before they briefly closed the campus for renovations, a girl falling through the auditorium wall, and pieces of the ceiling falling on peoples heads before they condemned it. After 2 years at this location, they suddenly closed the campus and opened the new campus on Union Hills, the campus that was to become North Canyon.  They built the new campus with the intention of having both schools open, but as more and more buildings kept falling apart, they decided to shut down PV and re-open it under the same name on the new campus.   They spent a shit-ton fuck load of money on a super high-tech theater, in return for letting it be used for official Govt events,  that no one new how to use. This was one of the best things about it. I was one of the few people who could run the sound and lights and got out of class frequently because of it.   I remember making a video with Casey about an art show the school was having and not being allowed to air it on the morning video announcements because we used the phrase ""come out of the closet"" and they thought the phrase might be offensive. Then, that same week, the football team had a video where they all pretended to be gay, talking with lisps and flailing limp wrists. When I went to the office to ask what the fuck, they told me that football players didnt need approval for anything they did. I remember my friend being expelled for missing too much school due to chicken pox and a mother not well enough to call her in. I, of course, seemed invisible to the system. I ditched class often, and it never showed on my record at all. I remember when Miss Lee dressed as a hard rocker with tattoos for halloween and the administrators making her change it because the costume was a bad influence. I remember my friends boyfriend being suspended because they searched his car for drugs (on an anonymous tip) and found a box cutter in his trunk he used for work which he kept in his trunk because he went to work straight from school.  I remember testing out of highschool classes before freshman year, yet being subjected to 4 years of bullshit. I am pretty sure it was PVUSD that was the inspiration for the movie ""Pump Up the Volume"", which was filmed in the general area.   When I quit the softball team, the coach/school councilor kept sending people to pull me out of class to try to talk me into playing again. When we took pictures for the badminton team, we didnt have enough uniforms for the entire team.   I felt like I was in some prison or some high security mental facility. In fact, when my mom visited the new campus, she was horrified there were no windows and they used the drab, grey/blue colors they use in mental hospitals she had worked in to keep the patients calm. I never had a chemistry class. My two history classes consisted of a teacher who spent one entire year talking about Shakespear, and another who said that ""The slaves did not have it so bad"".  My Biology book was so old, it had my friends mothers name in it from 20 years earlier, AND same friends mother warned me against my Biology teacher, Mr. H__. ""If he ever tells you to stay after class by yourself.. DONT.""     The Good Things I Remember -  Mrs. Toal [sp?], a very good, and supportive, English teacher. Miss Lee, the best photography/video teacher ever and always had the best Halloween costumes. Hanging out at lunch under a tree with the boy we called Rico Suave who said he lived in a box and would tell stories about the Horny Lady. Sneaking off campus to go to Barrows Pizza. My friends  wearing cut out Trojan condom boxes pinned to their shirt at the forced ""spirit assemblies"" and chanting our own spirit chant of ""Fuck you all we hope you die, thats the Trojan battle cry"".  Time has a way of blurring the past, and making it less icky. Yet, my sister is a teacher at North Canyon, and a few years back I went and visited her on campus. The second I stepped into the main building, I felt sick to my stomach. Literally.   I hear they have made improvements since I graduated, and I hope so. I dont want my niece and nephew forced to survive another drone factory."
2,"Have been to the Garage twice now and they are batting 1 for 2.    Went there on a Saturday for lunch and the food and service was excellent.  I had the pulled pork sandwich with sweet potatoe fries which was original for pulled pork served on a pizza crust bun.  My girlfriend had the buffalo chicken salad which was really good, grilled chicken in buffalo sauce on top of baby greens.  Excellent beer selection. Went there on a Friday for happy hour and got there a little before 6, there was a 30 min wait for a indoor table or immediate seating on the patio, so we decided to sit on the patio.  Hostess sat us and said a server will be by shortly, normal procedure.  About 10 minutes later no server had come by and the hostess returned and asked us if we ave been helped yet, we said no so the hostess said she will get someone.  Another 10 minutes and no server.  It wasnt busy on the patio about 5 tables occupied, all with food and drink.  We decided that they must not want our business, so we went next door to Sushi Eye. Will try again, just wont sit on the patio."
3,"Priceline had this resort as 4 star but it looks and  feels like 3. The employees are nice, though. WiFi 13$/24hrs. Grounds are nice."
2,Food was marginal....Sunday brunch.  Prices were stupid.  And I felt like I  was in a New Orleans night club...on Sunday morning.  Ick
2,Dear God I should have ran to the hills when I walked in and saw 5 out of 5 people working there with electric shears in their hands. I refuse to call them stylists. I mean all I wanted was a trim for my 7 year old. Just a straight line. Id hate to see her take a sobriety test.
4,"yummy! thats all i have to say about my blazin buffalo sandwich on foccacia . the foccacia was a perfect specimen: light, appropriately herbed and airy. the sandwich fillings (sliced roast chicken, tomatoes, ranch, lettuce, and buffalo sauce) were fresh and yummy. i had a coupon for a free drink which made my sandwich, chips and a drink $7.47. a pretty awesome lunch for less than $8 makes me happy. almost as happy as buffalo sauce makes me. i have a tendency to be obsessed with buffalo sauce. a word to the wise: my co-workers got pasta salad and it looked awesome. they said it was tasty too. i was jealous. theres no up-charge for pasta salad - i recommend you get that instead of stupid chips you can get at the grocery."
5,"The pizza is my favorite in Phoenix.  It is light, airy and tasty and does not give you that ""I am reading to explode as my cotton mouth is making me drink two liters of water every half hour"" feeling. The ingredients are fresh and delicious.   I am hooked!"
3,Great place to grab some quick groceries.
5,"Id give it about a 4.5, but I like rounding up for local businesses!  The owner has been in there every time Ive shown up, and the food comes out hot.  The prices are spot on what youd expect to pay, and so is the quality.  Im not from Chicago, and have only been there a couple times, so I wouldnt be able to speak to its authenticity - but I can speak to its taste and the great customer service the crew provides every time.  If youre in the neighborhood and thinking about a hot dog, burger, fried zuccini, italian beef sandwich, or chicken burger, skip Sonic and DQ - they cant touch this place with a 15-yard drive-thru window."
2,I was very disappointed my last experience at Sauce. I ordered a spinach and apple salad with chicken. I think the apples were from a few days ago wtih no taste and the shredded chicken must have been in the freezer and put on the salad. The kids however did enjoy their mac and cheese. The salad was terrible!
3,"Another ""do-it-yourself"" bridal shop with rows of dresses tightly packed on racks in big plastic bags.   The woman was super quick swapping out the dresses in the room.  As soon as I walked out in a new dress, she had the old one out and the new one ready to go and waiting for me in my room.  I might have rated this store a bit higher, but I didnt seem to have any luck here.  Dresses were either way too big or way too small and I just didnt find any that I liked.  I have heard of many people having success here and the prices are reasonable, just didnt work for me.  The dress shopping continues. . ."
2,"I was in Mesa for a workshop over the weekend, and this was a convenient place to eat. I wasnt overly impressed. The food was ok, and there was nothing wrong with it, but I expected more from Mexican food in AZ."
5,"Aaron Has Been My Tattoo Artist for a long time and the quality of Aaron and all the artists in this shop are amazing very clean,sterile and safe.  Be Back soon need some work done"
5,"PCG is the restaurant by which I judge all others. PCG is totally dependable, always excellent. Service is always good, food excellent. i have eaten here probably 20 times and have never had a bad meal.  Although the food is not ""challenging"" in that there are no weird flavors or textures, if you want a great nouvelle American meal for a reasonable amount of money, you need look no farther than here."
3,"I was so looking forward to going to this restaurant.  It has a nice view of a man-made pond, but the food is barely average.  If the ambience wasnt so nice, it would get only 2 stars."
5,"Nice casita that can sleep 6 for $99, plus free breakfast. What a deal. Service was excellent but the catered food was TERRIBLE!"
4,"I have been eating at Tokyo Express since I was teeny tiny.  My fam used to go a few times a week.  Its still the same and still as good.  I have tried alot of the items on the menu.  I like the regular terriyaki, the tokyo chicken, the sukiyaki, and the bentos.  The bento boxes are a ton of food for only about 7 or 8 bucks. I would definitely recommend this place for to-go japanese or a quick rice bowl lunch."
2,"I used to go to them, but stopped several months ago.  They are more expense than other pet food stores.  I only purchase Wellness brand dog food and thier supplements.   They were out the the supplements.  When I asked one of the guys when they were goingto get some more, he also told me that Wellness stopped making the supplements and got a little nasty with me about how Wellness was now selling at Petco.  He then steered me to another brand, which I didnt like & didnt work as well as Wellness.  I contact Wellness & at the time they were still making the supplements.   So the guy at WnW lied to me.  The rest of the staff was always friendly Wash my dogs there?  I just heard them into the shower stall - its easier."
5,I have been to slippery pig a half a dozen times in the last few months since moving in nearby. I have nothing but great things to say about the shop. They are friendly and courteous and I havent experienced any of that bike snobbery that comes with LBS. I am glad I found a local shop with great service
5,"A few days after the amazing Yelp event at Brio, I decided to go back to enjoy my FREE bruschetta! This visit was yet again, AMAZING! First off, Kimberly, our waitress, was the most personable, helpful, awesome waitress ever! She was very insightful and suggested some pretty tasty appetizers. Im not a fan of eggplant, but she assured me it was to-die-for. She was not lying, it was delicious! They also had the same live music as the Yelp event had and he was just the perfect sound for a happy hour date on the patio. Then, to top it off, the manager that was hosting the Yelp event came over and introduced himself. Thanked me for going to the Yelp event and for coming back! So hospitable! I felt like I had a second royal treatment! Thanks Brio, you guys are awesome!! :)"
4,"Wow. What a difference. I came here last year and was disgusted. Being German and moving to the USA as an adult I know how German food should taste like and this was an embarrassed.   Since this place was still better than the other German place (Black Forest) we decided to try it again.  What a pleasant surprise. The food was very tasty.  So I realized why the change...they now  actually have a German chef instead of a non German chef  which they had for years. Also, the staff was very friendly and attentive and prices were great.   The only reason I gave 4 instead of five stars is b/c they did not offer a choice between soup or salad and just served Egg Drop Soup which was ok; however, on a hot summer evening I would have preferred a choice.  What an improvement!  We will be back."
4,"You are so clean, Sky Harbor.  I dont mind flying out of this airport. The flight attendants are nice. Security is fast and thorough. I really dislike one lady that works in security, because she was rude to me for no reason. It probably wouldnt have bugged me so much if it werent for the fact that it was 11:45 PM, I had just worked a double, and I was being forced to fly to Ohio....where it was cold and still had snow on the ground.. Oh not to mention on my Spring Break.  Anyway, the stores are nice and have a good amount of nice items to buy for your flight to keep you occupied.  Flights are on time the majority of the time, and when they arent they at least warn you.. *cough cough* Cleveland Hopkins International *cough cough*. I suppose it could use some remodeling."
5,SawTh[sic] Sense Christmas show for the second time last weekend.  Great show - laughed my ass off.  Thinking about going back for closing weekend...  :)
5,"If you like P.F. Changs, you will love Pei Wei! Its essentially the same thing in a less formal dining setting, & Take-Out! I cant tell a difference between their Orange Chicken, or the lettuce wraps minus the price tag!!! My favorite dish here is the Dan-Dan Noodles! (Its Hot. Spicy, & Pure Indulgence Pleasure for under $10!!!) If you have not heard; ""Pei Wei is not authentic Asian food!"" Well neither is Panda Express, but Ill tell you Pei Wei is better than Panda Express & most Authentic Asian restaurants in the US!  Yes I said most Authentic Asian restaurants! (NO MSG!) ""Can you believe the balls on this guy!?"" Well I have had Chinese food in China Towns in San Francisco, LA, NY, Vancouver & Dallas! Ive even had Peking Duck in Hong Kong; dont be impressed it was not that good! I love Chinese food, but I really love Asian Fusion! Roys, PF Changs, & Pei Wei really wet my noodle! The other nice thing about Pei Wei is their take out!  I have them on speed dial... So when Im on my way home from work Ill call, & as I pull in I pay, pick up, and go! Its freshly cooked & No Wait!!!"
3,"Located along the infamous, gutted for future LRT, Central Avenue is Community ( you know, like rainbow community) Florist. Serving the sistahs for years is a helpful, friendly and knowledgable staff. Prices are well below the chain florists here in Central Phoenix and I always like to help the small business owner, especially during this construction madness. Ive purchased flowers here that last well over a week. They also have an eclectic collection of vases, things for the garden, cards, etc. So if youre trying to woo that special someone, or perhaps you messed up with the mister or you simply wanna say to yourself, ""Im special. I like myself. I deserve tulips""....get on down to Community Florist. You know its about time yall stop to smell the roses..."
5,"Ive been to several local dermatologist and havent seen results or been fond of any; the staff is extremly friendly and very helpful! I highly reccomend this dr, he is knowledgeable & helped me attain the results I was looking for!"
2,"Just ok good in a pinch but not best!  I have learned to like that spicy sesame chicken,  I dont like it leftover though.  They also get points for very good behavior and treatment when I called in my order to the wrong location,  they called the other store and made my order at the correct location."
1,"Weve been going here for 25 years and I had my first BAD meal recently. A rotten chicken tamale, the corn meal might have had rancid fat in it or the chicken was rotten, either way it was stinky. The wait staff didnt seem outraged and shrugged it off as though this has happened before.  I may go back here in another year, but Rositas Place is off limits for me now."
5,"The Roaring Fork is one of my very favorite restaurants.  I am not a big fan of the environment, particularly the patio and back rooms, but the food more than makes up for it.  The pork green chili served with warm tortillas is dreamy.  I also adore the huckleberry margaritas.  Cant go wrong."
4,Great hh prices. Like to go and unwind. Definetly give it a try
3,"On an evening walk through Roosevelt row during the monthly First Friday event, I overheard what could only be Jazz funk pouring out from the door just up the way. I walked by and someone sitting out front invited us in for a listen to their free music event. Once inside, the wife and I were greeted by the snack bar ladies asking us if we would like one of their cookies, candies or sodas in the bottle; we got a diet coke for a $1.  The Nash a decent sized venue with about 12 or so four seat tables to sit at, none of which are particularly better than another, with the tables in front being the only exception. The music was good, if you like Jazz music as I do, but I think the band playing this night put together an oddly slow paced set with more of a blues and experimental Jazz than I would have liked to hear. From the amount of people walking out during their set, seemed like others also harbored the same opinion. I usually like my jazz with a little side of funk; a thick base line, Jazz guitar, and complimentary piano and horn of some type. We stuck around for about 5 songs and decided to move on. It was First Friday after all. This place could really use some Kool, and maybe even the Gang. I imagine the music is subjective and changes on an event by event basis. I feel they really could step up the quality of foods, snacks, and drinks. The venue seemed more like it catered towards a teenaged crowd, especially considering their food choices were chips, candies, etc, and no adult beverages in sight. Although I cant see many teenagers running out to listen to a night of Jazz, I could be wrong though. If I find that someone worth listening to is playing at The Nash, I will likely head out again; but I dont think I would plan on just dropping in randomly for an evening of Jazz. Happy Yelping Phoenix. I cant get enough of that funky stuff!"
3,"When checking in I was greeted by the General Manager. It was nice talking to you Michael; I hope to see you at the Westin La Paloma. The Sheraton is great for a night stay if you plan on going to the airport. I stayed with my family for one night and caught a shuttle to the airport at 3:30am (Complimentary). Ugh so early, but my driver was very friendly. The night auditor was very helpful and was able to give my family a late check-out till 1:30. SO AWESOME!  I love late check outs, they make your day/morning better. No need to rush. The bathroom is a little small, vanity area is limited but fully stocked and you get a loofa. My little sister and Mom enjoyed the pool as well. Nice small patio area to enjoy from your room too. If I ever have to fly out of Phoenix or into Phoenix and have to stay over my choice is definitely the Sheraton Phoenix Airport."
2,"What a shame this place is doomed. From a flavor perspective, I have never found such an interesting Asian/fusion style of food in a quick-serve setting. The food is remarkably rich and spicy, its really refreshing to see a mass-market place be so bold. Being so deeply impressed initially, I really, really wanted to like this place. I have since given it about three or four tries. Yeah, not so much. First of all, Im not sure whether its the quality of the meat, the parsimonious manner in which its cut or some combination of the two, but their meat is always tough and stringy. When its breaded, the breading is inevitably chewy and hard because the meat inside the breading is so insubstantial that all the moisture gets sucked out in the frying process. Not even the chicken comes in substantial enough chunks to be juicy.  The amusing thing is, what made me like this place at the outset was the delicious sauces. Youre enjoying the sauces so much you can easily overlook how crappy the meat is. Alas, that will only take them so far, as time and time again you are reminded of the crappy meat as you are compelled to floss vigorously. Portions are another issue. Theyre too small for the price. Instead of takeout containers overstuffed with rice and entrees, grandma-sized portions are stingily arranged on a small plastic plate. I never have a problem finishing my entire meal and I always wish there was more.  I think Pick Up Stix has a bit of an identity crisis. On the one hand, they want to be Pei Wei, all flashy stainless steel and fancy real estate. On the other hand, come on folks, its takeout faux-Chinese (""pick"" ""up"" - see what they did there?). The best takeout faux-Chinese is always known for generous portions at low prices. At Pick Up Stix, you unfortunately get neither. The patronage reflects my opinion about the place each time I go: its always nearly empty. I really dont expect it to last. Thats a shame, I really will miss the unique flavor profiles."
5,"Great place!  I love that they feature wines from ""the little guys.""  You wont find most of what they feature at any Total Wine or Bevmo.  Small business supporting small business... totally awesome in my eyes!  The staff is knowledgeable and ooooh Chef Sarah - your food pairings with the wine in the wine 101 course were AMAZING!  Katie, the sommelier, is fun and she knows her stuff, plus it is clear that she loves to share her knowledge of wine with everyone.  Ill be back for sure!"
3,I like this place because of how original it is and the menu has something for everyone. Unfortunately it is tucked away in a hard to spot location and therefore continues to be a great secret. I would recommend to anyone in Arizona to make a trip over and see what this place is all about. I think everyone will be happy with it.
1,"I really hate to do this.  This restaurant is fit for those that think Taco Bell is a great place for Mexican food. The buffet was pathetic and contained maybe 12 items (no white rice).  My sampling of their offerings ranged from terrible to mediocre.  China Garden has, hands down, the worst eggroll Ive eaten. Given the atmosphere of the place it was plain to see China Garden had regulars.  One guy at the cashier even commented that hed been coming since 1970.  I dont get it.  This is the worst restaurant I have ever dined at. The staff and whom I presumed to be the owner/manager was nice and friendly but that cannot make up for the poor quality of selection and food."
2,"It hurts me to say this, fue to the fact that I love local businesses in my hood and I fully support them, but here is another restaurant that I wish would have been better... Good news...More restaurants opening in Downtown, more options especially late night options... Bad news...More restaurants opening in Downtown wanting to make a quick buck but does not deliver on food and quality... I came here with a couple of friends really excited to try the only sushi restaurant in DT open for dinner.  There has been some good review on the place and I wanted to give it a chance...I should have gone north to Hana or Yasu! Walking in, I noticed the decor was another warehouse looking restaurant trying to be modern...only thing is , its not.  From the neon lights under bar to the wood paneling to the tin like tables, chairs, and barstools...its been done 30 times over.  I wish it had more character, a little bit more distinctive.  We are in the art district.  I dont want to walk in a restaurant that looks similar to ones that are already open in the same area?  Okay enough with that, the artist in me is rambling again..sorry..back to the ""food"" review. Food:  The menu to me was a little confusing.  For being a Sushi joint, it had so many other things also, mostly stirfry items.  I decided to stick to what I came here to try, sushi.  I ordered squid salad to start.  I should not have ordered that to start.  The salad was so salty and it was drowning in dressing...bad start...I then ordered some sashimi including saba, sweet shrimp, and of course my favorite toro.  I was a little disappointed that they did not have uni..how can you not have uni!  Saba...not bad... Sweet Shrimp....foul tasting Toro.....couldnt even bite through it A good sushi joint has to have fresh fish...good sushi needs to be executed by a sushi chef with good knife skills...simple as that.. When your fish is not that fresh and your sushi chef fish slicing techniques are not there, you have a losing combo. My friend out of frustration had the head chef make us something...He brought out the geisha roll. Spicy tuna is not my thing but out of courtesy, we did ask him to pick, I tried it..it was ok, again I am not too keen on chopped up tuna, which in this case tasted like it was food processed.  A little too mushy.. Drinks: Beers: Been done.  Infused vodkas: Been done Cocktails: Been done. Good Points:  Nice staff, cool Teapots, and clean restrooms All in all, I guess I was hoping for a sushi joint that was more innovative and creative with equally good skills to execute.  Maybe I am too harsh.  Or maybe I am just saying it how it is...As I left the joint, I felt like I have been to a sushi restaurant like that so many times before... Hopefully they will succeed with less critical customers unlike myself..best of luck!!"
5,"Well thought-through details make Lux amazeballs.  The espresso is good. Really good. Like, I need to order an espresso along with whatever else Im ordering just because it is so delicious.  The food is beautifully presented (little light on the gluten free snacks, but theres fruit, so no one is starving).  Theres plugs all over. The furniture is mostly easy to wipe down. The bathroom door has written out instructions so no one is confused on when the door is locked. It also has nice smelling soap.  The patio is really pretty. The clientele seems ridiculously cool. I kind of feel like maybe Im going to be cooler by association if I hang out here. IM GIVING IT A GO. Let me know how Im doing."
4,"Self service, good mix n match favors and lots of goodies. Be careful, the bowls are big and you can easily pay more for a single serving than a gallon of Breyers at the grocery store.   Very dog friendly place. They will bring out a bowl of water and a small softserve with dog treats stuck in it for your little dog."
1,"I have been a ""regular"" customer at this salon ever since it opened.  At first it was great!  Clean, relaxing, and welcoming.   After a few months without a manicure or pedicure I decide to treat myself to a manicure this past week.  I went in and a lady did a beautiful job on my gel manicure.  She paid attention to detail and didnt rush through the whole process.  I didnt have time to get a pedicure so I decided to come back the next day.  I only wish that I had her do my pedicure yesterday ...  The guy who did my pedicure had some sort of infection on his thumb.  I didnt notice it at first because he was using gloves but when it was time for the foot massage he took his gloves off, revealing it.  Tracy was doing someone elses nails right in front of me and clearly saw that he had some sort of sore or fungus on his nail.  It was completely black and it looked like something was growing out of it.    I was shocked that she didnt tell him to at least put his gloves back on.  The ""massage"" that he gave me was hardly any massage at all.  He did the same motion over and over while concentrating on the tv.  Definitely not worth the $25.   The worst part is that he gave me an ingrown toe nail.  The whole right side of my nail is swollen and I just hope that I dont get an infection.  This was by far the worst pedicure that I have ever received. Even though I had a great gel manicure here, my last experience was so horrible that I will not be back."
5,"Lets start by disclosing that I grew up in New Orleans, went to school in Lafayette (home of the Ragin Cajuns), and REALLY know good New Orleans/cajun food. I grew up eating great po-boys, gumbo, red beans, and wouldnt consider eating any of these if not well prepared. That said, I can truly say that Jennifer and the Flavors of Louisiana gang make cajun food as good as any youll find in New Orleans--SERIOUSLY. The po-boys are spot on (though the bread could be a little crustier) and the chicken & andouille gumbo is even better than mine--and, I assure you, thats DAMN GOOD. Frankly, Ive never had better. The only thing that is not ""as good as it gets"" is the red beans and rice. Theyre good, but not quite the creamy ""Washday Monday"" staple that I grew up on. My cajun grandmother has Jennifer beat on that one, but not by much.  But, if you want a special treat and want to taste something that kills all, get a sausage po-boy. Hot sausage or smoked sausage po-boys are a New Orleans staple and my favorite po-boys of all. But, Jennifer blows them all away with her home-made andouille. Simply put, Ive never had better sausage--ever. Its the reason her gumbo is soooo good and her po-boy the best ever. Ive eaten at Flavors many times, even though I live across town. Every time I go, I eat like a pig and bring some home to eat later. I have no affiliation with the restaurant, but wanted to post this as a review from someone who really knows New Orleans food and as a thank you to Jennifer and her crew for giving me a source for the best flavors in the World (not just Louisiana). As a matter of fact, I even overlook the fact that Jennifer is from Baton Rouge, instead of New Orleans or Lafayette and for not having any USL/UL Lafayette paraphernalia on the LSU/Saints wall. At least that is, so long as she keeps her promise to open another restaurant on the east side of town--that is, a lot closer to where I live. If you want the ONLY good cajun food in Phoenix, treat yourself to Flavors of Louisiana. For me, its just like a visit to any of my favorite po-boy shops in the old neighborhoods. It really is that good."
3,"I think this is the second time Ive ever been to a Chilis...actually Im not even sure if its the second....it could be the first time Ive been to a Chili - I think the other time it was Apple Bees or something like that...anyways yeah well yesterday night my bf and his friend and I finally went to this place called JumpStreet - to jump our fat away  - but after that we got really hungry and it was around 9ish and after in Arizona closes pretty early but luckily Chilis closes at 10 so we were able to get a table and eat a fatty meal. They had a $20 dollar for 2 meal deal - in which for two people you pick a appetizer and 2 entree from their list - super good deal! We decided for the Tostada Chips and Fire-Grilled Corn Guacamole for the appetizer - its good, however I didnt like the chips because it was very thin and was a bit oily - the guacamole was good and had a hint of spiciness to it.  For the entree I had the Quesdilla Explosion Salad - interesting name and very tasty too except that I forgot to tell them to put the dressing on the side cause they put a little more dressing than I would like. The salad consisted of grilled chicken, cheese, tomato, corn-relish, cilantro, and tortilla strips tossed with a citrus-balsamic dressing and on the side four triangular cheese quesdilla! mMmm super delish! My bf ordered the margarita grilled chicken served with rice and black beans, tortilla strips and pico de gallo - doesnt look really good but it tastes okay. Despite being a chain restaurant, the food is not bad and the prices are definitely a bit cheaper than other big chain American family restaurants."
3,"Could have been 4 stars...  I went here for the first time last Friday.  It was busy, but they dont have that many tables and there were at least 4 waitresses on that I could see. Our services was sooooooo slllllllow. Like painfully slow. We waited a long time for refills, a long time for our food, a long time for the check to come. It was really annoying. Our waitress was nice, but slow.  Onto the food! We got an order of wings and an order of the fried zucchini. The zucchini was really good but holy hell she should have warned us that it had JUST came out of the fryer that may have been heated by lava. I popped one of those bad boys in my mouth and immediately felt the skin on the roof of my mouth start to come off. Once the burning subsided I was good to go. I hear the wings were tasty, They were really big (I just dont eat wings)  I ordered the fish and chips. So yummy! Our friend got the grilled chicken sandwich with a side of grilled asparagus. LOVE that they offer grilled veggies as a side! I snuck a couple asparagus and they were tasty. Hubs got the ribs, it was a huge pile of meat on a plate. He loved it!  I will for sure go back, the food was really great, I will just know not to expect quick service."
4,Great prices with great selection. Great for your everyday shopping needs.
4,"we went here for dinner and drinks, and it was awesome. the giant soft pretzels are amazing, buttery, and delicious and are served with a roasted pepper cheese sauce. they are awesome, but get them to share, the butteryness is rich! the prices are reasonable, and the patio is nice to sit out on! even better than the food, service, and prices is the music!! they play an awesome selection of music!!"
4,I have been to this course a few different times.  The summer deals brought me in because it is a little pricey during the season.   The greens and fairways have always been in good condition and I enjoy the challenging hills and strategically placed bunkers.  I havent really scored well on this course but as a beginner golfer I enjoy the challenge this course offers.  Water jugs on every tee is crucial for the summer months.
2,"id rather go to amados! the only thing thats good here is the bean dip, and im only saying that so that i have something nice to say."
4,"Fez completely deserves five stars but as a pescatarian (vegetarian plus fish, as much as I hate labeling how I eat) I had very limited options. My husband and I ate here on a rare trip to downtown Phoenix.   The burgers sounded mouthwatering but unfortunately there wasnt a veggie burger substitute.  Many restaurants offer this and I really had my heart set on a sandwich. My husband ordered the Fez burger, a delectable combo of honey molasses BBQ, spiced pears, and lemon garlic aoli.  I was fairly jealous but my shrimp kisra (flat bread pizza) was obscenely good with lobster sauce, wilted spinach and parmesan cheese. We also split an order of garlic rosemary fries, which were delicious.  I wish we would have saved room for dessert as the portions were huge and really two much for us to eat! Normally I take my leftovers to go but since we were out for several hours I didnt want to leave anything to waste.  Id definitely come back to Fez but I wont be putting it into regular rotation due to the lack of veggie friendly sandwiches and entrees."
1,"What happened to this place?  The first time I went about a year ago, both the food and service were great. Second time, last May, I ordered the same dish and it was horrible.  Drowning in sauce.  But, at least the service was decent. Just went a third time and it will be my last.  Both the food and service were horrible.  Went for lunch, sat inside and it wasnt very busy.  Our waiter was totally out of it and only had 4 tables and hardly paid any attention to us and kept forgetting things, like taking our order to start.   Then, even the food runner forgot to bring me half my meal after I asked her for it.  In the meantime, I counted at least 17 staff member hanging out in the kitchen area, which is open, so you can see them and half of them were folding napkins. My food was not very good and actually made me a little sick.  This is a shame, especially because there arent many places in Phx that have vegan choices, but for the price you pay, I would expect a lot more."
4,"Visiting from California, and refusing to drink Starbucks because Im a complete ""Coffee DB."" When traveling, I try to find the local coffee gem in the barrage of coffee houses. This place is great, just how I like it.  Smug employees / clientele, and fantastic coffee.  Better than Bluebottle, not as good as FourBarrel.  For those of you know what I just said, I raise my cup from my saucer in your general direction :) . The edibles looked amazing, but was a little disappointed with the chocolate and cinnamon donuts I picked up for my family to try.   I ordered a double cappuccino, as its my go to, did not sweeten it as it was easily enjoyed by itself. Love seeing these small companies roast their own beans on site.  Love the fact they are taking great care with the roasting process.  Thank you for not burning the bean and making my beverage it so enjoyable. Kind regards to the Lux team, I will certainly visit you tomorrow, provided youre open on New Years day :) Yum!"
4,"Let me first explain that we came to the place on a bad night...  Apparently, one of their regulars LITERALLY drank herself to death - spent a week in the hospital before whe finally died.  Instead of a funeral, her husband and family set up a memorial at her favorite bar...  The place was filled with long hugs and sobbing... all while the gals husband was hammered and wobbled leaning on the end of the bar.  Sad, sad, sad, sad...... on SO many levels......... That said, we just tried to stay away from it all... and our server (Bobbi - hope I spelled it right) was really great in keeping happy, warm, and chatty. Ignoring the other patrons that night, then, this place is definitely a great little legit Irish pub (apparently the oldest in the Valley for you history nerds)! Firstly, they have all sorts of Irish food items (cottage pie, corned beef and cabbage, bangers and mash, beef stew, seafood, and they even have a boxty).  We tried a couple different things that were all tasty! Next, almost all of their beer taps are dedicates to Irish or UK beers (Guinness, Smithwicks, Harp, Kilkenny, Magners, Newcastle, etc...)... and they know how to pour a stout! They didnt have live music that night (apparently, they normally have live Irish bands 6 nights a week)... but they played a great array of REAL Irish music the whole time! I read a couple reviews that claimed its not an authentic Irish pub...... but Im guessing these folks havent spent a whole lot of time in Ireland?  Understand that ANY bar, in America, has to have cheeseburgers and chicken fingers - because youre not IN Ireland...  That said...... if a bar plays Irish music... has 7 of 10 taps dedicated to Irish and UK beers (with the other 3 Irish or UK STYLE like Killians, Kiltlifter, and Sam Adams)... has all SORTS of Irish food on the menu... real Irish signage (not shamrocks)... proper stout pours in two-parts... plays Irish sports on TV... supports the local Irish clubs..... what makes it NOT a legit Irish Pub? This place is about as legit Irish as youll find in Arizona... and worth a visit!"
5,All around great food.  True Texas brisket experience.  Meat has great flavor and tasty sides add variety to the offerings.  Dont forget about the sheet cake for dessert!!  Ill be back.   ***Read another review on here talking about wings.  They dont have wings here!!  Get your reviews right people.
4,Super friendly staff and smoothies come out so fast...delicious too!
5,"I love this place!!! OK. where do I start.. Great place to stop in for a quick lunch. AMAZING outside grill, everything is good. Best cheeseburger Ive ever had. I dont even like Salmon and theirs is good. Good salad bar and salads ( pasta, tuna etc..) The pizza and sushi.. again amazing!! And........ they have about 10 different iced teas to choose from. Also, they have a great breakfast. Omelet station and all. I suggest the chorizo and egg burritos. GREAT outside patio"
5,We ordered seabass and ribs. Both excellent choices. Service very good. Ambiance was unexpected. Felt like we were in hawaii with an open feel with palm trees. Used restaurant.com coupon. Great deal.
4,"I have been here three times now.  Each time I brought a different guest. I have become a huge fan of their Green Chili Burger (I cant remember the correct name).  Sweet potato tater tots and the sweet potato french fries are great.  The chicken sandwiches rock, as well.   I like the venue. And, I have always liked the service.  I keep coming back here because everyone has enjoyed it, found something on the menu they like, and I often crave that burger.  Give RnR a shot!!"
1,"I wish they had a ""0"" star option too! The service and food was awful. Just a bunch of kids running the place.  The place closes at 10pm but when we went in there at 8pm all the workers were too busy cleaning to go home early to help us.  The food was burnt  on one side and raw on the other. The manager was too busy flirting with the other help. We couldnt get drinks because all the glasses where dirty, we were told by our waitress. We asked for the manager before we left at 8:45 and was told he already went home for the evening. What kind of manager leaves a bunch of teenager to run the place?  NEVER GOING BACK!!!!"
4,"I am a little finicky with pizza. I dont think Venezias can be beat (for Arizona pizza).. Since bitches are crazy, and make you move out of the house you practically built for them... I no longer have a Venezias near me. I moved to Chandler with eyes scouting for what could be my new pizza joint. Foxs Den caught them quickly. I ordered a large 2 topping pizza with 10 hot wings for pick up on a Wednesday. My order was 10 bucks! Now.. this is not the best pizza ever, but it kills your major pizza chain any day. I highly recommend trying these guys."
4,"Kinda of a rough and tumble crowd at times with the OTB booth in the back corner of the bar. Place is usually crowded after work with the blue collar drinking types and unless your a regular you will probably get ignored like I did on a previous visit. In this case, finally tried the food and it was surprisingly good. The waitress said that the buffalo wrap was good, so I went with grilled chicken tossed in mild wing sauce and that went into my wrap with the usual cheese, lettuce, some blue cheese and maybe a touch of bacon? THe wrap was huge and the chicken and blue cheese melded perfectly together. On the side dish selection wheel, I went with sweet potato fries - this was a decent version of that variety, but the raspberry sauce? served as a dipping option was a fail. Great service on a saturday afternoon and reasonable prices ($8.99) for a filling lunch."
5,"FILLY-Bs!!!!!  only 8 reviews?? NINE now!!! wow do i miss THIS place: - 24hrs - drive-thru or walk up only - ridiculously cheap - ridiculously tasty of course the arizona burritos are good, everything is good. i used to LOVE one of the combos... you get a beef burrito, taco, rice and beans... for UNDER $6.  wow.  color me silly and call me sally. they have bomb horchata too. really good and fresh flautas/rolled tacos and breakfast burritos. damn, everything here is good, whether drunk or sober."
3,"Decent bar food with all the servers dressed in Alice Cooper attire.   I am being open-minded and starting this thing off with 5 stars.   Minus one star for being a bit overpriced on the appetizer end.  I ordered onion rings at $8 per order.  Seriously, are 15 onion rings worth $8?  Minus one star for not having any parking.  You have to park a couple of blocks away in the ghetto area to find a spot.  You will have 2-3 beggars asking you for change to and from your car.  There was a dude who wanted to wash my windows for money.   Minus half a star for putting the gratuity on the bill and charging for it.  I hate that crap.   Plus half a star for the waitresses who are dressed heavy metal-like wearing mid-riffs with the tramp stamp.  I always wanted to date chicks like that, but was ummm...to busy with umm....other chicks chasing me down.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, and I just umm...you know, didnt have time for them at that point in my life.   I better stop my review now."
4,"5 words.... HAPPY HOUR ON A SATURDAY!!! Yes, every day actually! from 3-7pm and a late night happy hour too starting at 10pm!! How can that be true??? Well I guess in Arizona they know how to party! $11 pitchers and $3 pints, yes it could be a little cheaper, but hey it is a happy hour every day of the week! And their beer is really good! AND they will give you FREE samples of all of their beer too!!! This is like brewery heaven!!! To top it off, a group of people came here in Crank or Drank shirts on their first ever biking and drinking tours and this was on their tour for good reason! Their Hefe is awesome, complete with lemon wedges of course, and their Sunbru was so so refreshing on that hot day in AZ! Adriana and I definitely had our fair share of pitchers, along with an order of their beer battered fries and their specialty ice cream cake! Well, that was actually roopas, and just an FYI, oreo crumb crust and Hefe dont really mix......so save the cake for when you are done drinking ha ha But the waiters here (the ones that dont look like they are 15!!!!!) are helpful and friendly and nice, and you will definitely get carded here, even though literally I actually felt old here since all the girls look so young! Some of them must have had workers permits I swear! That aside, as long as they can bring me good beer on happy hour prices, I am sold."
1,"I got a BBQ chicken sandwich and all the bones came complementary! SICK!  I almost broke my teeth when I bit into it.  The service was even worse, the manager (I think) stood in the way of me ordering while he was talking on the phone about football for about 10 min.GROSS!"
4,Outback is a chain resturant ~ so they have their formula perfected.  Each time we hav eaten at OUTBACK we have had a great dinner and good service. Lately each time we try to eat at OUTBACK there has been a 20 to 30 minute wait  ~ we dont always wait . .  .but its wonderful to know that things are picking up and that there are quality resturants that have waiting line ~ to me this is a blessings. : )KC
5,"I go to Regios a lot; today I went and want to reiterate how great I think it is.  I have been going there for a couple years - have never been disappointed in anything Ive ordered.  Their beans are delicious, as is their menudo (only on Saturday and Sunday, unfortunately), and eveything else: tacos, burritos, enchiladas, chile rellenos, etc, etc, etc. is great.  It is so inexpensive its hard to believe.  Today my bff and I had 5 tacos and an order of beans (between us) and it was $10. HELLO! We had the mini-tacos, but we were stuffed and left there saying how wonderful it was and how full we were.   Check it out next time youre in the mood for some awesome, authentic Mexican food.  You will be glad you did.  Yummy."
5,"Los Olivos is a Scottsdale institution and I wont hear a word against them. Especially not when I have a few margaritas in me. They take good care of regulars, especially at Happy Hour. The chips and salsa are delicious and they keep them coming. I recommend the mini menu, they are a great way to sample stuff if you like to try a lot of different things, but my favorite meal is definitely the Chicken Poblano. Mmm, so good! The shrimp chimi is also fantastic. I never leave without feeling totally stuffed."
5,"What can I say about this place? I love it. Its straight up the road from my place. You can find everything here, not just Asian food. When I get a hankering for Bombay spice, off to Lee Lee I go. I love LOVE their meat counter. I get chills deciding which pork hocks I want. The fish fry service is nice. They have stuff I cant live without and cant find anywhere else i.e. aloe vera juice and those sinfully delicious dessert rice and of course, the makoks. The cashiers can be a lil raunchy though just smile and nod. And a little known secret? The vegetables are freshest on Fridays."
1,"Donuts are really good, if they have any when you get there!!!  Went in on a Tuesday morning at 1030, and they only had a total of 10 donuts. Drove out of my way to go there and still ended up at Dunkin Donuts. Very disappointed!!"
5,I love this place! My girlfriend and I go here to celebrate special occasions and the staff is so friendly. We sat at the bar last time and the bartender Jesse was so great. The happy hour menu was amazing too. $5 Mark West Pinot Noir! The manager was super friendly and came over to make sure we were doing okay. Great experience! Definitely recommend the calamari too!
4,"Once again, the pizza was delish. They were super busy last time I went, and my gf and I had to wait a while to see a server, but they apologized for the wait, gave us two free sodas and were understanding that we needed our food to go ( Kick-Ass started in like 30 minutes!).  Very cool."
2,"Bleh!  Ive heard good things about this place from my sisters friends (notice, I didnt say ""my"" friends) and Ive always been curious.  Errand days are kinda ho-hum anyway, so I was excited to finally check this place out.  The reason I order a doughnut that is stripped off glaze and topping is that Id  like to taste the actual product.  Two doughnuts for my little guy and me for $1.60.  As the girl handed me the paper bag I was extra careful handling it for nothing.  Cold doughnuts?  Am I just so used to piping hot beignets?    Right off the first bite, I could feel the cheap hydrogenated oils coating the roof of my mouth.  Then the second bite, the feeling is now in my throat.  Eeek!  I asked my son what he thought.  ""Its okay,""  he stared at the doughnut and looked up at me.  I grab his doughnut and along with mine threw both in the paper bag it came with and chucked it.   Honestly, it would have been better to fry these sinful things in lard.  There is something about chemically laden food that I despise most! Would I give it a second chance?  Not until they change their frying oil! Sorry, Bosa.  One star is for the nice service and the other star is for being a local chain."
4,"Enjoyed the weather outside today and sat outside on the fake grass patio for lunch. I ordered the Oreganos fav Jr salad and the sausage pesto pizza, I did however manage to convince myself that I was too fat for a pizzookie(though I dont recommend you talk yourself out of it...Ive been regretting since I left!) The salad was amazing like always. This particular pizza I tried for the first time! I loved the sausage, very full of flavor but could have had a few more on it. The tomatoes were good as well. But the pesto sauce...kind of lacking. Not too flavorful, couldnt really tell it was there. But I am never disappointed by the tomato sauce pizzas...do try. This location is great to visit because they are usually not ""as"" busy as the other locations."
3,"I wanted to add a review to the actual companys website, but I could not figure it out. Im curious where all the testimonials came from.  I have mixed feelings on my experience. In the end, I think I ended up with some beautiful windows, though. My salesperson was very engaging. I felt pretty confident in my decision to go with American Vision Windows after that first experience. There was some miscommunication on scheduling the measurement, but it worked itself out fairly quickly. I started to lose confidence when I was told a specific date that my windows would be in, but never heard anything from the company four days after that date. When I called them to find out where my windows were, I was told they had just received them and they could schedule my install in 2 weeks. Since I only had Saturday install available, that was understandable. The Friday before my install, they called to reschedule to the following weekend because the rainstorm (that just occurred that day) had put them behind two days. Again, I guess that was fairly understandable, but I felt like the peon that was the easiest to push off.  Luckily the installers did show up the following Saturday on the earlier side of the provided time frame. I kind of dont know what to say about the install. There were two guys, one seemed to know what he was doing, the other I had less confidence in. The job took 4 hours to install 6 windows. During the entire transaction I was never told how long the install would take, so Im not sure if that was normal or not. The two guys actually seemed to be fighting during the entire install. I believe the head guy was joking around with the other by basically telling him he sucked. I think the other guy was genuinely getting angrier and angrier. In all honesty, I was very uncomfortable being in my own house while the install was going on. I was a bit disappointed in the cleanup of the job. I ended up having to cleanup inside the window tracks and windowsills on the inside and brush off the sills on the outside. I dont feel I should have had to do that. Before they left, I was handed a survey to review the entire process (salesperson, overall experience, install). I think that is a horrible practice that needs to be changed. I didnt want to sit there writing out a review on all of the above while the installer is waiting for me, and then hand it right back to him. What it did cause me to do is overstate my review because Im not going to give the installers 2 stars and hand the paper back to the person I just reviewed.  I cant say I would recommend this company, but I feel the way customer service has been going, its really a tossup on what you will get from any company. P.S. I forgot to mention my plants. I have recently spent a lot of my own time and money on landscaping my backyard so this stuck out to me big time. I understand when installing windows its difficult to pay attention to the foliage below your feet, but I think some attempt to not trample all over the plants would be very much appreciated. For example, when washing the windows, I think an effort can be made not to stand directly on top of a plant and twist your foot back and forth. Im still hoping I do not loose a couple of plants due to the trauma they endured."
4,"This is was, WAY out of the way for me. But when I heard about Thats Amore, I just had to try it. What can I say, I love gelato! Anyway, one afternoon I talked the kids into a Sunday drive with cool gelato as the reward. While Thats Amore gelateria is located in a strip mall (what in Arizona isnt?), the taste and style are pure Italian. Credit the fact that it is owned and operated by two sisters and their husbands who emigrated to Scottsdale from Italy. The murals of Italian cities on the back wall were even painted by their father, who they brought to the valley for just that purpose. How cool is that? It might not make the gelato taste better, but it almost made a ride to Pinnacle Peak feel like a trip to Napoli instead."
2,"This place is essentially a copy of the old Fathers Office (www.fathersoffice.com) in Brentwood, CA.  It took me a while to get over that fact and give it a decent try.  Among the things Delux has copied from FO is the famous ""Office Burger,"" which Delux calls the ""Delux Burger.""  They also bring out the fries in a shopping cart just like Fathers Office.  What Delux fails to copy, however, is the quality of the food and the high-end nature of the original.  At FO, the wines changed weekly and are all incredibly rare selections.  The beers at FO also tend towards the more obscure.  Delux seems to concentrate almost exclusively on beers and does have a decent selection, but nothing you cant find elsewhere.  Wines are available, but as an afterthought, and definitely not of the quality served at FO.  For Phoenicians who never experienced the joys associated with the original Fathers Office, youre missing out.  Its like being an Eric Clapton fan but not even knowing who Muddy Waters is.  But all the imitation aside, I have to say that Delux does a pretty good job with everything and they have taken the FO concept and adapted it to the PHX strip mall environment.   Food wise, everything I have tried was ok.  They did change their sweet potato fries a year or two ago because the other ones werent ""crispy"" enough.  The problem is that these new crispier ones have no flavor.  When they were testing out the new fries, the manager asked me and a friend to opine and we told him the truth: We said the new ones are flavorless.  I guess we were the only ones who thought so because they went ahead with that change.  That lost them 1 star from this review.  I would rather have the soggier more flavorful ones (who knows how they make these new ones so crispy anyways?).   When I go here, its almost always out of convenience and late at night.  Not many places of this caliber stay open until 2 am, so its about all there is when you are in need of a late night meal in this part of town.  Their 2 star rating is based on: clearly knocking off one of my favorite places, Fathers Office (minus 1 star) and for ignoring my feedback on the new crispy tasteless sweet potato fries (minus 1 star).  They also lose a star for retaining the FO prices but substituting Phoenix strip mall quality."
5,"I have been looking for a great therapist for a long time.  Someone that takes the time to read my body, to see the synergy of the muscles and be able to do the work.  Finally, I found Robert.   He has been an LMT for more than 15 years in the Valley and continues to educated himself often.  His studio is located conveniently just off of the 51 about 10 minutes in a quiet residential neighborhood. The massage intake questioning was thorough, but not invasive.  His set up is calming and the room & table were warmed by a heater!  The massage lasted 90 minutes or so, I didnt want to go back to the real world.   He does offer Gift Certificates and has Pay Pal set up on his website if you didnt plan ahead with stopping for cash.   I will definitely visit him again when I need the work!"
4,"The ambiance of this place is pretty great.  I made the comment while we were having diner that it would be a great place for a first date.  That way, if it is awkward, at least there is plenty to look at to make the time pass.  The food was pretty good for the price.  The service was also great.  Id happily go back again."
4,"I dig this place.  I have only ever eaten here for lunch, but I have been here a kabillion times, and I love it.  The only 2 negatives are the parking and the SEMI-cash-only situation.  Meaning, this place DOES take credit cards if your order is over $25! A lot of other Yelpers have complained that the male owner is a little rude, and his wife (I think?) is the other owner, and she has always been okay.  I guess I am from the east coast, so they seem totally fine to me, but I can see where AZ people think theyre a little gruff.  Whatever... I am not paying them to be nice-- I am paying them to cook me some awesome grub. The best sandwich, to me, is the Italiano because its the best prosciutto I have ever had.  The texture and quality makes it melt in your mouth.  Also, you can have this sandwich on focaccia (my friends usually choose this option) or the homemade Italian bread, which is my choice.  Its soft and that dusting of flour just makes me all Italo-happy.  Its served with uber-fresh basil as well.  There is a balsamic dressing that is usally served on top, but I ask for it on the side, as I dont like my bread to get mushy.  Finally, the sandwich is pretty big, so its worth the $10.  (Its gotta be $10 worth of primo prosciutto alone!) The other key choice is the pizza.  I departed from my beloved Italiano one day (but only because I had already eaten it 2 days before) and ventured toward the pizza.  I am suprised to say that its really great!  The crust is perfect, and its just the right amount of doughy. My advice is to try it.  Get there at 11:30am or 1:00pm for lunch.  Carpool.  Bring cash.  Smell the air when you walk in.  Order the pizza.  Make plans to go back and try the Italiano.  ;)"
2,"Spoke with the office manger she confronted me on the Yelp review. I told her the truth I shouldnt of been schdled to see the general dentist there when the Oral surgeon wouldnt be in until Oct! and they knew that befre I came in on 8-10, I should of been called befre 8-10 so I can switch offices before coming in and wasting everyones time. I hope they keep their end of the bargin since I was told 3x I will not be charged for x-rays that I dont get a bill and actually get chrged. Im happy she told me that she will take it to her higher ups to work out their issues with scheduling as it will probably help them. But my experience so far was a waste of mine time and I feel the only way they will change is if they get reviews that really work on it. The office wasnt busy when I went..whats keeping people out??"
4,"LOVE Oreganos! They have delicious pizza, pasta, salads, wings, everything. The portions are huge and the prices are right and I can honestly say Ive never not left Oreganos full and satisfied! Plus the atmosphere is fun as well. If youve saved room after your meal, try the pizookie, its amazing. Giving 4 stars because there is always a huge wait and they dont take reservations or seat you until everyone is there, and also because the deep dish pizza was far too cheesy and saucy when I tried it (more than a deep dish should be) but everything else is superb."
4,Such good sandwiches! The meat is cut fresh just as your Sammy is made. Desserts to die for. Plus the family that runs this joint is cute! Yummm!
2,"A very inadequate meal and expensive for the low quality food you get.  Ordered the veal sorrentino and it was not enjoyable to eat.  Very dry, tough...just gross.  Caesar salad was also disgusting and unpleasant, saturated in dressing.  I did like the atmosphere, laid back and comfortable.  Knowing that Pasta Brioni is down the street, I wont go back."
3,"Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum. Good selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and theres anything left in it.  Id give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience. I think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they cant handle the heavy flow on weekends.  Theres not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.   Dim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, its swarmed on by a pack of vultures. If youre willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, Id highly recommend China Chan.  Its much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menus much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh."
5,"Considering my experience with a previous dentist, I was hesitant to try a new one. But my experience was absolutely the best.  Foothills Smiles is the best dentist I have been to in the valley!! They are professional, friendly, and reassuring allowing their patients to feel comfortable during the visit.  Most people dread going to the dentist, but I feel motivated to continue going to my 6 month check-ups!!"
5,"On one of my many visits to see mi amore, he took me to this fantastic little pizza joint. The aesthetics of the place were overwhelmingly perfect. I believe the maximum seating capacity of the dining area is 45, yes folks, 45. So the 2 1/2 hour wait was expected, and very VERY worth it. The pizzas are baked to order in a classic brick house oven. The toppings arent what youd find in your local Pizza Hut, either. You can choose from fresh slices of mozzarella, slices of perfectly seasoned italian sausage, pepperoni slices, salami slices, arugula, fresh basil leaves, tomatoes, etc. Basically what Im getting at, is this is beyond words delicious, classic LEGIT Italian pizza. Around the dining area, you will see freshly baked loaves of focaccia bread, that is later served to you with extra virgin olive oil for dipping once you are seated. The smell in that place is heavenly.....incredibly reminiscent of my grandmothers kitchen!! PS GET THERE EARLY!!"
3,"SALSA BAR RAID!  that is exactly why I do when I am at this place. The salsa bar is the main attraction for me. There are many great salsa options, plus fresh cilantro and peppers. Some of the salsas are good enough to be eaten straight, like the mango salsa, it makes a good desert. The menu for this place is somewhat somewhat limited t mostly burritos and tacos. Recently the menu was revised and the cheaper items were removed and more expensive ones were added in their place. Every meal comes with a small side of chips, which adds even more use to the salsa bar. The grilled green onion that used to come with each meal is gone and missed."
3,"I visited one Sunday afternoon just to check it out in reply to an ad I saw to visit for free for (5) days. Typically, when you respond to ads like that from a gym, the staff requests your information such as name, address, & phone so they can sell you on a membership later. That was not the case with me. It was very informal. I advised I was not a member and wanted to give their place a shot. The guy in the front desk said come right on in; no personal information requested and no tour. Im glad there was no sales pressure. I thought the no tour part was kind of odd, but after doing my walk through, I understand why. The place is not very big. They have weights and cardio machines and the treadmills each had a personal television on the machine. The whole facility appeared clean and there were free towels for the taking for your workout. The lockers in the mens locker room were really nice. They were made brown wood. You can view a sample of the interior of the facility on their website. They looked really classy, but they were not free. There were cabinets offered outside of the locker rooms that you can keep your personals in with a latch that allows you to insert your personal lock on. There was also a small room for classes. I wasnt very impressed with this gym mainly because it was very small. I came during a Sunday afternoon when most gyms dont see much traffic so I dont know what its like during normal high traffic periods such as early mornings and after 5pm on weekdays. I would imagine that due to the small size of this gym that they cater more to the very local crowd. I wouldnt give this location a poor rating because there wasnt really anything that stood out that was negative other than the limited space and equipment. You might think of this location as the alternative to the larger chain gyms like 24 Hour Fitness, LA Fitness, or Lifetime Fitness. You can always take a look for yourself; apparently, they dont provide too much sales pressure for visitors. Anyway, thats my say on Mountainside Fitness at Bell Rd in North Scottsale next to the Ice Den skating rink."
3,"Spinatos has great red sauce for the pasta but I prefer a more earthy pizza. High School kids love it though.  This restaurant was a Chilis before, but they have remodeled and did a fabulous job. The take out door is discrete and the bar area is large and comfortable.  Food portions are quite big and they have a nice selection on the menu."
4,"My super close, local taco shop. For me, consistency is key, and Filibertos is always a step above most other restaurants ending with ""tos"" in that regard.  Im fairly mental for their Chicken Soft Tacos on corn tortillas. Larger than a typical street taco, they are almost sized more like a mini burrito - Shredded Chicken, a red pepper sauce, lettuce, and melted cheddar = AWESOME. Tuesdays they are only $1, all day!  Finally their Adobada tacos are a bargain at thrice the price. Avoid the Chili Relleno burrito, however. It may be one of the worst things to ever get passed through a drive-thru window."
4,"This restaurant is in my TOP-5 favorite restaurants of all-time!  ...The only reason I am not giving it 5-stars is because it is a real splurge, and it takes a pretty special occasion (and experience) to justify such an expensive meal. While in my personal experience at Posh, the quality (and ""deliciousness"") of the food I had definitely justifies the price-tag, it should - if the quality wasnt extraordinary, it wouldnt rank at all. You really do have to be an open-minded, mostly omnivorous eater to fully appreciate it though.  If there are ingredients or flavors that you dont much care for, it might be more challenging to assume that you will like everything you get.   It can be daunting, because you may get something that you dont like, but that is also part of the excitement (and the adventure of trying new things!)  You also may get something that youve never had done well before and find that you are a newly converted fan.   Also, though the wine parings are wonderful, if you are on a budget, skipping the wine is a good way to trim the bill. For the best experience, dont go when you are famished, and dont bring picky eaters with you - both will interfere with you having a completely satisfying experience."
2,I moved to phoenix from northern California where I would get my Dutch Bros. fix almost every day! Either I was spoiled by the great customer service in my area or the service here is really that horrible. Ive gone a handful of times and they have all been extremely shallow and inattentive. Not to mention theyve all charged me different prices for the same drink! One person charges me $3.50 and someone else charges me $5.25?? Get your act together and be a bit more friendly and real with your customers.
3,"love dicks, richardsons etc etc but come on Im throwing down 120$ get some  servers / managers with customer service skills."
5,Excellent burger
4,"Drove into Phoenix today and headed straight to Mrs. Whites.  It seems we were a bit early, and we had to wait outside while it opened.  An employee came outside while we were waiting to grab a smoke.  He was friendly and started up a bit of conversation with my husband about the place.  It turns out he was one of the cooks. When were able to finally get in, we were offered drinks, and ended up getting sweet tea, which I dont care for.  I got the smothered pork chop and two sides, the mac and cheese and the black eyed peas.   We got a corn cake to eat while we waited and when the meal came it was pipping hot and very good. Service was excellent and prices were reasonable.  I recommend this place for some true southern food."
5,"Move over Jacques Torres! Angela has come to town and just might be the next big thing for Phoenix (and the confectionary world!)  I happened to find this place just on a whim....I was reminiscing the other day about all the wonderful chocolatiers in other big cities, and it occured to me maybe there is a chocolatier in Phoenix?  Sure enough, there is!! (thanks yelp!) and shes GOOD!!!!  Angela is as sweet as her candy is! She explained how she just started this business in October of last year; she is a self-taught, talented and creative, as authentic as it gets, chocolatier! She uses all organic ingredients, including fair-trade organic chocolate. You will find many whimsical truffle flavor creations like Raspberry Rose, Mudslide, Strawberry Balsamic, Lavender Lemonade, Madras Curry, Avacado Wasabi, Maple-Smoked Bacon (yeah, I KNOW!)....and like a million more! AND the best news of all, is that she says she has perfected a dairy-free recipe for truffles...I. CANT. WAIT! I hope Im the first to order that batch!! Besides beautiful, flavorful truffles, she makes her own marshmallows (in various amazing flavors as well) Chocolate Bark (which is always dairy-free) and even different hot chocolate mixes.  The most amazing thing of all is....now, get ready for this....all of this magic comes right out of her home kitchen!! THAT means, everything is made with *love* :)  So, if you happen to yelp this, like I did, the map will actually take you to her business, which is located in her house, in a neighborhood (a little confusing at first....) but it IS LEGIT! She said normally its by appointment only (I was not) but she gladly had me in and I got to see some of her gastronomic creations anyways (yay!) However, she says that she normally sells her stuff at the South Scottsdale Farmers Market (Wednesdays) and the Tempe Farmers Market (on Warner and McClintock on Saturdays) In fact, if you go to her website, you can customize a box of chocolates and pick it up at the farmers market of your choice... (cant wait to do this!!) Needless to say, this made my day...no, like, my week! SO excited to have a real, gourmet chocolatier right in my own neck of the woods! Woo hoo!!"
3,"So I recently went here with a friend of mine because they were craving IHOP, and I didnt care were we went to eat as long is it had food. I got one of there new healthy choice menu items the balsamic chicken and my friend got the club sandwich with a side salad and a side of pancakes...dont ask. The food was surprisingly really good and the service was excellent."
3,"After reading multiple Yelp reviews on this business, I decided to come here for the greatest hits: Pizza muffins, Calzones and Antipasto salad. I thought the pizza muffins were interesting and a great alternative to bread sticks or garlic bread. They were loaded with TONS of sausage and ham and came with 2 different dipping sauces. Although a little greasy and re-heated, I appreciated the novelty factor. On to the entrees, the small Antipasto salad (5.99) was absolutely filling for a one person meal. I didnt find it any different from any Antipasto salad I have tried before, but I think people love it for the dressing - which had flavor but A LOT of oil (more than half of the total dressing). The ingredients were fresh but there is nothing out of this world about iceberg lettuce and dry mozzarella.  The calzone was larger than a newborn baby and hotter than Phoenix in the summertime. Although the corners are mostly (if not all) bread the taste was very good and overloaded with tasty insides. The spinach ham combo my friend ordered was pretty satisfying and this meal could easily be split in 2 for tasty leftovers... if you can stop eating. I found the teenage staff to be friendly and cheery but the bathroom needs massive help. Only one stall and really unpleasant smells, the female employee who had just left the bathroom as I entered left wet paper towels on the handles of both exit doors... covering the entire area for me to hold on to and pull. Just.... disgusting, especially from an employee who should be trying to keep the establishment clean and good looking. All in all, good but not great. Its pretty affordable so if this is your price range, I think you can make it work and still have a tasty meal."
4,"Ate there for the first time last night and the food was fantastic. They did a great job on the remodel, so its a lot more open than it was before. They have an extensive wine list and the service was wonderful. We will definitely go back!"
2,"I hated this place. It looks like a nice first date restaurant but the food and price are so not worth it. The hot tofu soup was pitiful and my fiance ordered the bbq and a sushi which were both too expensive for their own good and the sushi tasted like something was old....Never again! Chodang, here I come!"
4,"Only 4 stars because I have seen better. Nevertheless, AJs is a great runner up to my personal favorite which is the  thriving local business of Portland, OR called New Seasons. If you have been to a new seasons you know that AJs is the close primo of find food grocers. I will one day visit the the other AJs in town. This place is a nice bike ride to from my house and has really nice employees...AND THE ONLY place near me that sells kombucha Relax and pleasant atmosphere. [like]!    R_"
5,"Yes, this place can be a bit pricey, however if you catch them at happy hour or on ""girls night out"" it can be very affordable. The atmosphere and the ""specialness"" of the melting pot is unbeatable. I have been there for intimate occasions, and family birthdays. Food is wonder, especially the cheese! The menu has changed a bit over the years, and there are some oldies I would love to see return (the mushroom salad), but there is nothing that beats this place for any special occasion"
5,"Dana, there is no other like Dana!  Even my kids ask to go visit her!   I have 4 children, 2 boys ages 3 1/2 and 5 1/2 and 2 girls ages 8 and 19 months.  Dana has been cutting their hair for quite some time. They all have a style of their own and have always been happy every time we leave. She has a great shop in Downtown Scottsdale, convenient and is very accomodating.  Highly recommended by this Mom and her children!!"
4,"I love this place. What can I say?  Richard Cho not only has some of the best customer service skills I have ever seen (that guy has an amazing memory for names) but some of the most creative approaches to making Sushi in the valley. I love coming to Sushi Eye, I have never had a bad experience in all the years I have been going to the 2x New times Best of Phoenix award winner. The use of Macadamia nuts is brilliant and an amazing addition to many of the creative rolls that are available. The Spicy scallop roll is a go to for sure. They have (and I know this sounds stupid) the BEST California rolls in Arizona. As pedestrian as that roll is, The California roll is transformed in to a very dessert style treat when ordered at Sushi Eye. Seriously, do it. Go check it out, introduce yourself to Richard and be amazed when he remembers your name. You will be amazed by the food as well."
4,"The contemporary and American art sections of this museum are 5 stars, outstanding! I also loved the overall museum layout and architecture."
3,"I truly wanted to love this place! I had the shrimp/pork spring rolls and shrimp/chicken vermicelli salad - both were quite good, with the exception of the rice paper and noodles tasting like they were rehydrated with unfiltered tap water (both had a weird taste). My husbands food, on the other hand, was terrible! He ordered #44 - the rice was extremely dry and chewy, the pork chop tasted ok, but was mostly bone and gristle, and the shredded pork was downright disgusting."
5,This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Phoenix. This is where we go to celebrate and to enjoy a night out with amazing food and great service. Noca is an experience. I wouldnt recommend trying to quickly hit up a meal here before trying to catch a movie. I cant imagine trying to rush the experience! On our most recent visit I immediately ordered my favorite cocktail- the Dirty Bird. Its so perfectly crafted and smooth...plus there are bleu cheese stuffed olives. Sold! I felt a little bad because my fiance wanted to celebrate our new jobby-jobs with prosecco... my bad. Lay off me when theres bleu cheese stuffed olives and vodka involved mister! First up was the mixed salad. I love how its not overloaded with cheese and candied fruit. Its the perfect balance of flavors.  We then had the lobster roll and it was absolutely heavenly. I really hated to share that but I needed to save room for the scallops. The scallops were so perfectly cooked and the plating was gorgeous. The flavors were outstanding- absolutely sublime. Ryan actually asked me if I remembered his name. I just smiled.
5,"So happy to have another option in our great restaurant rich neighborhood. The space is much larger than it appears from the street, and is broken up really well into comfortable areas. The open kitchen really does have an Italian country feel, and the lighting gives the very large open room a warm feel. Nice large bar as well. Best of all is the number of walls that open up to the outside-perfect for this time of year. Our server had the perfect combination of personality and humor-not too much, just right. The menu has a great selection, no matter your appetite. The Burratta was nice and creamy, with a nice compliment of apple slices and Rocket. The potatoes with parmesan, rosemary and perfect lemony aioli were off the chain. I wanted an order to take home! Pizza crust is very tasty and perfect texture. Hanger steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The brunch menu looks super yummy-we definitely have a new hangout on the hood. Great job, Sam Fox!"
4,"I mostly buy mountian house and other camping foods from REI, they have a huge selection to choose from, including biscuits and gravy. dont expect 5 star restraunt food, but on those long days at a Military range Mountain house beats the pants off MREs not to mention you could eat 3 mountain house meals and be about where a MRE is. Ive been drooling over several other items at the store, Id like to go backpacking sometime and they have tons of little things that could make things a little more tolerable for either Military operations, or camping/ backpacking."
5,Excellent food and service!
5,"I had looked at several invitation websites along with catalogs with no luck in finding just the right balance of wedding colors/design.  Thomas at Alphagraphics helped me every step of the way of designing and printing our wedding invitations and programs.  I knew I wanted a booklet-style, but needed a little design creativity from Alphagraphics which they nailed!  I highly recommend Alphagraphics to anyone needing any print work done - not just wedding invitations.  Thomas and his crew are stellar!!"
5,"You want a piece of me? said the gargantuan mango tango eggees cup. I said ""YES, I DO!"" and give me a big ol veggie samich and some fries to go with my brain freeze thank you very much.  Todays order is same ol same ol 12 inch whole wheat extra veggie grinder with extra crispy fries and a bigee flavor (mango tango) $6.50 w/ the captain card. How can you beat this kind of scratch for two people. you cannot. It was Yuuuummmmae! Unfortunately there is not much choice for vegan here but its all about the eegees! I now will add eegees to Best vegan for the money! and to Best far away vegan.  Check it! you will be glad you did! Review time Curbage: 10 I really like the fancy shmancy new eegees,but I like all eegees P factor: 10 very clean as usual Ordering: 10 no wait at all Meal arrival: 10 even with extra crispy fries it was fast Taste test: 10 yummy today and the mango tango is now my second fav to cherry cider Summary: 10 Thank you eegees! see you next month. Late gordo"
4,"Having gone to the now-closed location on Shea, I didnt expect to find myself at the new The Herb Box anytime soon.  My one visit was fine, but didnt leave me wanting more.  However, when Deb L hosted a recent UYE, it was the perfect opportunity for great company at the very least.  Well Im happy to report I received even more than great company....great food, great service, and comfortable, yet beautiful surroundings were also on the plate.   I began the evening with a glass of their house-made sangria.  I could drink this light and fruity beverage all day.  In fact, I think it would make a fine substitute for my morning OJ.  I did have a hard time choosing an entree.  While I was tempted by the pear and gorgonzola flatbread, I chose the goat-cheese chicken instead.  The shoulder cut chicken was perfectly cooked, but the meat itself was perhaps a little bland, although admittedly I do prefer chicken to be well-seasoned.  The goat cheese stuffing and the fig jam, however, resulted in an overall quite tasty dish.  I loved the mushroom risotto cakes served alongside!! The Herb Box also graciously offered our table a variety of sweet treats at the end of the meal...a slice of fig bundt cake (my favorite), a couple different cupcakes, a whoopie pie, and a passionfruit cake.  While all were enjoyed, none of these wowed me.  I do think these may have been pastries available at the market, and not their dessert menu items.    So thanks to Deb for giving me a reason to try The Herb Box.  Im sure I will be back again!  I didnt get a chance to browse the market!"
3,"Very well done pizza...its like a pizza pillow, tasty, savory and rather doughy. This is not my favorite style of pizza but nonetheless it was especially good pizza.  The service staff was top notch and the store is very warm and inviting. We will be back!"
4,"Love coming here to watch football. Every game is on and they have three huge screens. The service there is usually friendly, Ive never had any problems but sometimes my friend thinks the ladies are a little rude. Never esteem here but the drinks are pretty strong. When Im in Phoenix I come here for sports."
5,"Man, do I LOVE a restaurant with REALLY GOOD food and friendly service! Liberty Market is definitely that!  Funny thing is that I was originally going to eat at Joes Farm Grill, but ended up here (after a search here on YELP). Nice laid back decor too. You wait in line to place your order, pay, and they give you a stand with a number on it (like at Sizzler), then someone brings your order. I like places that spend the time to make their own salad dressings and take care with creating a delicious salad. The Italia was DELICIOUS and a perfect size! The homemade Minestrone soup was loaded with fresh ingredients and was REALLY fantastic too! I forgot to try one of their desserts...the last Red Velvet cupcake was ALMOST snatched up by another customer, but the Food Server was so kind to offer to get it to me (maybe I had a look of panic on my face??)...WOW!! This service is rare to find! The restrooms are quite amusing! Saw a similar set-up in NYC. Each toilet/water-closet is individual...no stalls. They were VERY CLEAN too (ok, I was seriously apprehensive that it might smell like a mens restroom, since it was all unisex...no worries!!!!) I cant wait to visit here again...but, after I check out their other place across the street: Joes Real BBQ. YUM!"
3,"4 stars for the patrons that attended. good looking, generally friendly, and hardly any douchebags. 2 stars for the cleanliness. I was there last night for a reserved, catered party and even though the food had run its course on the patio, nobody cleaned it up. fantastic decor coupled with disgusting expired looking food 2 stars for the bar service. ordered drinks three times and despite being at the barfront, it took 15mins each time to get a drink - which was generally underserved and overpriced. and this wait time wasnt just because sex girls were getting served... the bartenders were just that poor 3 stars for the ambiance. music, staff, mood of the club.  2.75 stars overall. with places similar to this such as mabels and az88, i prob wouldnt go back to this place unless invited."
4,"Service was great, Food was excellent...the down side was the tables were dirty! The place only had one table in use when we arrived!"
2,"First time experience. Tried turkey burger from the skinyalicous menu. Burger was ok but greasy. They served me a salad that has gone bad.  You donot serve a salad with rotting vegetables. Also Shepard pie we ordered had extra ingredients such as zuccini, so they should have warned us about not being a proper Shepard pie.  Gordon Ramsay would have been mad.  Service was good. Only saving grace."
3,"RIP I drive by here every day but looked over and saw the place dark inside and the signage ripped down. They never did quite recover from the roof collapse thing. Was the only Vietnamese place by my work, now sadly, there are none. They should have offered Banh Mi for lunch. Woulda-coulda-shoulda."
3,As much as you dont want to like Wally World...it is what it is...crazy!!
5,"I personally like this Frys. I think most of the people that work there are extremely friendly. I go there once or twice a week and Im always greeted with a smile. A few of them even ask me where Ive been if I havent been in for awhile and ask me how Im doing. Complaing about a grocery store being crowded doesnt make sense to me since that means people like shopping there. They have no control of it being crowded. If you dont like it crowded, go across the street to Safeway where there is no one shopping there. Then you will see a difference of why Frys is better. Why is it so busy? Because it has better deals and everyone wants to shop there. Its a positive thing. You can either deal with it being crowded once in awhile and save money or go to Safeway across the street where you will be the only shopper and get ripped off. You have options."
4,"Good food, good service, good price, shitty location. I had the carne asada plate which came with guac, beans, and corn tortillas.  The tortillas were amazing, the carne asada was above average, as were the beans.  Unfortunately, as good as it was, its still Mexican food.  Not that I have anything against Mexican food, it just, for the most part, all tastes similar.  Nothing really stood out as AMAZING.  If Im in the area (god forbid), Ill def. eat there again, but Im not going to drive from the E. Valley to go here.  Bonus points for having 7-Up in a bottle, made with sugar."
4,"Cracker Barrel is the antithesis of the trendy LA or San Francisco breakfast establishment.  They feature old-fashioned Southern breakfasts with biscuits, gravy and grits plus lots of other choices.  This a very well-run chain of all company owned restaurants.  Well-trained staff, quick service and meals served exactly as ordered.  The execution at Cracker Barrel is excellent.  While some may not like the food style, I enjoy it on occasion.   Our breakfasts were great and everything was served hot.  Very reasonable prices.  My only quibble was that the coffee is only OK."
4,"Im so glad that there is at least one Asian grocery store in the valley. Unfortunately they seem to have a hard time keeping some of my favorite items in stock, I wonder if this is a result of some of the import restrictions/delays that have been a result of the recent quality issues with food and toys imported from China. Im half Chinese and spent much of my youth being dragged around Chinatown near L.A. by my grandmother and 6 or 7 aunts. So the 99 Ranch Market brings back memories...some fond...some not quite so. But, at any rate, the prices are great and the selection is good and authentic (when its in stock). The cashiers could use a little dosing from the friendly fairy, however. Then again, I dont remember many friendly cashiers or clerks at any of the stores I frequented as a kid...so I guess it just makes the experience all the more genuine for me. I would recommend going on a weekday, or, if you must go on the weekend, just avoid going around lunchtime. Theres a dim sum restaurant in the same shopping center and the parking lot gets pretty jam packed with cars and pedestrians."
5,"Postinos is a great date restaurant. Especially on Mondays and Tuesdays when they have their $20 bruschetta and bottle of wine special. You can choose any bottle of wine off of their fairly long list of wines and get a delicious board of bruschetta for only $20. Major win. The proscuitto and fig is my absolute favorite, followed by the artichoke, brie and apple, and salmon and capers. The restaurant has a great interior and patio with a huge wall glass garage door that opens up to connect the interior to the exterior when the weather is nice. If you join their mailing list, you get a free bruschetta board on your birthday and the restaurants birthday. I also love their sea salt caramel sunday - its the most delicious dessert ever. You have to try this place. Its just great."
5,"Staying at the Royal Palms has been on my bucket list for a while now, because Ive stayed at just about every other resort in town that Ive really wanted to check out.  Oddly enough, this also happens to be the closest one to where I actually live, so it seems strange to drop a load of cash to stay in a hotel four miles away from home.   No matter, last month was my golden birthday and this is where my lovely girlfriend decided we were going to stay.  Score.  We had my party (a surprise, nicely pulled off) and we invited a bunch of people back to our room afterwards to continue the festivities.  It was a pretty standard room, a bed, fireplace, a couple of chairs, big bathroom, a table and chairs on the patio (I believe they call it a valencia suite).  Life was grand. Until the morning.  *bang bang*  WTF is that noise?  *bang bang*  There was pounding and various noises coming from the room next to us, and it wasnt happening on the bed.  Are they really doing construction at 8:15am?  It continued.  My girlfriend called down to the front desk.  The noise stopped.  Then it continued.  *bang bang*  We were about to lose it. They called our room, ""do you mind if they continue working?"".  Actually, we had just fallen back asleep... So this is not how the Royal Palms treats their guests.  No, any resort with a Director of Romance is serious about making their guests stay enjoyable, so I knew this was not normal.  A conversation took place, and profanity and yelling wasnt even necessary.  Essentially, they were going to comp our room, but they offered that we stay another night in the presidential villa for the same price...how could we say no? I hung out at the resort all day because I was feeling miserable.  They comped lunch, and about 4pm, they moved us to our new room.  Nice place, the presidential villa.  Its actually only one bedroom, but has a huge living room, dining room, kitchen, two fireplaces, three patios with fireplaces and water feature, old-school tub, double-shower with outdoor shower, a bidet,  you know...typical amenities.  I was still feeling terrible (yay, the flu!) , so we opted to order room service from T. Cooks.  Naturally, if they hadnt done enough, they comped dinner as well. We had an extremely atypical experience at the Royal Palms our first night, I have no question about that.  But they more than made up for it.  They were gracious, they smiled, they apologized, and they made it right immediately.  I cant ask for anything more from that from a place that prides itself in its customer service.   I would not hesitate to stay here again."
5,"The best staff around! Very friendly and always make sure you are satisfied with your food. The food is great as well. From breakfast to lunch, and healthy shakes like Fast Fuel, you can get it here. Very clean too!"
2,"After hearing for years that this is Theeee Best Breakfast in town I finally checked it out.  Now Ive been twice, and I just dont get it.  I just found NOTHING special about this place at all.  Its a cute breakfast dinner and the pancakes and waffles are ... well, pancakes and waffles. Both times Ive been we had to wait to be seated, and both times I didnt feel it was worth it. In my opinion Palette, Over Easy and Matts Big Breakfast are so much better.  Of course your mileage may vary."
3,"Its like being a Target girl but recognizing the value and prices of Walmart... so I dont make a point to shop here (vs LeeLees with greater intl variety), but when I am in the area... I frantically think of what is low in the pantry so supplies can be restocked at a minor savings.  The pricing is marginally cheaper -- to clarify, the auto 10% discount is calc off the non-sale items."
4,"So Wednesday evening I needed milk and cat food. On my way to the store I realized my stomach was growling. Never a good idea to shop on an empty stomach. A while back in The Savvy Shopper rag in the China Grill ad was a little banner about Wok n Stix being a new location. And because of an event that fell apart this week I had a bug to eat something Asian. So I found it and stopped in. Chinese fast food. They also have hamburgers and a few other things. I stuck with something I figured I would like, orange chicken ($7.95). It came reasonably quick, was too hot to eat right away. Most of my Chinese fast food consists of Panda Express and Ming Gee. This was much better, in addition to the onions and bell peppers listed mine had mushrooms, celery, sprouts and some other stuff. Service was on styrofoam with plastic utensils. Even though I was eating in the rice came in a take out box which I thought was sorta weird. I still hate eating out alone but at least I wasnt the only person in the place. Each side of the place had a long upholstered bench with tables and chairs that could be slid along to make up different seating and two tables in the middle. There was nobody being served at the front counter when I was finished so I stopped,picked up a menu and talked to the woman there and found out she is an owner. They have had the place for 6 months and are the same family that owns China Grill not far away."
3,"The fitness part of this place is great: machines are new and plentiful.  Good classes on the schedule, and plenty of cold water and fresh towels. Now, the spa, on the other hand, is mediocre at best.  The pool is a bit of a walk and available to anyone at the hotel; same with the jacuzzi, which also means the jacuzzi is outside!  Why no jacuzzi inside?  The steam room is small and there is no sauna.  There are only 3 shower stalls, with shampoo and shower gel, but no conditioner. The lounge area is also small and not at all relaxing.  And the robes are super thin (with a chilly room; thats not even nice!) and not very big.  I had to sit very carefully so as to not expose myself to everyone. Hello! haha. The massage itself was very nice, but the spa is not relaxing, especially for the prices.  I wouldnt return to the spa, although the gym is good."
3,"The person before me reviewed Phoenix Greyhound Park as a Flea Market. I....will be reviewing the Greyhound Park in Dog Race form.  We came here during 4th of July night, after many drinks and BBQ-ing and swimming at my relatives home. Prior to leaving to come here, it sounded like a good idea - I was comparing the dog races to the Del Mar horse races in San Diego in my head. But, during the drive, I started feeling wary. This is Arizona, and theyre racing dogs in 110 degree heat? What is the constant tugging at my heartstrings? This guilt isnt working for me.  The track is outdoor, while the patrons betting on these beautiful animals sit indoor in stadium seating, behind huge glass windows, watching giddily while drinking beer and eating snack bar-type foods. Admission is free.  They do keep the dogs indoor before racing them. I decided Id relent and bet on a race, then immediately felt like an asshole when they brought the dogs around for the camera and I saw them dressed in numbered garb and muzzles. I lost, but I didnt bet for the rest of the races we stayed for, it just didnt feel right. Everyone else had a good time, though, especially the winners.  How can I get so excited about the horse races but not the dog races? Im a walking contradiction."
3,This is just like Filibertos. Fast-food mexican food. Its really good and taste pretty authentic to me. My hubby and I stopped in for a quick bite to eat and we went there because he heard it was good from his co-workers. Im a huge critic of mexican rice and beans and this place has it down. I got the lunch special of the day which was 2 bean tostadas with beans and rice. It was sooo much food and I was so stuffed!  Next time I will get something smaller. You cant beat all that food for $5! They have a good salsa bar with all the fixings!
2,"Uhhh...These are supposed to be carne fries?  ASU boys think that these are the best carne fries. Me thinks not. The carne fries consist of boiled meat AND the order is wrong. Its supposed to have the guacamole on top of the sour cream on top of the melted cheese over the meat, but they just dumped the boiled carne asada on top of the sour cream. I told some ASU boy about this, but he said that I probably had a different person making my carne fries  the wrong way. What a disappointment, but I ate everything anyway because Im fat like that. hahha"
4,"My family was on the west side of town yesterday and since we dont know that area quite as well we wanted to try a restaurant that had a track record, as we didnt want to take a chance on a local-owned shop. I certainly wasnt disappointed. The restaurant is clean, as were the restrooms, and I loved the island theme - it give the place a coastal feel, which is nice if you live in Arizona! I had some kind  of combo burrito that was good sized and gulped down every bite. I was in the restroom when my wife ordered for me, so couldnt comment on the friendliness of the staff."
5,"One of the most memorable breweries Ive been to, not because of their personal beer choices but because of how they run the place. They have over 30 beers on tap from all over the country. If thats not cool enough, the entire back wall of the place is refrigerated coolers full of bottles and cans of even more craft brews that you can hand pick to drink in house...OR....build your own 6 pack to carry out. Brews from all over from Epic, to Dogfish, to Maui Brewing, to Sierra Nevada and the list goes on...and on....and on. It really is a nice concept!! Oh....and their food is great too. Mostly your normal bar food but pretty tasty. As for the service? I was incredibly impressed at how the girls that were serving us really truly seemed to have some serious beer knowledge. They were able to help us pick the right beer for our liking and they were right there when the brews disappeared regardless of the fact the place was packed. Know before you go: Dont let the exterior fool you! Its a small portion of a strip mall...look hard or you may miss it"
3,Sooo...if they ask you if you want to sit in the lounge...just say no! Trust me... Artichoke brushetta is good but garlicky which I like
5,"I love Christmas-time and I especially love it because I know that Luminarias is back and this year its better than ever! The staff and volunteers at the DBG do an excellent job of directing guests through the garden. Between the well-lit paths (with Luminarias of course), helpful staff and amazing acts, this is an event not to be missed! I consider this to be the ultimate activity for adults. Its romantic if youre on a date, its festive if youre with your family and its just pure fun if youre with friends.  You enter the park to be immediately greeted by hundreds of meowganificant Luminarias lighting up the entire garden. Cocktail stations lie in every knook and cranny and they serve delicious festive drinks like my favorite, hot cocoa and raspberry vodka! If youre hungry, they sell food throughout the garden at two locations. Then there are the performers. The DBG does an amazing job of bringing in musicians of every shape and size. Whether its a trio of Christmas carolers, a mariachi band or a lively Jazz band, they have bands in every corner lighting up the night! I am also continuously impressed with the acoustics of the garden. With so many live acts in one area, you can barely hear a specific act until you are in that area. Their event planners did an amazing job!  Luminarias is my favorite Arizona activity during the holidays and I cant wait to go back next year!!"
4,"Cesar Chavez park is the best that the SW Valley has to offer! Located at 35th Ave & Baseline at the base of South Mountain, its a great location for the residents of South Phoenix and Laveen. Ive seen it very busy, but it also seems to be one of the best kept secrets in SW Phoenix! There is ample seating throughout the park, including ramadas and benches. A 1.1 mile trail wraps around the lakes in the center of the park, making it perfect for runners and walkers. There is a small tot lot and playground on the east side of the park that families will enjoy. No matter what time of day you visit the park, you will find people around the lakes fishing. Be careful- a friend once tripped on a fishing line that a careless fisherman didnt remove from the sidewalk and broke his elbow! Drawbacks: this park is always dirty, as no one seems to clean up their trash after visiting and it is not safe in early morning or evening hours. Otherwise, enjoy one of the better city parks!"
4,"It is always nice to find a place that can make just about any dish with tofu as the main protein. This means a vegetarian like me can choose from any dish on the menu.  Despite this flexibility I tend towards the red curry. I get this as hot as they will make it with out an argument ensuing, which is usually pretty decent on the heat scale. It is a great medley of crisp vegetables in a creamy coconut milk base red curry. The tofu is the fried style which adds an interesting textural variety to the standard tofu. The lunch specials come with a small salad, a small soring roll and a little slice of watermelon all in the $7 range.  Service is decent, my water received frequent refills as i tend to drink quite a bit with spicy food.  Parking here can be a bit tight at high times, and there also may be s small wait. If there is a wait go to the liquor next store to find an amazing beer selection."
1,"I dont intend to return, but based on the way we were treated by the kitchen earlier this week, my ""uncouth"" self doesnt exactly feel welcome anyway. However, Im not quite convinced that its my loss...  It had been almost a year since my original visit to Breadfruit which did not overwhelm (as you can judge by it taking me a year to make it back) but I did have an appreciation of the option for Caribbean cuisine.  Since a friend and I were going to be downtown for an event, I suggested Breadfruit for our dinner spot. We enjoy good food and supporting local. The option to pick up wine at the Public Market next door and have the already reasonable corkage fee waived was a bonus, as we had really enjoyed a couple of the Arizona Stronghold wines at a recent FnB wine pairing and thought they would pair well with the Jamaican heat!  While the scallops were delicious and cooked perfectly, 2 for $12.50 -- $6.25 per scallop -- is a tad steep in my book. We also shared the Jerk Chicken Salad ($9.95) and the Jerk Prawns Off the Grill ($14.95).  Heres the ultimate rub, the bottom of the menu states ""no substitutions or modifications""... Since when is cutting a KFC-side-sized ear of corn a ""modification""?  At the same time, the menu describes the restaurant and its offerings as ""Nothing fancy; simply good food that nourishes and rejuvenates the body.""  It seems like cutting something in half so we could easily share it -- particularly after the plate has been delivered to the table for us to appreciate its ""beauty"" AND after weve communicated to our server and demonstrated with the first two courses that we were splitting the items -- is in the vein of ""nothing fancy.""  How about providing the customer with an appropriate utensil to cut it themselves, then?  The fact that the chef was obstinate in refusing to cut the KFC-side-sized ear of corn provided with our entree screams ""pretentious and grandiose"" and tainted our entire experience.  To quote my dinning companion, ""You are not James Beard and James Beard wouldve cut the corn!"""
3,"Had breakfast at Joes Diner this morning.  I had the number 2, and a side of potatoes.  It was supposed to come with 2 bacon and 2 sausage, but for some reason, mine came with four pieces of bacon.  I didnt question it because the waitress seemed a little absent minded and we had to ask for a side that she had already forgotten.  The few times she came to check on us, she would ask if everything was ok and would walk away so fast that we couldnt tell her what we needed.  The positive here is that the pancakes were REALLY tasty.   I would have given Joes 4 stars if the service was better, but I think there could be some improvement there."
4,"As a mom of two, Jasons Deli is awesome.  The ingredients are fresh and healthy, and the kids meals are huge and priced right. For my young kids (4 and 2), one meal is enough for them to share. For bigger kids, it seems they could be eating off the kids meal longer than at some places.  Add speedy delivery of food and free self-serve ice cream at the end, and this is one happy mom!"
4,"The food is good and the location is perfect. A solid breakfast spot in Oldtown. Everything on the menu looks fantastic. I went the healthy route this morning and went with the Quick Start Conscious. 4 egg whites, broccoli, tomato, fruit and cottage cheese. Phenomenal for a healthy breakfast out.   Breakfast club also brews a pretty solid cup of coffee that gives me a pretty good buzz for only having two cups. The only real negative is the outside seating. It seemed good in theory on a cool day in Scottsdale with temperatures only in the seventies. However, being right on Scottsdale Road, it was hard to hear the people I was eating with because of all the passing traffic. Id advise that anyone dining here eat inside (where it unfortunately can also be a little loud since the place is always busy)."
5,"I work right down the street from Press and have been a huge fan from my very first visit! The staff is unbelievably friendly and extremely passionate about their craft! Everything from the food to the coffee is first rate! They always accommodate my special requests (a little more of this, none of that) and always make good suggestions when Im looking for something new.  I love the yogurt and granola parfait (strawberry and vanilla yogurt for me with a bit of honey and light granola) for breakfast with a white chocolate latte. Also, the breakfast burritos are perfectly creative and filling. For lunch, my favorite is the cactus club panini with a small side salad.  Also worth mentioning is that they have the VERY BEST iced coffee around. They call it an iced toddy and any one of the employees would be happy to tell you how it is different from regular coffee. I just know that it tastes amazing and seems to have a bit more of a caffeine kick!   My favorite part about Press are their delectable desserts! The berry mascarpone cake pretty much makes you feel like youve won the lottery. And the ghirardelli brownies and chocolate chip cookies (warmed up) are a weekly addiction of mine.   Starbucks is a thing of the past. Im lucky to be in close proximity to Press, but I think I would even make the drive just for that mascarpone cake!"
3,"I know I enjoy food when I think about how good it was later..like days and days later. It has been about a week and I am still craving the Mac n Cheese I inhaled during my Happy Hour visit. The Macaroni was cooked to perfection, the cheese was the perfect consistency and texture, and the addition of spicy sausage really set the dish apart.  While the service was impossibly slow, every waiter I came in contact with was extremely nice. But nice or not, I was sucking on melted ice for half the night while I waited to get my drinks refilled. No bueno.  The atmosphere was relaxing and casual, and the bathrooms were fabulous!! Well lit, great aroma, and my choice between cloth hand towels or paper. The bathroom had well placed mirrors which made the space feel big and clean. I will definitely come back, but next time I might sneak in my own drink."
4,"Great shopping. Even better people watching! Here you can shop stores ranging from H&M and Pac Sun, to Prada, Gucci, and Louis Vuitton. Its a pretty upscale mall, so most shoppers dress to impress, while other people recognize the fact that it is still JUST a mall, so they dont. That being said, youll never feel out of place, no matter what you show up wearing. I love the valet area the most... its littered with tricked out Bentleys, Lambos, Ferraris, and Aston Martins! I mean, I drive a REALLY nice car, and I would still be ashamed to valet it there! My favorite store is probably Lush! I have a tendency to spend a lot of money in that store!! Sephora is a close second... Im always on the lookout for my next favorite cologne! Fashion Square also boasts some pretty good dining as well! Modern Steak, albeit very pricey serves up a damn good slab of steak. On my next visit Id like to try the Kobe beef hot dog!! Z Tejas, Kona Grill, and the Yard House all offer great happy hour and reverse happy hour deals on food and beverages! All in all, this mall is impeccably clean, very inviting, and fun to shop!"
4,"The place was dope! The only bummer was the half-assed sun cover offerings out on the patio, but we were lucky to find a spot inside for post brunch drinks! Food, service and atmosphere are all good! Definitely make it to this spot!"
4,"Food : Fried. Carbs. Cheese. Yum. Selection: Main specialty and dessert. Sufficient.  Price: Under ten bucks a pop. Great. Parking: Sucks! I nearly died after having to park across the street (no room at the inn) via a running jaywalk across the 7th ave midday madness. However, I dont care. Gluttony is so worth it. Hours are rather limited. Better for me anyway, otherwise Id have to start popping Lipitor because youd probably find me here way too often."
4,"I love eating at Byblos.  The food there is great!  I love their hummus w/meat & pine and their pita bread has always tasted pretty good to me.  The tomato soup is awesome and the rest of their dishes are SO good.  The one waiter everyone is talking about?  Ive never thought he was rude, hes just quiet and old.  Gosh, give him a break!  I dont know how most of these reviewers have never run into the owner.  Hes awesome!  Half the time hes the one who will wait on you and hes super nice and friendly.  Hes always willing to make recommendations.  Sure its not in some upscale neighborhood, but the food is good."
4,"I have been going to Niros for several years.  You can always count on them fulfilling your your order very quickly and with consistently good quality. When I am in a hurry between meetings I can count on Niros to deliver a better experience than I could get at a random fast food joint. The gyros are good, the french fries are hot and crisp and the service is always friendly."
1,"Pure Fitness as a whole I like. No contracts, the people going there are actually there to work out and not to be seen, (ex. LA Fitness). Plus you get complimentary training sessions. However, this location I will NEVER return to and its all because of their new GM Adam. I had a free pass and he was the one that I had been assigned to for my fitness test and 1st training session. I had already explained that I planned to join but he wouldnt stop the full court press of selling which I didnt like at all. I wanted to use my weeks free pass THEN join. He wanted me to give him money right then and there when he hadnt so much as given me a tour yet! Anyway, I told him I wanted to wait and then he starts asking when I get paid, is it a money situation, etc..if made me VERY uncomfortable.  I went ahead with the training session and he knew in advance that Im not inactive but going to the gym is not something Ive done on a consistent basis in a very long time. Now I enjoyed the workout but from what others have told me..he pushed me way to hard for my first time out of the gate. My arms werent sore, I know sore, Im okay with sore but they became weak for FIVE days, that I had trouble sleeping they had that irritable and restless feeling, and it hurt to use a freakin date stamp at work!  But the reason Im not going back..I was surfing them online and saw how easy it was to sign up online so I did. That way I wouldnt have to worry about remembering voided checks etc.  Well I called Adam to let him know and he went off on me.. just short of yelling. ""Great, now I lose the commission the gym loses the points.. you can understand why Im upset right."" and he went on for about 5 minutes. I was stunned at how unprofessional he was and hes the GM??? If they work on commission they should give you a heads up ""hey I know its easy to sign up online but we work on commission so I would appreciate it if you went through me if and when you choose to sign up"". I would have respected that. OR if when you sign up online it allows you to put in the name of the person you have been working with so it doesnt circumvent them. But I was floored and pissed that he came at me like that.  Ps. Of all the Pure Fitness this one is the smallest, visually unappealing and has the worst customer service. I did sign up and I love the one I go to now...but this one I will never step foot in again"
4,"Sprinkles has amazing cupcakes! The cake is always moist and the frosting delicious. I have had cupcakes from other bakeries where they pipe the frosting on using a pastry bag, and there is wayyyyyy too much frosting. Sprinkles does it by hand, so the frosting amount is always perfect for the cake size. I love the simple decorations they use as well. The only downside I have noticed is that they use a lot of oil, and if the cupcake is touching the box the oil will actually seep through the cardboard. But I guess its the price you pay for extremely moist cupcakes! Also, the frosting is super sweet and it sometimes makes my teeth hurt. Its so worth it though! My favorite flavor ever is Chai Latte! They only have them on Fridays though, and they often run out before dinner, so get there early if you want one! They also have amazing seasonal flavors: salty caramel, dark chocolate raspberry, eggnog spice, chocolate peppermint, and the best: brown sugar praline! That one is an Easter flavor and I love the crunch of the praline combined with the brown sugar! YUM! Yes, it is a bit pricey, but if you like the ""Sprinkles Cupcakes"" and ""Sprinkles Cupcakes Scottsdale"" Facebook pages they each do a daily whisper word that will get the first 50 people a free cupcake! I always try to buy another cupcake when I use them, so its about $2 a cupcake then. Many times the whisper word will get you an off-the-menu cupcake, either a seasonal offering from a different part of the year or a cupcake creation. I had a lemon cake with strawberry frosting once, and it tasted like strawberry lemonade...delicious!"
3,"Do to have that ONE review you just keep putting off and dont care to write it? Thats the post office for me. You get what you get, and you get it here. Its like a review of a place that no matter what any of us write, itll never change.  One thing Id LOVE to see, especially once the Snow Birds return... A speed line. Just a basic line for basic transactions. I always use the automatic machines as often as I can, but it always seems the times I have to wait in line, its always out the door and takes forever.  Stick to mornings and late afternoons. Skip on weekends!"
1,"I dont understand how a second restaurant was opened on Tatum . My husband and gave these place too many chances and wach time the food was not impressive. The margaritas come from a stolen recipe from La Pinata Nueva , but too bad they didnt bring the recipes with them. I hope they get it "" that maybe if you put alittle quality in the food people will come back""."
5,Great food!!!  Everything on the menu is good.  The bacon guacamole burger is next to perfection.
4,"Brought my car in to get the electric stuff checked. $25 to do an electronic systems check, then determined it was a bad alternator. I brought my car in at the end of the day, about 5pm or so, and they had it ready by 11am the next day.  The owner/manager, Terry, seemed like a straight up guy. Pricing is fair, as far as I could tell.  They seem to stay pretty busy with normal cars as well as business fleet vehicles. Ive seen school buses there, Topkick-sized trucks, and as well as your standard fare trucks with lawnmowers on the back."
3,Meh.
5,Terrific food and service. Happy hour from 3-6 is totally worth it for the free childrens meals and half price drinks. The french onion burger is delicious!
4,"I havent been here since they renovated but the previous decor was great.  Elegant open areas, great atmosphere. Tried almost everything on the menu with the owners one night and everything was amazing.  Id be there more often if it were closer. They can also do private parties on their outdoor patio, and offer drink/music service."
1,"2nd time messing up our carry out order. Boneless wings have bones and no carrots or celery again!!  Hamburger with only tomato, cheese, and BBQ sauce had onions and lettuce, when we specifically said no lettuce or onion. Allergic to onions and dont like shredded lettuce. Thanks to Tiler for messing up our order again. Will not be back."
4,"Well, if you want California fancy cuisine, this aint your place.  If you are seeking down-home country cookin, this is your spot.  Anyway, there are no Cracker Barrels in California.   The lunches for the two of us were great.  Very good service on a busy day.  Our meals were exactly as ordered (many choices at Cracker Barrel) and the food was hot. The prices are unbelievably reasonable, as inexpensive as a fast food restaurant. The servers are super and extremely courteous and well trained."
5,The perfect burger. Awesome BBQ! NEVER a bad meal!
5,"Toasted subs at their best..   The worst part of eating here is trying to choose one sandwich out of my four or five favorite picks.  And in the fall when they bring out the soups, I can hardly resist ordering the cream corn soup with my meal."
4,"I never used to like Chipotle - pretty much the same way I never used to like gyros, but now I cant get enough! I dont go for the overstuffed burritos - the cleaner and easier to eat burrito bowl is the way to go.  I always get double steak, rice, pinto beans, and the medium tomatillo salsa - best...combo...ever!  I guess I should branch out and try new things on the menu, but I ALWAYS order the same thing from every place I frequent.  Ok - next time Ill try something other than the chicken - since its super bland. The staff are always super helpful - even got a little tip from the cashier once.  If the line is long (as it always is), just step outside, place a phone order, then hop around the line to go pick up your called in order, because she said they make it nearly immediately. ahahah  Ive made an order with my iPhone twice now, and it couldnt be easier. The only reason this place got 4 stars was because even though the steak is awesome most of the time, from time to time its kinda tough - it could be that much better if the meat was a little bit better quality.  Also - the chicken is always dry and lacks flavor."
3,"I tried the shrimp and chips and they were tasty.  The shrimp was a little salty, but with the dipping sauce they tasted fine.  I liked the ""chips"" a lot.  After reading the other review Im nervous to try the fish and chips."
3,"good coffee, friendly staff, good food.  they forgot to bring out the bagel I had ordered, but were very apologetic about it.  I will go here again."
3,"Pretty good food.  The location is kind of scary, for a famous place.  i was a little disappointed in their lunch menu.  i am not a fan of paying $12 for a lunch plate.  i dont need 10 lbs of food at lunch time, but a nice $4-5 plate of food at lunch would be great.  I might return by myself, because the food is very spicy, and most people i hang out with dont like that.  it was even spicy for me and i dont mind that too much."
2,"I used to be an avid shopper/seller at Buffalo Exchange. As I work at a boutique, it was nice that I could bring in brand-name merchandise and get cash for it when I needed it. The majority of the staff knew me and were always very friendly. I dont know if its new managment or new policies but things have definitely changed around there. After yesterdays experience, I will definitely be taking my clothing somewhere else. First of all, the service took way too long. Secondly, the ""buyer trainee"" was unsure on about every single item I had brought in and priced a couple like-new $120-130 tshirts at about $20. The attitude of the staff is quite off-putting and it kind of makes it seem like its such a task. However, they red-haired girl who was working by the fitting rooms was very friendly & helpful. I dont mean to sound like a hater, but as I was quite a loyal customer it was  quite a disappointment, especially in this economic crisis where customer service has never been more important than for those who work in retail."
5,"OMG I love this place!!! Im from Canada and this is ""continentally"" good"
5,Kara is absolutely wonderful! She does a GREAT waxing and I am going to have her do a facial for me very soon.  The atmosphere is very relaxing and Kara is an absolute doll of a person. I would highly recommend her!
2,"Love the charm of the place. I only wish they had a burger that did not taste as if it were boiled. And yes, I tried this place a couple times wanting to like it."
3,"Sometimes you just want to give an A for effort... Or maybe more than three lame stars.  As the two other previous reviewers have pointed out succinctly, the man who I assume to be the owner was extremely nice.  I made the 1.5 hour drive from Tucson to watch Avatar at Arizona Mills, and my friends and I decided to grab a bite before heading back.  We randomly drove down Baseline and pretty much stumbled upon this place.  Traffic going westbound towards the 10 was insane.  I mean it was bumper to bumper past Rural.  Anyway, I ask the guy who I assume is the owner why the traffic was so bad.  At first he didnt know, but then realized that the 60 was closed.  He politely recommended that we head south then cut across to get back to the 10.   I ordered the Jerusalem Falafel sandwich. It was pretty good.  Though, in all honesty, falafel is not one those kind of dishes that one can gush over.  In my opinion, its pretty hard to mess up deep frying ground chickpeas.  I ought to point out that the ingredients were very fresh.  This also applied to the side salad that comes with the combo meal.  My two friends opted for the gyros, and it looked good.  The meat was thinly sliced, which is somewhat different than others Ive had.  They seemed to enjoy the meal, but I dont think they were quite overwhelmed by it either.  In fact, we didnt mention anything about the food during the hour and a half trip back home.   The food is by no means bad at Pita Shack.  Its adequate to serviceable in terms of Mediterranean food.  The positives regarding the food have to be its freshness and price.  In fact, I spent no more than $8 for a sandwich, salad, and drink.  The service, as noted previously, is undoubtedly the most shining spot of the place.   As we were finishing up our meal, the guy who I assume is the owner offered us lentil soup on the house.  We declined after being quite filled and satisfied from our respective sandwiches.  I believe another reviewer had the same thing happen to him, and he had positive comments about it.  Now, for me its was the food that really matters.  Accordingly, I gave three stars, as opposed to the four that I was close to giving.  Should I ever return to the Tempe area hankering for food in a pita, I would most definitely give Pita Shack another shot; if only to support a genuinely nice guys business."
1,"Wish I could rate negative stars.... With so many bar choices this place is by far the worst. Last Saturday a group of friends went out for a friends birthday celebration in Scottsdale and decided if we split up that we would meet at the end of the night at Loco Patron. It was increasingly obvious that the staff was hostile and irritated that they could not close up early. We finished our last call drinks and started to head out. The friend who was celebrating his birthday waited behind at the bar until his friends left the bathroom. At this point two bouncers became extremely agitated at our friend and demanded that he put down his drink and leave. My friend started to explain his reason for not leaving (friends still in bathroom) but was quickly cut off. I watched from the patio as the two bouncers (both obviously larger in height and weight then my friend) quickly escalate from talking to both grabbing my friend under the arms and start to carry him out. As he was carried backwards he lost his balance and tumbled back with both bouncers on top of him. The bouncers slammed him down headfirst on the cement outside of the establishment, pinned him down with their elbows and hit him. At this point I had run behind the bouncers and was yelling at them to get off of him. I had already taken out my phone to call 911 and I quickly tried to take a picture to show that they were using excessive force. We demanded to see the manager at which point the bouncer said he was the manager and refused our request. He swiped my friends phone down out of his hand and broke it on the ground. Several people had called 911 at this point and we waited outside for the police to arrive. The police arrived and took down the bouncers information and stated that they would be recording this incident.  I am absolutely adamant in saying that neither I nor my friends will ever frequent Loco Patron again. We were treated disrespectfully by untrained staff who were either too eager to close up to get home or get a power high by manhandling non threatening, non physical patrons of their establishment. Based on the behavior of the two bouncers I assume that this bar operates without any written guidelines on how bouncers should conduct themselves. What I witnessed was full on assault and an infringement on human rights and I plan on writing any regulatory agency I can think of. These people make a bad name for all of the bouncers out there that conduct themselves within the guidelines of the law."
5,Im giving Yolis 5 stars for the winning combination of great food for a great price at a quaint location. Went there on a Saturday late in the morning and we were seated right away.  Great little hideaway in downtown Chandler.  I ordered the Morning Monte.  It was delicious.  My family ordered various other items and we all sampled a bit off each others plates and everything was excellent.  My favorite item was the chorizo burro.  Excellent chorizo with the correct combination of meats and spices.  The waitress was friendly and we chatted with the owner and she was very nice also. Another really great thing about this place is the prices.  I dont think there are any items above $8 and most meals here are in the $6-$7 range.  Very reasonable for the good quality food you get. After breakfast we took a walk around the courtyard and had a nice time looking around at the plants and exotic birds they have on site.  We also got a chance to meet the owner of the property and she was super nice also.  I will definitely be back to try out some other menu items.
5,"The customer service at this Macys was seriously out of this world. Both my mom and I (who were visiting from out of town; me, San Diego and her, Baltimore) have never ever experienced such friendly and helpful customer service at any department store, anywhere, EVER! We were there late at night- probably for the 2 hours right before closing on a one day sale day. In every single dept. We went (ladies dresses, ladies shoes, mens etc) EVERYONE was soooo nice and helpful. Most of our visit was in ladies dresses. Those reps did everything possible to help us find dresses in different sizes (which can definitely be challenging at the end of a season and at the end of a one day sale when things are haphazardly placed everywhere) and to call other Macys stores when we were unsuccessful in finding a dress at that location in a particular size. Sure, they wanted a sale, but to be so helpful so late at night, right before closing, after a long one day sale was shocking. We must have encountered at least 10 different sales associates while wondering through the store and each and every one was soooo nice and helpful. The selection (at least in womens) was better than most other Macys Ive been to, to boot.  I wish this was my local Macys! Go here- hopefully your experience is just as good as mine :)"
2,"2.5 stars The short: Open and clean setup with friendly staff, but its basically just-ok carby kid food. The long: On the south side of Thomas, just west of 44th St., turning left into the lot can be a bear during peak traffic, but its otherwise fairly accessible for people driving in from the west or walking up, like I did. The inside is wide open and clean with plenty of chairs and tables that were just a little too cluttered around the restaurant floor plan. Otherwise, it doesnt stick out much from other fast food joints. I went during the middle of a somewhat busy lunch period, and who seemed to be the head cashier loudly greeted just about everyone who walked in the front door on the other side of the restaurant. My cashier was friendly and quick, though he seemed a tiny bit frazzled by the small rush.  I ordered The Box combo and a lemonade to go and headed back to my office a short 5-minute walk away. I hoped the freshly squeeze lemonade would be awesome, even if they did charge only about a dime more than fountain drinks for a regular. Although I could taste the lemon, the drink was so sweet, it may as well have been from a mix or carton. The Box comes with a small container of sweet coleslaw dressed in a lot of mayo, a slab of soft-in-the-inside, perfectly browned-on-the-outside toast, somewhat slightly crisp, thin crinkle cut fries, a container of Cane sauce (which tastes like burger sauce), and, of course, four chicken strips. Unless youre me and you get only three chicken strips . . . or two smallish chicken strips and one big chicken strip that maybe they counted as two, but really, halfway through the meal, youre so carbed-out full that you dont miss anything aside from the extra dollar you paid for that extra chicken strip. The strips were fine. It was real chicken, and true to advertising, it was fresh. Sort of crispy, but not as crispy as Id hoped, or even expected. Tender and moist enough to not be bad. But not special. All of it was pretty one-note. I cant even tell you what part of the meal I liked best . . . maybe the toast. Coincidentally, every time I took a bite of that toast, Id think, ""This is the most random slice of toast ever. Whats it even doing here?""  So, its fine if youre like me and want to try every new eatery that opens near my home or office and appreciate the novelty of places like this, but personally, I wont be making a return visit. Edit: I almost threw my drink cup away before I noticed the giveaway pull tab on it--I won a free slice os Texas toast! How do you like them apples? =)"
3,"Stadium was REALLY nice... the MORONS in control of the parking...not so much.  I understand that youre not going to get doctors/lawyers/rocket scientists to control parking and move traffic in and out of the game.  HOWEVER, it would be nice if Glendale would pull their heads out of their butts and build a new on/off ramp for the stadium.  It took over 30mins to get out of the parking lot!!  To make it worse..the Cards lost :("
4,Had the enchiladas - cheese and shredded beef - and some mini chimichangas which were both good. Salsa is fresh and tasty. Friendly service. Will be back next time Im in Florence!
5,"A great little spot to find! Fresh, Fresh, Fresh Sushi and great eats! Be sure to try the green bean appetizer!"
5,"Ive only been here once, for breakfast, but I was very impressed and hope to make it back again soon!"
2,"The service was excellent and the location was great in Old Scottsdale.  For the price, I was shocked at the small portions of food, although nicely presented.  Im not a big eater, but after we ate an over-priced dinner, appetizer portions, we had to go elsewhere to eat."
5,"After unsuccessfully attempting a walk in gel at the posh looking ""Sundrops"" nail salon with my two year old in tow, I was drawn to a half deserted strip mall just down the street and a small space in the center labeled Andys Nails. I Yelped the place and saw the decent reviews so I walked in and was immediately attended to by the friendliest faces Ive seen in a while. Despite the fact that I was short one babysitter, they began work on my nails right away and when my toddler got restless, one of the very nice owners picked her up and carried her around for 20 minutes!  Not only do they now offer Gelish gel manicures but they offer more colors than many other Arcadia/Biltmore/Camelback Corridor nail salons AND theyre cheaper by anywhere from $5-$20! Im definitely going back and going back soon! My toes are lonely..."
4,"Had an opportunity to take our Canadian guests to Aiellos for supper on the weekend.  It was a a moderate drive but we were not disappointed.  We were rewarded with pleasant surroundings, attentive service and good food.  The complementary hot pepper starter was unusual and tasty when coupled with the fresh bread.  The Mushroom Ravioli Special was especially enjoyed by my spouse and the other entrees brought favorable reviews from our guests.  All in all an enjoyable dining experience."
4,"We like this restaurant,  It is always good food and good service and convenient to our home."
4,"This is now Amore Sports Grill. Try the sausage & peppers, they are to die for."
2,"I love German food, and as far as the food went at Bavarian Point, they had some good eats. The *only* reason Im giving the restaurant two stars instead of one is the food. Their rindsroulade was very good, and the red cabbage and spaetzle were excellent. But the quality of the food was undercut by the poor service. It was bad enough that I wouldnt return, and certainly wouldnt recommend it to anyone else. As others have noted, there was no-one to greet or seat us -- not even a sign saying ""seat yourself"". Our waitress took a LONG time to make it to our table to take our drink orders, and when she did, she was complaining about something and looked put-out in general. When my wife ordered a beer, the waitress told her that it would be more expensive because it wasnt available on tap. Now, that could be useful information, but the manner in which she told my wife was defiant rather than helpful. Believe me, we gave her no reason to be so sour --  it was clear that this particular waitress was clearly unhappy -- whether with her job or life, its hard to say. Its too bad, really, because the food *was* good. But why would anyone want to eat at a restaurant whose workers are either nowhere to be found, or miserable? Not me."
4,"Great service !!! Food was good, not spectacular, but very good. They had some crative rolls and a few really good appetizers. Cool little spot that kinda hides in a non descript spot , I will certainly be back if I get a chance before leaving town"
4,Lash Extensions by Cher here are AMAZING  _Affordable.  _She listens to your every wish for the final product.  _Very friendly.  _Accommodating evening appointments.  _Reasonable amount of time to complete.  _She is pretty busy so make appt in advance.  I wouldnt go anywhere but here for lash extensions!  Cher is the greatest =)  aaand no I am absolutely NOT Cher haha just one of her very satisfied customers.
4,"Southern hospitality? Yes maam (or Mister)  :) The first thing that struck me was that my server had a lovely accent.  My daughter looked at me & asked me if it was part of her job to fake an accent,,,, I went with no. Im not sure where its from, but its a honey & yall accent :D She had a very friendly disposition & made our lunch experience a pleasure. She made her mama proud.  The food was decent AND you can have breakfast all day. I love having breakfast for dinner, so thats a big selling point to me :) The building is fairly new, not too brightly lit & clean.  In all honesty I would have given them an A OK rating, 3 stars, but our server pushed them to a yay! Im a fan, 4 star rating.  Good people make the difference!"
5,"The bar and wait staff couldnt be better at this location of PF Changs.  The food and service is better than any other Changs country-wide.  We just moved here from NY and missed our ""local hangout"".  The bar tenders and wait staff have made us feel at home.  We go at least once per week for wonder food, drink, and company with the staff and other patrons.  Thank you Clint, Gerry, Nate, Kyle, Nick, Angie, et al."
4,"I know that all Melting Pot locations gets mixed reviews... usually the price turns people off.  It is a little pricey, but its all about the experience.  Also, since its a time-consuming experience, one tends to be there about twice as long as at a regular restaurant.  So I dont really mind the price for a once in a while kind of thing.  My hubbie and I have been 8-10 times... twice at the Scottsdale location. The husband and I always order the ""Big Night Out,"" generally the ""Lobster Indulgence.""  (We figure if were going to spend a pretty penny, we might as well really make it worthwhile.)  Maybe since we always do the lobster thing, the price doesnt bother me as much. Dont remember the specific themes the times we went to Scottsdale, but the ""Big Night Out"" meals go like this:  Cheese Fondue (you can choose the special or any from the regular menu) with assorted dippers, Salad Course (again, the special or off the menu), Main Course (if you get the ""Lobster Indulgence,"" it includes twin lobster tails, usually a couple kinds of beef (e.g., filet and sirloin), shrimp, chicken, salmon, and/or pork, often a stuffed pasta, and lost of vegetables) with assorted sauces, and the best part... Chocolate Fondue with fresh fruit, brownies, marshmallows, Rice Krispies Treats, etc.  Yummy! I must say that your experience also really depends on your server.  If you get a bogus one, you might not have a great time.  Weve had good experiences for the most part, some absolutely awesome experiences. Also, check out each locations web site prior to making reservations.  They sometimes offer really great deals or promos, especially on weekdays.  This info might be helpful to those who feel like the regular price is over the top."
5,"Wow! Food was great! But the service was even better!!! We got there early so we didnt have to wait a long time.   Their computer system was down, so instead of asking for cash or taking our card numbers, they comped out lunch. So impressed with this place! And such a cool vibe!"
2,"Im really getting ready to give up on this place......or boycott it a while. Whats up!? It feels like its a confused sushi restaurant. WHY THE HECK is the music always blarring?! You can t even hear the person sitting next to you. Are you a restaurant or a club? Do you have servers or visual fluffers? And if you go at Happy Hour, expect to wait 45min to even get your food.  *Are there authentic sushi makers there?????"
4,"We absolutely love this place! When we get out for date night, this is where we go. The waitstaff are great and the food is delicious. I always have a hard time deciding what to get because we love it all....from the fried okra to the jambalaya...If youre in the area this place is definitely worth checking out."
4,Really nice jumping point for a good night in Phoenix. Crab Cake Sandwich was great!
3,"nice location , good service but a little slow. been here twice so far and both times the food i would give 4 stars but both times they screwed up our orders and burger was cold, they did take off 20 percent for the issue and that was nice.. overall i enjoy the food and would go back."
4,"Everyone knows about Pei Wei right?! I really thought so until my boyfriend admitted that he had never been. Challenge accepted.  Now, Ive been a frequent Pei Wei customer ever since I discovered Asian food did not always have to send to you running to the restroom. (Yeah, thanks for nothing Bing Heng and Great Wall Buffet). This isnt the best Asian food ever, but it is quick, accessible, and always pretty tasty.  Ive tried everything on the menu, but my favorite options are the Crab Wontons and the Pei Wei Spicy Chicken. I ordered these plus the Spicy Korean for my n00b boyfriend to try, and everything went better than expected.  In fact, he even commented that the place was ""classier"" than he expected.  Just a side note: you can order and pay online, so you dont have to wait for the takeout line. You can also choose the specific time you would like to pick up your food."
4,"I am really surprised by the previous reviews here. This has been at the airport for many years now.  There is a lot of other places for food, and this is one of the BEST! They have a huge menu, i think and you can even get breakfast. The prices have even gone down. You can get a full meal for under $6.00. That is a screaming deal at Sky Harbor airport. Hard to choose a favorite, but Chicken Delight is really good!! With red or green sause.   Their Salsa is excellent as well. We sometimes get it to go, when through with a trip for our journey home. Hey then you dont have to cook!"
4,"This place is a little more fancy than I expected....decor and atmosphere-wise...I thought it would be plain and simple like Red Lobster but actually the place has a very southern homey feeling to it.....although a seafood place they had like deer heads hanging and other sorts of weird decor.    Came here for dinner yesterday night with my bf and his apartment-mate...we got a table right away but even for a weekday they were still half a full house. The first thing I saw on their menu was the Crispy Alligator appetizer. ALLIGATOR! ooooh but then I wanted to try their oyster appetizers cause they sound good too....ahhhhhh their menu is full of yummy choices! It was difficult deciding what I wanted to get...but after much debate....my bf and I decided to order the Oyster Duo appetizer and share the Pappadeaux Platter -- which is an amazing sample platter of all the fried variety they offer on the fried seafood section of their menu.  So the Oysters Duo -- comes with 3 oysters on half shell baked with a parmesan romano cheese sauce and 3 oysters on half shell topped with crabmeat, spinach and drizzled with Hollandaise sauce. -- oooh they were both delicious however I recommend the later one more just cause its very unique to this restaurant. I got to also try a few pieces of the Crispy Fried Alligator from our friends Appetizer Trio Platter - It was pretty good actually tastes like chicken...but surprisingly more tender - I was thinking alligator meat would be tough and rough but not at all....I wouldnt have known its alligator meat if you didnt tell me. But now I can say I have had alligator meat! The Pappadeaux Platter was pretty good - everything is well  -- fried! However I like the blue crab cake the most, the mini fried crawfish (kind of like popcorn shrimp) is second best however I have to say that the fried Tilapia was a disappointment because it was sadly bland and really dry...it was the only thing I didnt like on the platter. but everything else was good. - - I even tried their watermelon lemonade and it was super refreshing! I was really excited for dessert cause I saw them carrying around a platter of sample of the desserts that they have...so when we were ready for dessert I was excited to see the dessert platter - unfortunately there was nothing on the dessert platter I wanted because they all looked really rich and sweet....such as their sweet potato pecan pie, key lime pie, praline cheesecake, praline bread pudding souffle or turtle fudge brownie was just too much even for the eyes..lol They were also massive in portions so I decided not to have any.  The service was really good, our waitress was pretty quick and friendly. Overall I enjoyed the most of the food (except the fried tilapia) and the service is good so it earned its four stars. :)"
4,"I recently visited the Arizona Science Center, & today came to check this one out, joined by Mike C.  Ok, its not the same thing, but Id say this one rules!  Theres plenty to see here, Its fun for both adults & kids.  A couple of the excellent features are an old MINE to go through, & lots of DINOSAURS!!    :-)) The walkways kind of wind all over the place, so try to keep track of where youve been, & not miss anything.  Theyve put a lot of work into this museum, & youre going to like it! Open Tue thru Fri 10-5, Sat 11-5, Sun 1-5, Closed Monday. Adults:  $10 Kids 3-12:  $6 Students 13+ with ID:  $8 Seniors 65+:  $9"
5,"I love the clothes and accessories, the staff is friendly and the prices accomodate everyone!"
2,"So, yesterday morning, I actually had a prego craving.  I was in the mood for a smoothie for breakfast.  My traditional early morning oatmeal or yogurt breakfast was not going to do.  Baby wanted something else.   I head on over to this Jack-in-the Box, which is close to work.  I pull up, order my strawberry banana smoothie, and am promptly told that the ""machine is broken"".  Uh...well that sucks!  I pull up to the window and the person tells me that the machine is leaking (at least I think thats what he said).  But would be about 10 minutes and it would be up and running.   Now knowing the smoothie issues I had this morning, I dont think that the machine was broken.  The product just wasnt ready yet."
4,Some hits and some misses. Hits : bruschetta and salads Misses: Pizzas other then the margherita (luckily though I got the scrumptious tomato and mozzarella pizza) Great service and pretty good food.
5,"Cant wait to go here again. Had the shrimp po-boy and some homemade banana pudding. Ill write more as I try different things on the menu, but what I did have was delicious."
4,i liked this place. small inside located inside old town glendale so it looks sorta cute food was gooood! got the sampler combo cause i didnt know what to get and the cheese and potatoes pierogi were yummm!! recommended!
2,"Happened to be at the mall around 6:30pm and decided to go to ZTejas for dinner. It was a 25 min wait. Looked across the way and saw lots of open tables at Kona Grill. That ought to have registered as a red flag but since I was starving I guess my mental acuity was off. The hostess sat us in the back of the restaurant with a clear view of the hallway leading to the restrooms. We commented to our hostess that we were awful close to the restrooms. She chirped, yeah. End of discussion. I ordered a grey goose on the rocks, you know, vodka and ice in a glass. What I got back wasnt grey goose and it was mixed with soda, but it was in a glass though. My wife ordered a rib eye sandwich, medium. What she got was still breathing. My Korean chicken was almost warm but I attribute most of that to the spices. It was good but not great. I will say that our server was terrific and the manager did come by to check on us. This used to be a good spot but seems to be going through a transition period to become mediocre. Too bad."
2,"The Beer is good, most of the food is ok, but I have a big issue with BJs.  They advertise their pizza as Chicago style deep dish.  When you order one, youll know right away why there isnt a single location of this chain in Illinois.  The Pizza is more like something Id expect to have ordered at Pizza Hut than anything Ive had growing up in Chicago. Have a beer here before seeing a movie next door.  Other than that, theres way better places to eat in and around Chandler Fashion Center Mall."
4,This is probably one of my favorite spots in Oldtown.  I definitely enjoy the the Thai food here and plus the atmosphere is really chill and homey.  Service was never a problem here every time I go.  My favorite is the Basil Crispy CK....so simple to make but I love it.  Date place? Sure why not :)
5,"Gourmet markets, to me, are like candy shops to a sugar freak. ""Hello, my name is Thomas. And I am a FoodAholic."" There I said it. Do you feel better. Huh? Oh. Sorry. Didnt mean to get so defensive. But how can you defend AJs? How? How I ask you? Ok, so its REALLY expensive. And, yes, they should provide a blood donor center at the entrance to give cash on the spot for shoppers plasma. I HATE huge markets. Frys too big. Safeway just right. AJs just right and then some. The produce section is perfection. Not mounds and mounds of produce you know is wrinkling and rotting more than Bea Arthur in season 6 of the Golden Girls. Cute little baskets hold just enough fruit and veggies to select from and not too much where you know its all riddled with germs and spiddle. The meats and cheeses? Oh, my! The filet (at a whopping $34.99 a pound) is worth every bite. Of course itll be a year or so when I would pay that much again. Hello? Blood donation station idea! The ready made food is dee lish...curry chicken salad and brocolli delight to name two. Yes, it s called brocolli delight. My gay ass did not name it. I would have called it beautiful broccoli. Just rolls off the tongue better. Ive never had a cart wobble...see Frys review...they ride smooth and apparently are good for the enviornment. Flowers, baked goods, dishes....AJs. Its here. Im queer. Get used to it."
3,"My parents love pho so Ive practically been enjoying Vietnamese cuisine since the womb. Ha! No wonder I love it so much myself that it was always on the weekly dinner rotation when I lived in OC. Alas, I moved to North Phoenix and I dont have little pho shops or boba cafes on every street corner. Ive learned that I have to drive a ways to Chandler/Mesa to satisfy these cravings. Imagine my surprise when the husband and I noticed Tea Lite Cafe when we changed up our movie theater location this past weekend. Of course, we had to try it out and wed been dying for some pho for months now. We both ordered the beef pho and took a seat. The place is small but theres plenty of seating and still feels spacious. The cashier up front was super friendly and welcoming which was nice. We didnt have to wait too long for our food to arrive...another plus.  The pho itself has really tasty broth and the beef was nice and tender. I was disappointed by the small portion of bean sprouts, mint leaves and limes that accompanied the soup. Im used to overflowing plates of these veggies so I can load up my soup to my hearts desire. In fact, my hubby usually counts on me doing this since I end up eating all my veggies and leaving most of the beef for him. Double ha! But the lack of sprouts and mint leaves didnt put a damper on the great taste of the pho. What I did miss was the traditional pho ingredients like tripe, rare steak and tendons. I know, I know...sounds intense but trust me it makes pho taste soooo good. I guess I just have a usual when it comes to pho so I was a little disappointed when I couldnt satisfy my craving to the utmost degree. Woe is me.  But let me conclude by stating again that the pho here is really good and has a great flavor to the broth. I think the hubby and I will go back since it is so conveniently located to us. Itll definitely do in a pinch although I am sure I will occasionally find myself making the trek to get me some tripe!"
5,"Hip hop sandwich shop.  Not a traditional dining experience.  Food was great, and prices were very great.  Everything on menu was under $10.  Mac and Cheese is worth ordering as an appetizer, and the BLT was rediculously delicious.  I look forward to going back again, and probably again."
5,Bring a flashlight. It is so dark inside you can not read the menu. But the waiter was so well versed we just used his recommendations.  We all had filets cooked to perfection and served on a 400 degree hot plate. They recommend the lobster mashed potatoes but did not feel they were worth the price tag. The wine list is extensive and expensive.  If you are looking for fancy this is the place but we went after a round of golf and they were very accommodating .  Great special occasion dinner but not your everyday steak joint .
1,This place has the oiliest food Ive ever eaten in my life.  I had carry out one evening (two dishes) and the entrees were soaked in oil.  I had to rinse with water my eggplant dish three times just to eat it without feeling sick to my stomach.  I wish I couldve washed the other dish too (but it wasnt one that could be washed--it was a wide-rice noodle dish). Can definitely taste the MSG in these dishes too. Really not sure what the fuss is about.
4,"More expensive than some of the other nearby locations ($5 military lot next door) The shuttle was nice and quick shuttle despite odd hours of the night. Nice enough, they also accepted competitor coupons when the lot with the deal was full. The boyfriend and I had a great experience and prompt service at all hours of the night. It also seems more secure. Loved it!"
1,"Just because this place is called ""Maria Maria"" doesnt mean they sell Mexican food. Their menu actually says ""Mexican inspired cuisine"" which should have been my clue to leave. The food is border line Nasty!   The restaurant is cute and sort of romantic but its so loud in there that it ruins the ""romantic"" mood. I was excited to see they had live music until they started playing some weird pop music. Why would they do that in a ""Mexican"" restaurant?  I wanted to leave but our waitress was no where to be found 20minutes after we finished our meal. I dont recommend this place for any meal!   I have only been living in Scottsdale for two months but it seem that Arizona is ""Cougar"" town. The bar was full of them. Im beyond annoyed with all this ladies acting like they are 21 wherever I go. Im embarrassed for them. They dress and act young but with that face and hands who are they kidding besides themselves? gee."
3,"Well, it dropped a star for me, and Ill tell you why. Eaten there probably 20 time in the last quarter. Ive had it all; All you can eat sushi, bowls, desert, beer. Ate alone, ate with Sandra K, ate with son and family (including 3 year old grandson who plays drums with the chopsticks) had a party of 12 there. Service....slow on Saturday for the AYES, otherwise I cant complain. There are some ""bright"" spots. First, its close to my neighborhood, a start and there is more than sushi and that is helpful when you have non-sushi lovers with you. The bowls are very good and you can order them in the heat index you like. Funny names to them as well, like the ""Exit Wound Bowl"" or ""The Classified Bowl with this description;Dont Order this Bowl"". Squid Salad is great, great, great! Calamari, ok. Hey they put a lot of thought into their beer selection and that is cool. And their dessert sushis are very unique. As for the sushi....I now have way too many sushi restaurants to try and they are all falling over themselves for your business. Sushi has become really ""hip"" lately but there will be a fall out in this category as the economy continues to slow and people, lets face it, are pulling back. This is not a place for a sushi purist, but give me good food, a cool gathering place (close to my central Phoenix abode) and I will be there. Sushi has got to get better for me to rate higher and ""earn"" my business."
4,"I love this place, so cute and trendy, and great food! love the crepes but my fav is the BBQ pork sandwich. its so flavorful with avocado. Pastries are great too. Great place for lunch or afternoon tea."
4,"Great place. Sushi was not wrapped up tied enough so it tended to fall apart. Also the roll was a bit thick that it is hard to fit it in your mouth (yeah, thats what she said:)"
1,"Sadly, Im giving this place one star and an explanation why it is only getting one star.  The Manger/operator guy. Sure, the food here isnt all that bad.  Probably a half a notch or so higher than most of the hot slop fast food you can get for lunch.  Most of the crew members are pretty attentive, dont seem to be meth addicted, and I see them cleaning the tables on a regular basis.  Looks like the crew changes over quite often, and I know why. My beef is not with the crew members, oh no.  Not with the food or cleanliness of the store.  Nope.  The Manager guy, the guy who looks like a real pussy version of John Leguizamo.  This guy ruins about every trip I have to this joint.  That is my problem with this joint.  Elaboration will proceed now. This guy is without a doubt one of the biggest assholes I have ever encountered in the fast food industry.  Actually, one of the biggest assholes period.  What a douche bag.  Seems like any time I have a coupon, this guy will literally butt in the middle of the order, give me a ration of shit and do about anything possible not to use it.  Seriously, what is it, 30 cents?  I had a store coupon that was on a tray liner a while ago and this nutsack got in the middle of the order, cancelled it and refused to let the coupon be used.  I asked why and he said it was not legit (why was it on the tray liner then fuckhead?) I checked the menu, they would have lost 10 cents.  Lady taking my order after P.J.L. (pussy John Leguizamo) walked away pretty embarassed said ""sorry""  Not her fault.  Never saw her working there after then, was probably tired of that guys shit.  I dont blame you. Last trip here, they have promos on their drink cups for free shit.  Awesome.  We all know this is the garbage that costs them nothing but I am a sucker for something free.  On my trip before the last, I got one for a free corndog.  SCORE!  I cash it in on my last trip, and the guy ringing up the order said it would be on a different ticket.  No sweat, I could give a shit less as long as I get my corndog.  Go to get my order, ask where the corndog is.  P.J.L. butts in the middle of the order, says ""This is your order, this is what you have"" and was a fucking prick about it.  Me, the customer.  Yanks the receipt out of my hand, gives me an attitude about it.  Who the fuck talks to a customer like that, even at a low rent fast food joint?  Fuck you.  Seriously.  The guy who took my order tried to explain the situation and dicknose literally looks at him, puts his hand in front of the guys face, and says ""ssssshhhhhh"" and snaps his fingers the same way I do to my dogs to keep them barking or eating drywall.  Who degrades their employees like that?  All he was trying to do was explain my free item was on another ticket.  Instead of listening, he made a complete asshat out of himself.  It was a corndog, what does that cost you anyway, about 12 cents in batter, a stick, and a combination of horse eyeballs and badger penis meat?   Dude (cashier guy, tattoo on your arm), tell that guy to get fucked and get a better job.  No one deserves that shit.  I am actually ashamed I didnt say something for you, I truly am. What would have normally gotten a decent review is what it is.  My rant speaks for itself.  One shithead ruins it for the ones working for him.  For the ones working there, I will pray for you.  You need it.  P.J.L., get out of there and become a pimp in Tijuana, they need midget controlling assholes over there.  You would do great at that."
3,"For a pretty yuppie place, Desert Ridge has a decent enough assortment of shops, assuming of course you can find them.  Sure, you can theoretically pick up some new accents for your living room, a new pair of shoes, some books and the materials to make new candle rings in one go after which you involve yourself with movies and a beer, but you may give up in frustration before you ever find a place to park. I dearly hope whoever laid this place out is no longer in charge of such projects.  There is no logic whatsoever to the layout.  Trying to drive between the lots can verge on nightmarish.  Needlessly huge islands in the parking lot put leaves in the way of ever finding whats across the way, so navigating the place on foot is often out of the question without even taking the Phoenix summer heat and wretched drivers into consideration. Desert Ridge probably isnt going anywhere.  Ive never been there that it wasnt busy.  Its almost impossible to avoid if you have any significant shopping to do.  But, the restaurants here dont tend to last long.  They come and go before Yelp can ever get to them, leaving an endless strand of big box outlets and bastions of poor fashion sense."
4,"I really expected crappy food, because, after all, thats what sports bars generally offer.  Then I was told that the food was not bad, but good!  Which only made me eye my table mates suspiciously.  I ordered the tacos al carbon which comes with cilantro lime rice.  these are three street taco sized dealies that have steak in them and come with a little shot of pico and queso. Now like I said, I expected crap.  But the tacos, with pico and queso poured on them, and grease dribbling out into a glorious puddle on the plate, were really amazingly good.  The steak bits were really tender--ordinarily in such a taco theyd be the tenderness of jerky.  Really: the tacos were totally sensational. Also, we ordered a buffalo chicken flatbread which is essentially a pizza.  And it was great!  even with the bleu cheese, which I detest, this was a culinary delight. So why the four stars, you ask?  two reasons.  One: the cilantro lime rice is offensively bad, like straight out of a box of rice-a-roni bad.  I would have preferred kibbles and bits as a side item. And one other thing: it was happy hour and for a while they were serving beer OUT OF PITCHERS THAT WERE IN THE REFRIGERATOR INSTEAD OF STRAIGHT OUT OF THE TAP!  Capital crime.  Felonious.  In fact, Dante wrote about a circle of hell where all they did was serve beer out of pitchers instead of straight from the tap. So you should know that although the beer serving would usually be a four star deduction and Id never look back, I didnt drink beer tonight and so I really dont care if my table mates suffer.  But if you try that shit on me... Four stars.  The food is really damn good."
4,"Fun Fun Fun!  If youre looking for some fun for your kids or you just need to get out some stress yourself, come here.  Enjoy the adrenaline release you can get by shooting at other people in a dark maze with your laser gun while trying not to get shot yourself. This place is great. :)"
2,"Was it worth the 21$ for a salad and small pizza? Absolutely not! Bad service. Maybe the guys grandma died I dont know. I want to tell you what really made me mad about the experience. We order the small pizza and salad and the guys could have cared less and took our $ and we sat down. We were looking around and hmm, theres a sign saying ""x large pizza and large salad only 23$"". Wow that would have been nice if the guy told us that. I left hungry, mad and unsatisfied.  To the owner: teach your employees the value of upselling and telling the specials. Something so small can affect a customers experience negatively.  And your salads are severely overpriced  Wont go back unless Im desperate."
5,"I love their food. Everything has been delicious, though my favorite is ""Bahn Mi"" inspired fish sandwich. Get it with a side of kale salad!"
4,"Yummy, this place is great. Good burgers and you get to choose everything yourself the meat the cheese what type of sauce or veggies you want. Your not tied to a box at this place and it shows the meats are all fresh and the cheese and veggies are all top quality. I recently ate here with my family and at first thought it was a little expensive about 11.00 a burger after cheese and stuff. My personal burger was like $15.00 after I got kobe beef and horseradish cheese but the burger was very good. After thinking about it for a while it dawned on me that a Whopper is like 6 dollars and this was easily 3 to 4 times better then a Whopper. I recommend it if your looking for a good burger all natural no hormones and an entire gluten free menu."
3,"In addition to the nice atmosphere on the patio they serve a very nice brunch menu and the $2 bloody marys are a buy. Downside: parking validation is only a discount, not a freebie. Depending on when you go the service can be slow. During a recent happy hour the barmaid herself was left to tend to all bar patrons and the patio."
3,A bit slow for an airport setting and the staff were blaming each other for an order gone wrong for the customer in front of me...tacky.
3,"I reeeeaaalllyyyyy wish that I could give this a 4, but I cant do that in good conscience.  The food was great, but the service was downright abysmal. In a fit of random adventurousness, I thought it would be fun to try a new kind of food for me.  Im typically a weenie and afraid of anything ""weird"" so this is a big deal for me.  We drove out here on Friday night and at around 6 or so the restaurant was about half full.  We stood at the door for entirely too long while we waited to be seated.  When we were at our table, we waited entirely too long to get menus.  When we knew what we wanted, we waited entirely too long to place our order.  You get the idea.  Thankfully the food came out fairly quickly.   I ordered the vegetarian plate that had collard greens, some kind of cabbage/carrot/potato thing, red lentils, and some bean/carrot/onion thing.  As with all dishes, it was served with the injera, a weird sourdough crepe thing.  I was a little weirded out that the bread thing was served cold, but I got used to it quickly enough.  Everything on my plate was yummy, but if I were to rank it, my favorite would be the lentils, followed by the collard greens, then the potato, then the carrot/bean thing.   Eating here was a fun experience for sure, and not having any silverware definitely made for some creative feeding procedures.  I would probably come back here if the mood for Ethiopian food struck me again, but I would really hope that the service would be better.  Since everyone else mentions great service, I am going to assume we came at an ""off"" time."
4,"Los Olivos is a quiet resturaunt in the Old Scottsdale city near the SF Giants spring training site. That is how I happened on this wonderful family style eatery. Arrived to the area to meet a Good HS friend and was way early. Used the Yelp app on my phone and soon I was here! Seated with out any wait. The place was just picking up since the ball game was not to far off and it was Dinner time as well. Service was very efficient and pleasant. Im partial to Chicken what ever in these Mexican style resturaunts, and had a Chimi. Arrived shortly and enjoyed it emencely. I would recomend Los Olivos to anyone. Looks as if they can handle most any size group as well! Everything is reasonably priced as well. Enjoy! Holla!"
5,The praise and worship with Pastor BJ just sets up a God Filled service with the charismatic and awesome Pastor Maiden ... Going the Past 18 months has made our Marriage Stronger and Faith Magical
4,"Love their salad bar, so much to eat, not as much as sweet tomatoes but good nevertheless! Only suggestion would b if they can get the labels on foods, bcs for people like me who dont eat meat its very difficult to figure out that theres tuna in one of their salads without a label! I almost ate it, so I hope they take this into account! My best is the whole boiled eggs though :)"
4,"I went on a Friday night after work with 3 of my girlfriends.  It was raining, cold, and we were HUNGRY!  Got a good spot right across from the front door, very surprised.  The parking lot was parked with cars.  Must be our lucky night!  Found a table on the other side of the bar, where the music was blasting.  It was still all good!   We ordered:  Rosies Chili Con Quezo Dip, Patricks Irish Potato Skins, Jimkys Famous Chicken Wings Mild, Quigleys Quesadilla, Rosies ""World Famous"" Pulled Pork Sandwich, Corned Beef & Cabbage, & Sweet Potato Fries.  And of course drinks!!!  Yes, our eyes are bigger than our stomaches.  The waitress warn us that it is ALOT of food. The girls said the drinks were weak, but I only had ice tea.  All the food was great!  The service was wonderful.  She was very nice!   Loved the central location and the pub atmosphere!"
2,"I really like this concept for a quick breakfast/brunch spot, but the execution wasnt too delicious. If you know me well enough, youll know my first thought when we walked in was ""is there booze???"" The answer is yes. I recall seeing your typical breakfast bevies such as mimosas, bellinis, bloody marys, etc. So you go in, scope out the menu, order at the counter, and they bring you your meal and beverages. I ordered a simple eggs, potatoes, toast and sausage breakfast, and my friend had an omelette. We had just had brunch at Maizies the day prior and our first impression was disappointment in the portions of the food, considering the prices were also comparable. Oddly, my sausage, potatoes and sunny side eggs had the same consistency, so that was off for me. They were all a bit soft and soggy. We, of course, enjoyed the mimosa and bellini, but $5 each is a bit high considering theyre $3 @ at other places, and Cafe Boa down the block offers unlimited mimosas for a fixed fee with food.  I thought the location was great, and the Sunday brunch crowd was nice. Im not sure what it will be like when the students come back, but I dont think I would be back to find out."
5,"So. After 8 years of owning a Ford, it left me stranded on the road one to many times.  So I bought a 06 Hyundai Elentra (from a different location). Ive never owned a foreign car, this car appealed to me because of the low miles and still had a warranty.  Well....it started to act a little funny. So I called up Discover Hyundai, as they are miles from my work. I spoke to Tim in the service department and he was more then helpful.  They had to keep the car for 2 days, because they couldnt get it to do what I was telling them it was doing...but they were persistent and finally were able to duplicate my issue.  Everything was under my warranty. I was back on the road by the end of day 2!  I will for sure be going back here for all normal maintenance and if any other issues arise. Thanks Tim!"
3,"My husband and I both rate this a 3. Food was good, but not great. Fresh veggies and nice flavors. Dont know if bread is made in house. The bread on my sandwich was falling apart, which made it difficult to enjoy.  I think the owner or manager was there, and I expected him to be introducing himself or welcoming us in some way,  but he seemed to be hard at work. I think as a new business, it would be a good idea to be more welcoming to people who are willing to try something new. Also,  there was a girl working there with a really dirty apron and she cussed while we were ordering. Very unprofessional and unsanitary, especially if the owner was there. Also,  wish they had a soup without a cream based broth. Maybe wed try again for b reakfast?"
4,"Not that my review will mean much given the more in-depth reviewers but I will chime in nonetheless... I can really only review one dish, the #3 lunch special, Yellow Curry Chicken. I dont know what the authentic name for it is, Kang Karee something or other. Its so tasty that the first time I had it I knew Id never branch out. Good lunch spot if you work around downtown. Not the quickest service all the time and can get busy during lunch, but always consistently good. Fairly dim inside, a good place to forget about the sun on a summer day."
3,"So I started getting a cold yesterday and wanted some more soup it was late already 8pm so hunny went off on the search for soup since it was Mothers Day n all. He ended up at Manuels dont ask me why!! Our white neighbor loves eating here, he had heard from somewhere or someone that they had the best albondiga (meatball) soup?! Well it was wayyy tooo salty other than that it was ok kinda spicey not too hot though. I dont eat meat but the kid liked the meatballs it looked like they had rice in them anh herbs too whod a thunk. Chips were a tad too greasy and the salsa wasnt too bad good heat, beans were good rice was alright. If it is necessary and in a pinch again Id go again but prob not."
5,Thomas was very welcoming and a great server/bartender. Came in close to close and still gave us ample time to enjoy our late night date. My lady and is date night are few and far between so to be able to have a experience like tonight is very appreciated. Kudos Thomas and citizen!
4,"In town for our 5 year wedding anniversary.  Sushi is one of our favs, so, after doing some reading on Yelp, off we went to Sakana. I must agree with many other Yelpers...the nigiri is fantastic!  Huge, tasty pieces of super fresh fish.  Im craving it now as Im writing this!  Im so glad I read the reviews and ordered several items from the nigiri menu...it was fantastic.   The rolls, while well priced, were a little disappointing.  Maybe it was just our selections, but nothing really jumped out at us...everything was pretty bland.  We asked our server for recommendations and everything was a California roll plus this or that.  Pretty blah.  Even the Mexican Caliente Roll was rather uneventful. The service was awesome.  Everyone was friendly, efficient, well organized.  The atmosphere was rather mainstream, which was fine with me.  I did have to laugh, as the first song we heard when we sat down was a Pitbull song, which another reviewer bemoaned.  The volume wasnt offensive, so it really only served to make me laugh.  The customer appreciation menu and Kirin beer special is genius.  So many customer appreciation menus are pretty sparse, but theirs is well fleshed out and offers a lot of options.  We each ordered Kirins while we waited for our table (we were told it would be 15-20 minutes, but it was maybe 5 minutes) and got 2 appetizers for 50 cents each.  Pretty cool.  (The scallop poppers were yummy.  The edemame was, well, edamame.  Not a huge serving, but what do you want for .50?) All in all, a good dinner.  We know when we go for sushi that its probably going to be a pricy night.  Not at Sakana...it was probably the best meal we had in Scottsdale at the very best price.  If were back in town, we will definitely return.  Ill just get more creative in my roll selection...or maybe just stick with the nigiri :)  Yum!"
5,"Went here for the first time last week and had a great experience. The restaurant was very clean, the service was great. The best part? The food. Ive been in AZ for 10 years now and I can say without a doubt that its some of the best food Ive had in a restaurant (and this from a pregnant woman no less ;) I had the fried chicken tenders, cheesy grits and fried okra. First, the food came out piping hot, I mean steaming and hot to the touch. The batter on the chicken was thick and crispy. The grits were cooked to perfection- dry enough to hold together a bit but still moist. And the okra was fantastic, too. It didnt hurt that my fresh lemonade came in a mason jar, either.  I will be back. a lot :)"
5,"Some of the best pizza Ive had in Phoenix. I prefer to get takeout since the inside is a little...eh... but who cares if the foods good! I love the crust, crispy and slightly chewy. The pizza can be a little greasy sometimes (but hey, its pizza), but as long as it doesnt soak through and make the crust all flimsy (which has never happened with the pizzas I get here!) its nothing that a paper towel or two cant fix! Im not a big wing person but my dad has had them and he says theyre pretty good. The staff has always been super-friendly, and they actually remember me, even though I only come in once every couple months!"
5,Just had takeout from here. Amazing as always!!! Had the carne asada torta. DDelish!!!!
4,"I am with some of the others in not understanding these poor reviews. I am from Rhode Island and Italian food is at our fingertips, and in Arizona, there are few and far between authentic non chain Italian restaurants. I feel that although ambiance is important, I didnt see anything wrong with Lo Cascios. There were no cheesy paper protectors over a linen table cloth, and there were no paper place mats with several business names, so not sure what the issue was there. And as far as the music....I would be annoyed too if I had to work there every night, but again, it only added to the atmosphere. In my opinion, some of the best Italian food does not come with yuppie atmosphere.   For the appetizer we had the fried mozzarella which my husband and I enjoyed very much. The marinara poured over it was on the chunkier side and I loved it because it tasted just like a sauce an old Italian friend of mine made. It was perfect. I had eggplant parmesan for my entree, and it tasted just like NYC Italian. The eggplant didnt have the shit fried out of it, and it had the finest light coating just the way I love my favorite dish. And my husband had veal milanese which was out of this world. It was in a sauce of lemon and wine, mushrooms and artichokes.   I also want to mention, we had the most Attentive waitress that I have ever had. Her name is Katie, and she was very sweet always asking us after each course if we needed anything and how everything tasted.   We will definitely be back here, we live down the road now in our new home and I am very happy there is a great little Italian restaurant nearby. I am also happy I didnt let the negative reviews scare me."
4,"Indulge Burgers got a few things right and a few things wrong, but overall, I was very pleased with my experience. We had a Living Social deal, and got the sweet potato and regular fries combo, as well as a side salad to start. The fries were good, but nothing special. The salad made me want to cry. I know you dont go to a burger joint to get a salad, but couldnt you at least try to make it a decent salad? It was all white lettuce and a few sprigs of sliced carrots. My husband wanted me to give the place 3 stars for the lettuce alone. But, the burgers themselves were good, and the Build-Your-Own was a really good deal. There is good variety on the toppings, cheese, sauces and buns to choose from. My turkey patty was huge - it was overflowing out of the English muffin.  Some plusses: the service was really, really excellent. One of the best servers Ive ever had. Also, while we were waiting for our table, the owner/manager came around and offered everyone samples of margarita. Since Im pregnant and couldnt try the sample, he said I got a free milkshake. After we were seated and he was walking around, he made sure our server knew that he had offered a free milkshake and made good on the promise! That was so cool. I left totally stuffed and very satisfied."
5,"Leah, the trainer, at Dog House Training Academy is great. Shes friendly, knowledgable, and makes herself available via e-mail or phone should you have any questions. Her knowledge on dogs is extensive, and even though youre just paying for the class, shell gladly offer up advice on any issues you may be having with your dog. The classes seemed simple enough to me, but there was a client in my class that just wasnt picking it up at all and blatantly disregarding her techniques. I was impressed with how Leah handled the situation and the customer. Shes very thorough, and always explains why she does things the way she does, and why it works. So there are no questions, and its always made perfect sense to me. With the quality of service, and the knowledge that you get to tap into while youre training with Leah, you just cant find a better deal out there. Her rates are competitive, and she offers referral discounts too."
5,"Went here for lunch after riding dirt bikes in the desert. We have had Mellow Mushroom in Georgia and Florida, but this one was top notch.  Very clean, staff very friendly , and food OMG to die for.  The garlic cheese bread is fantastic, and the calzones are my favorite."
4,"I was looking for a reco for a significant [eh hem] birthday dinner and foodie friend Jim suggested Mission because of Matt Carter.  We had a 7 res and parked right in front...fire blazing out front, nice feeling. Inside, the decor is appealling but because of the lack of soft surfaces, its really loud. [Full disclosure: I did not inform them it was my birthday] We were seated along the banquette wall and were a two top next to a four on each side. Noisy, obnoxious.  Server was very nice although stumbled over the bar order [and it turned out they made a scotch substition that they made no mention of]. Had I not already done my yelp research I would have been at a loss as to what to order. We skipped the apps and had the swordfish and the pork. Swordfish was a fine attempt but I thought over citrified and small bit over cooked. The pork tacos were genius. The combination of the pork, the sauce and the accompanying red onion, queso and cilantro on the home made corn tortilla just sang. The pork arrived as a glistening chunk that falls apart. Well worth the $32 and meant for two. You can also ask for more of the tortillas.  We shared the churros and milkshake for dessert. DEEEVINE. Warm chocolate churros sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and an amazing milk shake that we really enjoyed.  Id go back and sit outside by the fire and eat the apps and have drinks Plates are small to begin with and I think if you expect a crazy WOW dining experience, youll be disappointed. I think the service is working out some kinks, the bar seemed okay [although the TV is this space seems well, off putting...] and the kitchen seemed to be cranking.  I do think its very fine food.  ."
4,This salon is really cute. Fridays are 1/2 off single sessions and this is why I keep coming back. I use the level 2 bed and on Fridays its only $5 to tan. I wouldnt come here if they didnt have that though because membership prices are ridiculous and the customer service isnt that great.
5,"This place is excellent.  Hands down, the best tacos Ive had.  Fresh and flavorful meats and great salsas.  I see people raving about some of the ""salsa bars"" at all of the bertos and such but the salsa there is like water compared to what Tacos Atoyac has to offer.  They care about what they are serving and take pride in their craft. If you like the style of food here you must try Sonora Mesquite Grill on 46th Street and Thomas."
3,"i love mac n cheese & i love the dark.   these 2 facts make me like this place.   the service was good. the prices were reasonable. they had a decent selection of craft beer & local wine. the dark colors and candles were comforting.  (however this atmosphere makes the headlights from the cars parking up against the windows somewhat more obtrusive) a solid 3 stars for me.. i wasnt blown away, but i wasnt disappointed. . . . p.s. i think maybe ill miss lisa gs..?!"
2,"We got an online coupon to try this place and went on a Sunday around 7pm for dinner. The decor is very cool-neat floral booths with plastic overlay, beer taps at the booths, amazing mural on the far right wall.  We both enjoyed our margaritas, which for the size were fair on the $8 price tag.  The food was tasty, but not original. We ordered the ceviche app (which we liked the best), the mushroom tacos and the house salad with shrimp. Although our waitress came back and informed us that they were out of shrimp so we opted to try it without as there arent too many non-meat or fish options on the menu. The smashed plantains and pumpkin seeds were a nice touch in the salad, but it was lacking something special.  I can see coming here for happy hour or for a fri/sat night drink. They had a DJ booth which was cool, but (and I may sound old for saying this) it was just too loud for a Sunday night dinner."
4,"Great place for all your favorite kinds of Asian food.  Wonderful service...its a big place and they were busy, but since someone in our group was in a hurry to get to a flight they still managed to hurry things along.  Overall good food and huge portions.  The Happy Hour specials are great, too, so be sure to come during that time."
2,"Ok so I get the peanut thing, wood accented atmosphere, good service (although rather ""in your face"" at times) and the packed dining room / bar even on a Thursday night.  What I dont get is the awful food. This was my FIRST (and last) visit into this franchise restaurant. How they convinced franchisees and the general public to invest and vote with hard earned dollars is beyond me. I took my friends 11 year old there after he played in a bball game and after looking at the menu and pricing decided to split the rib eye special $19.99.  I got the fried pickle appetizer as well and was sorely disappointed in the batter and both of the ""dipping sauces"" (watery ranch and thousand island? I really couldnt tell).  Even a franchise like H***ers makes them WAY better......wow. On to the main course. The baked potato with butter and cream cheese was overcooked or something? I have never had a potato that seemed to have been soaked in some type of brine and then baked? Kind of par boiled or something. Anyway the color was greyish and the taste like that of a fishy sea salt. Moving to the broccoli i was greeted by a palor yellow looking presentation. I couldnt tell if it was cheesy cauliflower or ? Wow the taste was again that of something really overcooked or under matured...YICK The last chance at redemption came with the medium well rib eye. Good sized portion and easily split between the two of us 20oz. Good wholesome beefy taste and great texture only to be squallored  by a heavy Saltiness....not sure where this was picked up from but maybe by hanging out too close to the potato?  I really am normally an amicable restaurant patron but after forking over $46 including tip for two to split some food and getting served what we did ...well you get my drift. Signed,  NeverToStepFoot-InsideTheRoadhouseAgain"
5,"Bike cabs beware! Youve got nothing on this rig!  Tour de Tavern is a tribute to tipsy teamwork and a perfect way to host a unique group event. As ""pedalers"" on their inaugural tour, we enjoyed the celebrity treatment of cruising down the winding streets of Old Town Scottsdale as onlookers snapped photos and cheered us on! We rocked out to top 40 hits and, by special request, our Lonely Island favorites on their awesome sound system. Our guides were flexible and let our party run the show. If we needed more time for lets say...... an impromptu horseback ride in front of Shotgun Bettys, they were more than happy to wait.  As an added bonus everyone gets to burn off some of those unwanted cocktail calories in between your favorite watering holes. If you are concerned that after a few stops (and a few shots) your legs might lose some of that forward momentum, there are a few coveted ""non pedaling"" seats in the back of the bike. We all compromised with a friendly and fair rotation system.  Our tour guides were helpful, accommodating, and entertaining. They even proved to be exceedingly patient upon discovering that we did in facts have ""that guy"" in our group.  If youre saying to yourself,  ""Such a marvelous experience could only cost an arm and least the majority of a leg"" then you would be wrong! With the cost of gas being substituted for sheer earth friendly man power, our group of fifteen people spent less than $30 bucks each for the experience. But wait, theres more! Included in this price are all the amazing special deals that Tour de Tavern exclusively brings you at select bars along the route. On our tour we were offered drinks specials ranging from $3 to ONE PENNY!  I say this in all caps because its ONE PENNY! So next time you are planning an event, I recommend Tour de Tavern 100%! ""Look Ma! No hands!"""
1,"I ate at Scramble last Friday and I have to say that it was a horrible experience.  What attracted me to this place was the separate vegan menu in addition to their regular menu - this makes things easier when dining with vegan and non-vegan friends.  So I happily ordered a tofu wrap and added fried potatoes as a side and awaited my food.  We started eating and my friend found a hair in his food...not good!  He threw it on the floor and tried to drop it.  Well moments later I found a hair in my food...  I couldnt believe there was hair on both of our plates!  I was so disgusted I could no longer eat my food (and I was ravenous).  I told the girl working the register about the whole ordeal, she walked back to the kitchen then back to the register and completely ignored me (she said shed come back to my table).  Before we left I spoke with someone else and showed them the hair, clearly not one of mine.  All I got was ""Oh, Ill check the guys in the back.""  Check the guys in the back???  What?  How about, sorry may I refund you your money?  Additionally, the few bites I had of my burrito were pretty bland, it needed seasoning or hot sauce.  Overall, I wouldnt go back...unless I somehow develop a taste for hair, although Im sure that wont happen.  I did take a picture of my food before I attempted eating it and if you zoom in enough you can see part of the hair sticking out of my food - Ill be posting them."
2,"VERY BAD SERVICE + BELOW AVERAGE SUSHI = 2 STARS. The 2 stars is because the quality of food is below average and not that great. The Salmon looks like its been on the plates forever and has a real slimy look. Ive had way better sushi in some all you can eat places!! Basically the only good thing is the gimmick with the conveyor belt. I would advise the reader to save his/her money for a better sushi place like Kabuki. The next bad thing about this place is the atrocious service. They never bring you the drinks or seat you in a timely manner. God knows what the waitresses do over there...they run around as if its their first day at work and never get anything done like clear tables, get checks etc. Ive been here a couple of times and I saw that the 2nd time, the patrons were not even waiting for the waitresses...they formed a line at the cashier like Dennys."
4,This place is great.  I met up with a friend there for drinks after work.  I love the bar which has a garage type door that opens up so you can sit outside or inside.  Great intimate vibe outside under a big tree with lights.  Great warm vibe inside.  Great mix of basics and mexi-cali items like ceviche and tacos and burgers and mac and cheese.
5,"The Phoenix Art Museum was a day well spent. The atmosphere was inviting and it was like around every corner was a surprise waiting to be discovered. Admission was free for me. How you may ask? Our local library has cultural passes for various museums, try checking out your library next time you go. The museum was inexpensive adventure that took me across the world.   All the different exhibits kept me intrigued and interested. There were paintings, drawings, photography, and sculptures galore. There were even some animated pieces. I even stumbled upon a piece you could actually walk through. The layout of the museum is very easy to follow, as they give you a map and everything is labeled. You can go from the Asian culture, to English within a matter of feet. It is mind blowing. The whole world seems so much smaller, and its brought together so beautifully.   They offer guided tours, or you can walk around by yourself. There is also a childrens section to the museum. I have nothing bad to say about the museum itself. I am extremely happy that I went, and would recommend that anyone go. It would be a great date, or family day, or even a day by yourself. The Phoenix Art Museum is a place that I think everyone should visit while in Phoenix. It will really open up your eyes and make you think."
2,"I went here on a pub crawl after being turned away from an overcrowed Majerles during one of the Cardinals game. I was surprised to find the place nearly empty when just down the road Majerles had people falling out the door, but after ordering a few round of drinks I soon found out why the place was empty. The bar tender and manager were annoyed by the size of our group. When most empty bars would probably embrace 25 people walking in the door wanting to order drinks, the Stoudemires staff seemed overwhelmed and annoyed.  The restaurant is nice and clean, and the drinks were good yet overpriced.  I would defnitely not reccomend it for large groups.  For people looking for a good sports bar downtown head to Majerles because the patrons there seemed to be enjoying themselves and the staff seemed to enjoy having business."
4,"Ive never actually eaten in the restaurant - Swaddee is one of those places I used to pick up and take home when I lived in Chandler. So, first their take-out process: theyve never botched an order, food has been ready within the time frame given each and every time, and Im almost always in and out in a flash. The food: Ive sampled various veggie and seafood options, and theyve all been equally delicious. Since Ive never been inside for more than a few minutes, I cant really vouch for the atmosphere or the service, but I stand by the food. A little pricier, perhaps, than the Thai Basil down the street, but totally worth it."
2,"Liked the theme, didnt care for the execution.  Portions were scant, prices not commensurate with value.  All three diners were disappointed.  Left still hungry."
5,Wow these folks know customer service!  We like the fact there are always managers on the floor keeping things moving and tables clean.  Food is good and at a good price point.  A nice friendly well run place!
4,"in town for a conference and craving real food/a substantial breakfast to start the day - breakfast club, walking distance to our hotel, completely delivered.  our server was super friendly, though we were sleepy and indecisive; she recommended the french toast side we ordered to be made ala bananas foster - YUM.  more like dessert but nothing wrong with dessert for breakfast...  otherwise we had fairly standard egg dishes but they were yummy, fresh, served quickly, and exactly what we needed. the *only* complaint i have is wayfinding - perhaps, since they were setting up for an event downstairs, it was moved - but there were ZERO signs on ground level, and while we could smell bacon/coffee/breakfast, we had to lap the block a few times and only found it because we figured we may as well try the escalator...  a few signs would go far."
5,"We were in town for the weekend and I had a cigar at this lounge.  The cigar prices are reasonable and I didnt mind paying $9 for a La Gloria Wavelle.  Service was good and the atmosphere was nice and chill.  My Wife doesnt smoke cigars and the air circulation was good, no lingering smoke.  We met some nice people and the lounge singers were a plus.  We will come back next time we visit, I wish we had something like this in LA."
5,"will review after I eat. Ok so we ordered a Mongolian beef combo plate, sesame chicken (YUM) and pork fried rice , and sweet and sour pork. This was really really  good food. Good prices. When we are in the area we will definitely go back."
4,"Maui Dogs is great if youre looking for a dog thats a little out of the ordinary. Get the Hawaiian toppings, and both the polish sausage and bratwurst are good, I dont think Ive had a regular beef dog. This is one of the two places with good dogs I frequent that are like a block away from me. I go here if I want something unique, they go for a mix of sweet and spice here, and it works. I recommend the sweet and spicy dog, the sunset dog, and the spam sliders Maui style. Whatever I get I usually make it a meal with tots and either red cream soda or green tea. On my visit today they were giving away free samples of chicken wings with every meal. I liked the crispness of the skin, and once again the sauce was a nice mix of sweet and spicy. If (when) I order them in the future Im going to ask for extra sauce though. The only thing Ive had here that I wouldnt get again is a burger with chili on it. The thin chili is fine on a dog youre going to eat with a fork, not as much in a burger. Thankfully the cook was nice enough to suggest that I should get the chili on the side if I was ordering to go, so I still got home with decent food and not a soggy mess."
2,"Ugh. I used to like this place. But Ive gotten over it. I find the food to be uninspired, and below average. Blah."
4,"I love love love Angel Sweet, I just wish it was not in Chandler! Its a little bit pricier than most gelato shops I have been to in Phoenix, but not a big deal. They have a nice variety of choices, but my favorite by far is brownie batter, but they only have it every once in a while."
4,"Im on a low carb diet right now, so I had to pass on the pizza, unfortunately.  I was expecting to order a house salad with chicken.  When I told the server my diet limitations, she suggested a side of meatballs for about $4.  It was perfect.  I had the smallest bill at the table, and the meatballs were homemade and plenty tasty."
3,"Beautiful church. My husband and I were registered members and regularly attended mass here. Fr. John Auther gives excellent homilies. The Marian gift shop has beautiful religious gifts.  We got married at this church, but unfortunately had a bad experience. Communication with church staff was poor and we got little support during the stressful planning time.  We have since moved to Gilbert, so now we are attending St. Annes."
1,"Maybe I ate at a different restaurant than the other people, or once they got through the ""soft opening""  they gave up, because this place was not good. The service was mediocre at best, they seemed scattered and unfocused, took five minutes to get water.  I gave up on ordering anything else after that. The food?  Bland hamburger, that was cooked perfectly in the center.  Too bad that outside of the center inch it was completely overcooked and dry.  Soggy duck fat fried and average sweet potato fritters.   Lets talk about this ""coal oven"".  While the burgers are cooked in a coal oven, you could tell by the smoke hanging over the restaurant, they are cooked in an iron skillet i.e. pan fried!  The coal adds absolutely zero to the burger. Overall, if I am going to spend $10 on a burger with no sides, it better be perfect, and this wasnt.  I would also hope $5 would get me more than two fritters."
5,"My husband and I have been here twice in the last week for dinner...it is a bit pricey as other reviewers have said (around $20 for dinner entrees), but for vegetarian and organic food, what exactly do folks expect?  You get what you pay for.  We were happily surprised after reading the reviews...the food was amazing, the portions are huge and we had leftovers both times.  (and p.s., we paid with a debit card both times and have had no trouble, despite the review about only paying cash.) Our first visit, we were greeted kindly and given a plate of fruit to munch on until we ordered.  My husband ordered the mint tea and it was delish!  For an appetizer, we had the sabzi...which is a huge plate of green herbs, homemade wheat nan, feta cheese, and walnuts.  The herbs were FRESH and the nan was delicious...just the smell of it was enough to get us drooling! For entrees, we had the spinach herb stew and the vegetable stew with eggplant.  I am currently pregnant and garlic is not something thats agreeing with me.  I asked if the vegetable stew had garlic in it and the waiter said ""we can make it however you want...every dish is made when you order it""....what??  the dishes are made to order??  I havent heard that at a lot of restaurants!  After about 20 minutes, our stews arrived...steaming hot and smelling delicious.  They were HEAVENLY!  So many flavors and so fresh!! Our second time here, we had the dolmeh plate and Mast Va Mosear (a spinach dip)...both were ok...but I like the Sabzi better.  The entrees we had were amazing...I had a special of the day (pomegranate walnut sauce over tofu, which was blissful to smell and eat) and hubby had the vegetarian sampler to get his falafel fix. Overall, if you are willing to pay a little more for a nice, organic foods dinner, go here and check it out.  Everything will be fresh...everything will smell and taste delicious...and the restaurants atmosphere is perfect for a relaxed, decadent evening."
4,"Stopped there for breakfast. A cozy little place, with very friendly and smiling persons. Their house coffee is fine, but will have to go back for a dirty chai. I had also a bagel (just like any other). A nice drive through, and a good alternative to start the day!"
4,"I was in town early for a sales meeting at the Crowne Plaza Resort, just up the street. I walked over to Latitude Eight for dinner.  It was a pleasant surprise! Its a quaint little place, quiet, clean, probably a great place for a date or a quiet conversation. The owner and his wife run the place, it seems, with some competent and friendly help. The decor is modern, subdued, and futuristic. Its comfortable. I sampled an excellent microbrew while savoring a salad with a nice asian dressing, bean sprouts, lettuce, carrot, cucumber, and some other goodies.  Then came the Panang Curry Chicken with white rice. Whoa! Just the right amount of complex flavor and heat. It was so good, I ate every bite, and had no room left for dessert! This was among the top two or three best Thai meals Ive eaten over the years, and Ive probably had 50 or so. I wish I had been able to go back again during this trip. I suggested it to several people at our meeting, and heard several other good comments from people who wandered over to it."
5,I am obsessed with this place!  I cannot say enough amazing things...I love their exhibits...I love Arcadia Farms inside...I love the architecture and design of the building...I love the staff (they are so helpful)...the gift shop is fabulous (I got the cutest watch bangle)...I love the giant red t-rex out front...I love the kids area (or at least my son does)...I love the diversity of the art!  I would recommend getting a membership because it allows you to be able go all year long with your loved ones and family!  You can have weddings here and they are beautiful!  They have events here all the time if you sign up for emails or become a member...at least just go once and you will fall in love!
4,"Looove this place!  I loved the sexy, yet simple atmosphere.  I felt as though the air was cleaner somehow just walking inside. Let me first say that Happy Hour prices were outstanding!  I have to admit, I think my favorite Happy Hour spot, StingRay, has just been outdone! The food was delicious!  All of it!  ALL...OF...IT!  From the cucumber salad to their famous appetizer, the mustard leaf wrap, it is flavorful and fresh. The service was pretty good, but there was some confusion I think more than once, so it delayed the service a bit.  When I have to stop and say, ""Hey, wheres my [fill in the blank], I know the service is lacking, although I would say not enough to keep me away! I was really, really happy when I left here, might have been my company, but we all loved it so that is what mattered!"
4,"A couple of us came here Friday and had a good time. I liked the off-the beaten path location and the fact that there was no cover. They have 2-4-1 drinks 8-10pm, too. I thought the music was good and drinks werent too expensive. The thing that almost ruined my time was constantly being bumped by people. It is hard to get into the groove when you are being shoved and pushed by people who think they have an entire dance floor to themselves. But isnt that every place, though?"
4,"Obs, a great location in the quaint Gold Spot next to the soon-to-be Pita Jungle. I really like what they did with the space. The vintage elementary school chairs bring me back to the days of learning cursive and pasting cotton balls on paper to create a snowman. Lots of natural light, too! The coffee is spot on, and they have pastries as well. -1 star for not having a punch card. They need to get on that!"
5,"Whenever I get my car cleaned, this is the place that Ill always go to.  Theyre nice, efficient, and they do a great job.  My car is still shining a week later! The wait is very minimal.  The staff works together fantastically, and you can watch them clean your car so you dont have to worry about anything getting stolen.  Yeah its a little small, and a bit shabby, but like the first reviewer said, you dont go there for the waiting experience! Definitely worth the money!"
2,"Nothing spectacular about the food...service was good and the fruity adult beverages/margaritas were tasty. Somehow, between 2 people, we ended up spending close to $50. We thought the waitress was being friendly, but after ordering drinks, it seemed like all she wanted to do was sell us more random crap to get a bigger tip.  It was a nice change to see hockey on the big screen..."
5,"Great, fun atomosphere! Service was great! My wife and I had a wonderful date night here.  The fillet was nicely cooked and the sides were just as good.  Average prices but great value! Highly recommend this place for date night!"
3,"Went back to Liberty Market the other day and bought the Molinari pizza. A friend had complained that the outer edge always burned while the middle stayed too soft and undercooked. I like the stuff that comes on these pies, so I figured I would give it a shot. She was right. It wasnt unedible, but the middle part was pretty scary. I have no idea how they should fix this problem but this pie wasnt great even though I still love this place. Oh yeah, Joe, you also need Sweet & Lo!"
4,"Another indoor (two-story) Westcor Mall that has gone through a few minor changes over the years (updating the restrooms in the Food Court area, adding Dicks as another anchor store, adding the kids play area, etc...). Its also seen many big and small Retailers come and go too. When this mall opened back in 1994, Robinsons-May was the ONLY store open before the rest of the mall. There were empty fields in the surrounding areas and orange grooves in other parts. Its hard to believe, but the ONLY restaurant open at the time in the area was Applebees across the street. Fast forward to today, the Mall still attracts shoppers from all over, since its the ONLY indoor mall in the West Valley (not counting Desert Sky Mall-dont go there!). Anchor stores: Macys, Forever 21 (in the former Mervyns building), Dicks Sporting Goods, JC Pennys, Sears (formally Montgomery Wards), and Dillards. AMC Movie Theater is located inside the mall. Besides the Food Court, there is a Chevys, Johnny Rockets, and Miracle Mile Deli. Some newer Retailers include: Sephora, Coach, Disney Store (they came back!), Apple, Swaroski, and J. Jill. The mall stays pretty full of Retailers, once in awhile, there are a couple of empty stores, but not for very long. This is still a popular family friendly mall to visit and shop. Westcor keeps it updated and clean."
2,"I booked a night at this resort hotel because my daughter had a volleyball tournament in the area, and they had a special for 50% off suites. I wasnt impressed for a number of reasons.  First, even after the discount the rate was $124.00 which included an $8.00 (normally $30.00) ""resort fee"" which included things that any other cheaper hotel/motel would offer for free like local calls. Second, for the price I would expect modern things, like maybe a FLAT SCREEN T.V.! Come on, theyve been around for what, 10 years now? And a high dollar place like this cant afford one? Another annoyance was the fact that their high speed internet access costs $15.99 a day. I can get free high speed internet at any motel/hotel for less that $50.00 a night. Other annoyances include a t.v. remote that didnt work, and a shower head that was so loose that it almost came off when I tried to adjust it. I would never, ever pay $200.00 a night for this place, and regret even paying what I did."
4,"From reading previous reviews, times have changed.  The jockstrap has evolved since previous reviews.  This sports authority is #1 source of sporting goods.  Check out the Under Armour athletic apparel in the mens section, as they have mens trunk underwear that will keep the jingle in your jangle and is as described.  Ive purchased a couple and its evolutionary.  Like any retail store, when it comes to pricing you have to be proactive.  To get a break, I check out the Wednesday flier thats in with the junk mail or sunday inserts.  Usually you can find some good incentives.  Also if you take a couple of minutes to do their invitation online survey you get $10 off of $50.  Thats 20% and if you are willing to succumb your online privacy and give them your email, they will notify you of employee friends and family promotions at 25% off.  I used it to purchase a $399 Diamondback that I ended up getting for $200 after a sale.  Staff are friendly if you ask and if they dont have a size will do a check to see if another location carries what you are looking for.  Im wondering where their Puma selection is as I would consider that to be just as popular as addidas.  Due to the location its my first sports stop, and even though I remember Albertsons, the last thing Ill be thinking about when Im there is cottage cheese."
4,"Phoenix has some absolutely amazing Italian pizza joints. And when Im in the mood to spend some extra money and wait a while I go to them. But man alive! Red Devil is pretty close in terms of quality and its a lot more laid back. During our last visit, we sat in back. The space has several nice little tucked away areas so everywhere has a nice private feel. Our waitress was really nice and accomodating and was with us in just over a minute. Some of the fancier drinks were recommended, but we were content with just plain old lemonade. Just the right balance of sweet and tangy. The bruschetta arrived quickly fresh out of the oven. The oil and tomatoes were spilling over the top and had a very rich flavor. The Italian pizza was just right temperature wise and the green olives added a nice salty kick to the sausage. The prices are reasonable. The staff is great and the pizza is delicious.  Plus we met a 6 year old in the parking lot who claimed to be a princess. How great is that?"
3,"This is great if you are in a hurry, they have slices and salads ready to go. Above average quality and a nice open space too. Perfect stop before or after catching a movie next door."
4,I remember this place being good the few times I went there. I had a chicken salad sandwich one time that was awesome. I miss it.
5,"Lees is the best privately owned ice cream parlor in Scottsdale! Located in Old Town Scottsdale in the heart of some prime dining locations, Lees is a great night cap in the form of ice cream, a superb place to bring a date or all in all just a wonderful atmosphere to enjoy some ice cream con alcohol.  Lets start with the aesthetics; Lees offers a very clean, small, cozy environment.  A few table and chair sets dot the inside and a couple more to match on the outside. Lee has some awesome glass vases on the wall that add a modern touch. She has a few large clocks with different time zones so you know what time it is on the east coast while you eat? I dunno the clocks were kind of a head scratcher. The Service is spectacular! Lee is the only help Ive ever received there, so I am not sure if she works alone or has help. She is always timely and prompt to greet and serve you and automatically starts you off with TWO samples of which ever flavors you would like. All the young ones like myself be prepared to show ID, although you would have to eat a lot of ice cream to get loaded, Lee doesnt skimp on the booze either. Lee is usually a bit on the quiet side so you gotta listen up and be as patient with her as she is with you. The lady is running the joint by herself!  The Product is what makes Lees so good! Her ice cream flavors are inventive and wonderful. There is usually new options as well a few solid customer favorites too choose from. As pre-mentioned Lee does pack a fair amount of liquor in her ice cream so some of the flavors have a stronger alcohol flavor than others. The Jack Daniels chocolate swirl is my personal favorite and has the perfect amount of bourbon to chocolate ratio to make a unique, delectable treat. Lee does offer non-alcoholic flavors (at a discounted price, too!) for those opt to take there alcohol and ice cream separate. The cookie dough flavor may be the best ice cream I have tried with or without booze."
4,"I was put up here after not making a flight (the woman I talked to at the gate blamed Orbitz for not scheduling enough time to make a connection). True. But then a really nice man hooked me up with a voucher for this hotel accomodation! I didnt realize that ALL the Embassy suites do the Managers happy hour in the evenings; this one was 5:30 - 7:30...But let me back it up a bit. My whole experience here was wonderful. A nice man, Terry, drove the shuttle from the airport and was very helpful giving me some ""things to do ideas"" around the area - movie theatre, shopping mall...etc. When we pulled up to the front he even pointed out a restaurant next door, 7-11 and CVS. I was super tired from my flight so it was nice that he took the time to point things out since I was not paying attention. I went inside and checked in- very fast and smooth. The FD clerk even offered me a beverage- hot coffee/tea/cocoa.  She even told me how to access the internet free of charge.  I found my room quite quick and going inside was so refreshing! I had an immense amount of space for just me, as these acommodations are suites. The little kitchenette was stocked with tea and coffee and ice machine was just around the corner, not too far of a walk.  It was extremely chilly in the room so after I found the thermostat, I turned it to be warmer- I ended up turning it off I was so cold.  I did a quick flip through of TV channels but didnt find anything I wanted to watch. And then I tried to connect to internet- fast and easy.  I called to see about getting a bathrobe and some toothpaste and it was brought up in less than 10 minutes! I thought about going sightseeing and ended up taking a nap. I didnt realize how tired I was!  The bed was great! Comfy and warm!  I didnt want to get up!  But I ended up getting up so I could go to CVS across the street for a few needed items. Next morning when I left, there was nothing I needed to do to check out and the shuttle service back to the airport was very prompt.  I wouldnt mind staying here again should I be stopping through town or stuck overnight on an unforseen layover! #Yelp 365 Challenge - 124/365"
5,"Just had my first hot dog at Short Leash Dogs and quite honestly, I cant call it a ""hot dog"" because that just conjures up images of, well... a hot dog. And Short Leash Dogs are so much more and better than ""a hot dog"" the way most people know hot dogs. Know what I mean? No? Well, go have a Short Leash Dog.  Really unique combinations, various dog options (all local meats and produce) - bratwurst, beer hot, veggie...  My friend and I shared an Aiko (we chose the brat as our dog), with mango chutney, red onions, cilantro, mayo and jalapeño on a naan (you might have read that in other reviews, no traditional buns here!).  You can find the Short Leash Dogs truck at the Phoenix Public Market on Wednesday evenings and Saturday mornings, and if you follow them on Twitter (@shortleashdogs) you can find out when/where else they make regular stops... scottsdale, central phoenix... Track em down and eat their food. And talk to them - Brad and Kat are smart enthusiastic folks with a great sense of humor and offer superb food and service! Whats not to love?"
4,"Is it worth the trip for a Chirico and Egg sandwich from Chaka Chaka, heck yes!!!!"
5,"I love this place! We werent sure what to expect since the restaurant is in an office building plaza.  Kinda weird, but the employees in the other businesses are lucky! We went in here on a whim after reading all the awesome Yelp reviews.  Our first impression was a girl at the front and she was super nice and didnt rush us while we were checking out the menu options. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with macaroni & cheese and my husband ordered the brisket sandwich with a side of baked beans.  He also ordered a side of ribs to sample.  The wait wasnt too bad -- it took about 10 or 15 minutes and it was ready to go.  They are cool with their sauce and let you fill up the small plastic cups and take as much as you want of it (which is awesome, because the sauce tastes SO good!).   Its a nice, thick sauce and they have several flavors to choose from. We go to a nearby area to have a little picnic by ourselves and notice that they forgot to include the side of ribs.  We pack everything up and go back to get those.  The employees were really nice about it and apologized and gave my husband the side of ribs.  We repeat the same process and realize that they also messed up my husbands order and gave him a pulled pork sandwich instead of the brisket sandwich.  We decide to let it go and eat our food. The pulled pork has great flavor.  The meat actually tastes like it has been smoked for several hours and is good enough to eat on its own without any sauce.  However, we werent going that route, because the sauce is too damn good not to eat.  The baked beans and macaroni & cheese were not anything special, but they were good.  The ribs were our favorite part!  We absolutely loved them.  Very tender and the sauce they chose to slather them in was delicious. This place is pretty far from where we live, but we would definitely go out of our way (again) to eat here more."
2,Highest gas  prices in the valley!
5,"Fast, friendly, and clean.  You dont get to say that too often when describing a post office!  Serously though, these guys are great."
2,"Checked this place out today for lunch as a possible spot to watch NFL games. Took advantage of their lunch menu and got the sliders. I get my bill and $2.50 is added to my bill for a beverage.  I was drinking water. Apparently, you have to buy a drink to take advantage of the lunch specials. I was not informed of this and was pissed. On top of that the sliders were mediocre at best.  These specials that have these restrictions drive me crazy. A heads from the bartender about the beverage deal would have been nice. When I questioned the bill, the original bartender who took my drink order said, ""she didnt tell you?"" Im not going back to this place."
3,"10/12 Friendly and quick, although I had to point out a few spots where extra attention was needed (tar on one side was initially observed as paint scratch, until I told them to check it again).  I also found a few spots that couldve used another one or two swipes of the towel, and the sunglass case was never touched and thus dirty.   Be sure to visit during the early part of the week, and not on the weekend to grab the best deals- I paid $100 for both interior and exterior detailing.  Am so happy with the overall results- the spots between the bottom of my car seats and the floor are completely clean of caked-on food debris (I am living in the middle of the desert, after all) from a few mishaps throughout the years!"
4,I was really pleased with Bombay Spice..its definitely not your typical Indian restaurant setting.. Think more contemporary American decor... I mean The Smiths were playing on the stereo which gave it a nice relaxing casual vibe. We were served by a great friendly waitress who really knew the food and explained everything real well.. You can tell she was very excited about it. We started with the appetizer sampler which had four selections of appetizers of your choosing..all were outstanding especially the wings and the chickpea ceviche.  I then tried the Chicken Tikka Masala which had lots of great flavor and a nice kick then we checked in on Yelp and got a free dessert. Great prices and the way you order the food makes it really simple.. Great little casual place tucked away in the corner of a strip mall near PV mall.
5,Pet smart did a better job at grooming my dog than my last mobile groomers. They cut and wash my dogs hair just how i like them. Service was nice the young ladies were always helpful since two dogs on a leash can be difficult. I shall return to get my dogs groomed here.  Would recommend.
3,"While the idea is not new - an updated outdoor shopping center that mimics a European outdoor shopping and residential district, Kierland Commons is similar to West Village in Dallas, TX or Santana Row in Santa Clara, CA, however, in the Scottsdale version, it is completely stripped of any personality and design, perhaps to better blend in with the desert environment. The usual suburban chain stores can be found at this shopping center, ranging from Smith and Hawken, Banana Republic, Barnes & Noble and the like, though there are a select few independent retailers which make a trip to this center a little more interesting.  Parking can be difficult, however, there are lots that line the backside of the center as well as valet parking across from the center park.  People watching is quite entertaining, from the kiddies that frolick in the fountains, to Barbies desert siblings. The independent dining options are a little more interesting, such as The Green House and Zinc Bistro, though again, the usual unimaginative chains are represented here, including PF Changs and The Cheesecake Factory.   While I dont find most of the retail offerings at Kierland Commons to be particularly compelling to make multiple repeat visits, I will return for the more independent dining options."
1,"If we hadnt arrived after a tiring day and prepaid online, I would have checked out.  Furniture missing.  Security bar sheared off.  Faceplates for wiring gone.  Furniture handles missing.  Bobby pins and scraps of things on carpet - hadnt been vacuumed.  Two remaining chairs badly stained.  You wouldnt want to sit on them.  No uniforms or name tags on staff.  Pick another chain.  The reviews for the other Ramadas in the area - which I read after the fact - reflect the same things."
5,"GREAT PLACE TO HANG OUT AND WATCH THE SCENERY With a little help you can drink & choose from about 25 beers, 8 scothes,10 whiskeys,8 Really good tequilas (just ask me) along with the every day vodkas & some pretty impresive wines (or whines). Dont miss this little gem in the rough & com listen to music or watch sports or just drink. Oh yea the owners are OK also"
2,"Ya know - I could see this place being very inconsistent and I was there on a ho hum day.   The wine recommended was their chianti which tasted pretty bad, they have a weird assortment of imported beers, and like a couple other reviews the pizza had little flavor.  We order a PESTO chicken pizza and we had to bite around on each piece to find the pesto, no flavor, a bit dry and the pizza was really late and warm - late and warm which means =  sat there for a while.  Our waitress was nice, cute, fun but hey that only gets you 2 stars.   The salad was better than the pizza and the wings were pretty good. - Thats all folks.!!"
5,"...the customer service alone gets 5 stars, but when you factor in the semi-annual sales it is more like 6.  Having been to a number of Nordstroms in multiple cities Id put this particular location on the same level as those in San Francisco (without the assinine traffic to contend with) and Seattle and only a notch below the best of the best in Chicago.   Living in a city with a Nordstrom and a Nordstrom Rack is going to be a daily exercise in resisting temptation."
4,"Cool stable up in Cave Creek where my wife and I took a sunset ride. Very casual environment with some folks who seem to like what theyre doing.  I got a horse named Sox who wanted to move forward all the time, but was easy to control. Our guide was very informative and casual at once, had fun with us and did a great job including everyone.  That pig is humongous! Easily the biggest pig Ive ever seen. I cant believe that guy can walk around. I want a pig like that."
4,"Its 4:00 am on a Friday, youve just finished listening to awesome music and drinking too much, youre starving and want some good comfort food to fill your gut and soak up that alcohol..... enter Jerrys. The place was open.  The place was clean.  The food was good.  The service was great.  The prices were great.  WAY better than a Dennys, better than most diners Ive been to, actually. I had ham and eggs and the plate was delicious.  The ham steak was gigantic, the eggs perfect, and hash browns were done just right... crispy and good."
5,"My dad and I decided to try Great Wall because he had heard many reviews about the place and everyone insisted that you had to come try the Dim Sum.  Since I was in town visiting, it gave us the perfect excuse to go. Im happy to report that the experience was most excellent at Great Wall and that it lived up to the hype.  Upon getting there, we were given a number to wait as the restaurant was completely full, there were probably 150+ people there dining, however, we were seated within 15 minutes.  As soon as we  sat down, the carts started rolling by with various plates of items to try. The pancake, shu mai, shrimp, duck, and sliced beef inside a wrapper are highly recommended, all were excellent.  I did have a bit of trouble taking the shrimp out of the steam container because their rice wrappers were sticking a bit, but that does happen. I would advise that if you have an allergy to shrimp that you make sure to ask the server what is in some of the items because they do come with shrimp, including their egg rolls.  Since my dad has a shrimp allergy we did have to watch for that.  I did want to try their egg rolls but I would have been the only one eating them, and they were big enough to make a meal in itself. The sliced duck was one of the best I have had at a restaurant, well cooked with crispy tasty skin, and not too many bones to get in the way, and very reasonably priced at $6.25 for a plate.  Most other Dim Sum plates are $2.25 or $3.15 so you can end up eating a lot for a very reasonable price. If you love Dim Sum and are willing to wait a few minutes for a table, but you will get fast service afterward, this really is the place you want to go to.  There are still so many more dishes to try as well, but that will be for another trip."
3,"They serve breakfast all day, which is always a plus.   I had the tomato soup with grilled cheese.  The bread was delcious, tasted homemade.  However, there was way too much cheese, and it wasnt fully melted.   My g/f had the eggs benedict, which looked really good.  She said it was really good, and filling.   3 stars.  Ive had better.  Ive had worse.  La de da."
5,"Many have started out with this and it should be stressed , this wonderful place is TINY!  Suggest you make a reservation so you get he chance to enjoy the wonderful food that is in store. We started with the stuffed mushrooms , like many others raved about, and the Portuguese style mussels. Both were fantastic and left us wanting to come back to try the other mussel offerings and appys as well. The endless bread was the perfect tool for soaking up the rich juices the mussels were bathed in.   Were were pretty full, but thought we would take a run at the Espana pizza. Hands down the best pizza we have ever had. The flavor could not be any better and the perfectly created thin crust let you enjoy the toppings as both a compliment and as a way to get it easily into your mouth!  Feels more like you have been invited to a friends house for an awesome meal as opposed to a restaurant. Great people and they went to all lengths to make ours and the other patrons meal fantastic (even the entirely needy, hard to please, and somewhat obnoxious woman seated near us) While I am sure they would make your super comfortable if you had to wait, suggest you  make a reservation so you can enjoy this great little place"
5,"I am a G-Spot addict!  Had to limit myself from going every week though.   Took the hubby there after a date night the other weekend.  It was his first time to try gelato.  Hes a ColdStone guy 100% and he really enjoyed the Tiramisu gelato!   The focaccia flatbread is awesome!!!  And I would post a photo of the Focaccia Flatbread I got earlier to eat along with my homemade salad, but (in the words of LOLCat) ""I eated it"" and forgot to take a photo first.   :) My favorite salad dressing is the champagne vinegarette!   The mintchip gelato is freaking awesome!   The stracciatella gelato mixed with mint - even better!!!   G-Spot is so awesome, that I just walked back over and got my Mint / Stracciatella combo.  Baby C wanted something sweet!   :D"
5,"Okay, I admit it - we are waaaaay late to this party. We tried once before but the hour-plus wait was just two much for the four starving carnivores with me that day. This time our strategy was to go early on a Saturday morning as close to 6:30am opening as possible. We arrived around 7:15 (it WAS the weekend after all) and only waited about 20min for a table for two.  I had the special of the day - 3-egg scramble with andouille sausage, fresh local baby spinach and fontina cheese - YUM! The sausage had just the right enough of bam and the home fries with rosemary and onions rocked. My companion had the hog and chick - awesome meaty bacon with that. Great value for the price - I packed up at least half my meal for the starving teenagers at home (who could not be roused at dawn). If you havent been, get up early, bring a newspaper and rest assured Matts Big is well worth the wait."
2,"Not good. Very bland Thai food, ugh, the two words do not belong together, bland and Thai! The Peanut sauce was the worst ever. The Pad Thai and Tom Ka Gai soup were blech. Fresh rolls large but no flavor. The service was decent though. Just disappointing."
5,"Awesome. So much better than parking on site. Safe and good prices keep me coming back. Flying during a busy time, go to their website to make a reservation...thats right a reservation! Also print out a coupon for a couple bux off per day."
3,"This is a quick grab some decent food kind of place.. this is not by any stretch THE place to go for Thai-  Its best for lunch specials... expensive-ish for dinner for what it is.  Its fine.  We go for lunch because they are AMAZINGLY fast (insert premade everything), but when we get tired of the same ol same ol we head to Thai Hut.   We have had some instances of meals being too hot/spicy for our table, so be sure you mean spicy when you order a spicy dish."
4,"Im so glad I have a nice coffee shop within walking distance of my office! Though the location is a plus, the real reason I have become a regular is that they open earlier than Lux - 6 am - and have free WiFi. During a two month string of early morning test prep, the openers remembered me and asked about my progress on a daily basis. My favorite part about Urban Bean is that ALL of their products are compostable and they run a compost in the back.  The only reason I didnt give five stars is because they have yet to add large tables (for two or three people to spread out books to study). Other than that - its my fave!"
2,The customer service here could be 100% better but then again not much around here is anywhere near the greatness of texas customer service!!  Was not greeted when walking in and waiting for about 25 minutes!
5,"BEAUTIFUL! Phoenix doesnt get much more amazing then when youre looking down at her from Dobbins Lookout. A few tips: 1. Get there before 6pm. The park closes the entry but if youre in, you can stay as long as you want.  2. Be ready for a drive up a mountain -- scary cliffs and tight corners. Make sure you go slow, watch for hikers and cyclists, and overall be cautious. 3. If youre heading to the summit for the views (Dobbins Lookout) bring a jacket or blanket. Its cold and windy when the sun goes down, even in the summer. There are bathrooms but no water fountains at the Lookout."
3,"E-Z Buffet is a Chinese buffet that recently opened in my neighborhood.   It was about $10 for dinner .  The place had a bunch of tables so seating was easy.   You can also get take out. They have a lot of food to choose from, typical Chinese fare plus sushi, fried chicken wings, roast beef, salad fixings, pudding & fruit.  They also had ice cream for desert, not soft serve but hard ice cream.   I like the General Tsos Chicken, Scallion Pork and their freshly steamed green beans.  I loved their rocky road ice cream.  The wait staff was prompt and friendly.  I really liked that. This place is worth trying.  If you go please write a review.  Id love to know what others think."
4,"we come here once every two months for date night.  the serivce is generally slow because these are students, but everyone is super nice and tries their best . luckily every issue weve had has been with confidence for the front of house stuff (speaking up, looking at you in the eyes) -- the food is always excellent  generally they dont always offer everything on the menu but its generallty the cod or sole.   the filet is always fantastic.  desserts are yummy. really everything is good.  the price cannot be beat $15 for a 5 course meal.  dont expect to get a last minute reservation,  its generally for a few weeks out.  we like this place and happily tell others about it every chance we get."
5,"From the outside you wouldnt guess the kind of school it is - its in a strip mall, its small, not very well known - but if you took the chance to come inside and see for yourself you would be very surprised and impressed.  This is by far the best dojo I have ever run across.  You are welcomed when you enter the door, all your questions are asked whether they seem stupid or not. You are treated kindly and with respect from the get go - a very warm place to walk into.  I was so impressed with this place I signed my kids up immediately.  They have so many types of classes and the variety and time schedule they really try and have it work around your family so you have your time as well.  The teachers here are amazing and always do their best to make it the best class you have every time.  I would recommend this dojo to anyone that asks me - and I do.  If you havent come into this place and tried it or have your kids try it then you should - you are missing out."
5,Yep -- still my favorite hole-in-the-wall eatery awesomeness. The brisket sandwich with cheddar and slaw and dippin sauce was to die for. I ate at the bar and just enjoyed my visit.  Cant wait til I can walk here!
3,"I love Harkins Theaters in general, but this one simply doesnt seem to be kept up as well as most. Its a little dingy, the bathrooms arent typically in great shape, the screens themselves are good sizes and the chairs really are comfy, but the concession stand dosent seem as clean as it should be and it typically has the movie theater sticky floor going on. Harkins AZ Mills really is A-OK, but there are enough other theater choices that I typically make this one my la"
4,"I really am a fan of this place. It has good food and good beer, and also is associated with some good memories here. This place is a great place to come to and watch a game or two. Or in our case, a great place to come to after watching out team win or lose the game. The parking here can be difficult since there is no lot or anything designated for costumer parking. The beer is really good here. I like the lighter beers, such as their regular peach beer, but their other beers and seasonal are awesome too. The food is delish; I always get a hankering for their beer battered fries. Eat it with their jalapeño ranch sauce and its perfect. That and some loaded chicken nachos are easily split between friends; their portion sizes are fairly huge. Its really an awesome spot to get together with friend, have a pint, enjoy a game and some good food."
4,"In my opinion, there is nothing better than a delicious salad chock-full of a combination of fruit, nut and cheese.  The Organic Spinach and Cranberry salad with chicken is pretty much the stuff dreams are made of (well, delicious salad dreams at least).  The salad is so flavorful that you hardly even need to use the dressing.  I could eat this salad every day, but, alas, its quite pricey at nearly $12.00"
2,"As a pretty devoted Frys shopper, I have to say this is one of my least favorite locations. Unfortunately, its the closest one to me, so I end up there often. Its almost always crowded, the layout is less than intuitive, and Ive gotten questionable produce on more than one occasion. The employees are friendly enough, but its just no comparison to other locations. By the looks of it outside, it seems like it would be pretty large, but once you get inside its cramped and the selections seem limited.  I suppose this is mostly things they cant change, but its enough to make me drive a few miles out of my way to avoid it if I have the time."
4,"Great place, great food, great staff. I just had a chicken salad but my husband had the Jambalaya, he said it was the best he had ever had.Had the bread pouding for dessert..fantastic! We wil certainly return."
1,"We came there on November 5, 2011 and the service was very bad. The worst I have ever seen and we were treated like shit. We came into town from LA and Vegas for the NFL game and seen Mrs. Whites cafe on Foodnet Work and knew the food had to be great. The chicken was great, but the customer service was so bad we will never return again.  We got a refill on our drinks and the guy poured sum of our drinks on the left overs so we could not take our food back to the hotel. Foodnet Work shame on you for recommending this place. Just because the chicken is good, does not mean you treat people like shit.  We had to remind the staff over six times to get our order. We waited over 40 minutes to get the other 3 pieces of chicken to finish our meal. We dont mind waiting but it was pretty rude when you are watching other peolple are getting their meals when they walked in after us. The Mac and Cheese did not look like everyone elses order- it look like it came out of a box. You can tell it was far from homemade, it cleary was not bake, no crust. The gravy was watered, missing favor. Corn bread was over cooked under salted. The cornbread sure as  hell did not look like everyones elses cornbread. I felt like we received the leftovers.  Truly the worst service we ever received. The place needs to learn how to be respectful and just be nice."
4,"This park is always a pleasant experience.  Honey and I like to drop by the dog park and then take a walk and make a big loop around the lake.  It isnt the greenest park in Phoenix by any stretch of the imagination, but it does offer a pretty nice view and lots of space to enjoy the outdoors."
1,"So sad to say, I have to change my rating from 5 stars to 1.  I had been a faithful customer of Katies for years, at least 3 or 4!  She told me she wasnt going to be doing nails anymore because she had developed carpal tunnel.  I was heartbroken.  But she told me she was training the others in her shop to be able to do nails like her so I figured I would continue to go there.  Next appt I needed, I called and scheduled and said it doesnt matter with who because Katie isnt doing nails anymore, right?  I was then told that Katie is still doing nails but she was full that day.  Very hurtful!  I always tipped her VERY well and was always willing to work with her schedule.  But needless to say, I dont go there anymore, havent been there since I ended up cancelling that appt and going elsewhere."
4,great place to go with out of towners after a downtown game! the drinks here are better than the bar food!
4,"First, just be careful of sitting on the planters on the north side of the building if you have to wait for a table... sometimes you might get surprised by ants...  Now, if that didnt scare you away (and I was trying a little, because I am hoping to tamp down the wait time a scoche) please enjoy yourself! Postinos Arcadia location is the original forerunner in the revitalization of the Phoenix scene. Postino. Cleverly located in a former Post Office. Thanks USPS.   If you find yourself here with a wait (not always, but sometimes) look about yourself. The patrons at this location are uber friendly. With a larger-than-average number of regulars, some of them have very good stories to share, and are particularly generous.  We waited one night and had two gentlemen with a high top table offer to let us share their space. It was a rousing good time full of mutual ease, and they left before our party of 3 had finished. When we went to pay, we found out they had taken care of the entire bill. Thanks guys! Its that kinda place. A little magical, a little homey, a little bit of wonderful with great food and plentiful draughts, and just enough contemporary edge that you can impress a date, or drink with the dudes."
4,"Tonight was my second time dining at Yasus. I was really excited to score a seat at the sushi bar, eagerly hoping to chat it up w/ the sushi chefs. However, they seemed too flustered w/ all the orders that they made a minimal attempt to talk to me besides asking, ""is everything ok?"" And I think the Mexican sushi chef is new so the Japanese sushi chef had to instruct him on certain things a few times.  I started off w/ an order of kampachi sushi, per one of the recommendations of the Japanese sushi chef. While it tasted fresh, it was very blah to me... nothing special about it at all.  A few minutes later, the waitress arrived to take my drink order. I decided to just stick w/ water and told her I was ready to order a few items off the paper menu. I had decided on mirugai (giant clam/geoduck) w/ mixed mushrooms, hamachi sashimi w/ jalapenos and ribeye sumibiyaki. First up was the hamachi sashimi w/ jalapeno slices. Nice thick slices of buttery hamachi, but all the seeds were scraped out of the jalapeno slices so they werent packing much heat. After I ate them all, I remembered that theres a freakin recall on jalapenos in AZ and there wasnt a sign in the restaurant stating that their jalapenos are safe. JUST. EFFIN. GREAT. I hope I dont get salmonella. If you dont hear from me in a few days, pls call for help.. I live alone! And tell them, IT WAS THE JALAPENOS FROM YASUS THAT DID ME IN! Anyhow, next up was the mirugai w/ mixed mushrooms dish. Very small portion, but it was tasty. They were a bit skimpy on the mirugai to mushroom ratio so that was a little disappointing. About 10 minutes later, the waitress asks if Im all done.. I ask her about the ribeye and she asked the sushi chef & kitchen in a frantic tone.. They reassured us it was almost ready. Another 10 mins later, it arrives.. I guess it was worth the wait.. it was soo tender I was able to ""cut"" off the fat w/ my chopsticks. DEEE-FREAKIN-LISH. It could have used a lil salt, but thats just me being picky. The 3 sweet dipping sauces helped. Next time, I wanna try the duck sumibiyaki.  Since I had a $50 gift card (that I purchased from the radio promos for $25), I had another $10 to use up so I ordered the shrimp skewers wrapped in crispy noodles. The crispy noodles were like deep fried chow mein noodles. Interesting, but good.  Stuffed like a pig, I paid and waddled out w/ my leftovers in tow."
4,"My girlfriend and I had dinner here with my brother and his wife this past Saturday. It was packed outside so we had to sit outside which was fine. If anything it got a little too warm under the heat lamps, but the atmosphere was fine. Food was very tasty across the board. We had steak and organic chicken on our side of the table both of which were cooked exactly how we wanted them. Juicy and tender.  Service was excellent. Recommended."
4,"We came to Half Moon Sports Grill to watch the UFC Fight. Its a nice big place, yet we had to get there early since it filled up quick.  The place is fun, the girls wear short skirts and knee socks. They have a full list of local beers in bottles and on draft. They boast a monthly special, which Julys is a burger for 1/2 price if you buy a drink. Thats almost $4.50 for a giant burger with fries. Unfortunately I was full from lunch and did some light snacking with my beer drinking.  First up, I wanted the Watermelon Wheat - Perfect for any hot Arizona day (which is most of them) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iB9By3dVS6BydSUiDHxLyw?select=0TZG-EndU48FUsm_K39bmQ#MrdXI7O_NSKVvqgGTcIYOA Then, the Dirty Guera Blonde Ale, because I love blonde ales and cute names. It was great and encouraged us to visit Nimbus the next day! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iB9By3dVS6BydSUiDHxLyw?select=0TZG-EndU48FUsm_K39bmQ#5nzmTTMOmGj_sVIxkTM51Q In between, we ordered a couple appetizers, a gigantic pretzel that was served with both queso and mustard. I love to dipp! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iB9By3dVS6BydSUiDHxLyw?select=0TZG-EndU48FUsm_K39bmQ#lMQuuVAuKQAL-RKfEYkPWg And my guy ordered the Prime Rib Sliders (4) served with carmalized onions, french dip sauce and horseradish. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iB9By3dVS6BydSUiDHxLyw?select=0TZG-EndU48FUsm_K39bmQ#seP7cR-l6f3xjnJtzFQIxA That was a meal in itself, really.  For Dessert, I ordered the White Chocolate Ale which was by far the most dessert tasting beers I have ever tried. It was so much like a sweet white chcolate, you really need to savor every sip. If you see this anywhere, order it and thank me later. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iB9By3dVS6BydSUiDHxLyw?select=0TZG-EndU48FUsm_K39bmQ#1jzaMBgdEa9YyVasa8rukQ After all that, I needed a couple sugar free Red Bulls to snap myself back in action. We had a fight to watch and I was not going to be the first to TAP OUT."
4,"I worked here when I was 20 and I couldnt fully appreciate what they have to offer. Its unfortunate I didnt take advantage of my 30% employee discount, but I was poor since I worked there.  I really enjoy this place now, the dining room tables are the best buy ever! I was shopping fore like 5 months for a table with bench seats instead of chairs.  Then I remembered how many Cost Plus had. I went in and they have 4 different kinds for 199.00 I dont know if you have been bench shopping lately but I find them ion the price range of 700-1200. I liked a lot of the tables but they didnt match my style so got a table somewhere else and bought the benches here.  They also have walkers shortbread cookies on sale all the time. Ok the ingredients on that: Butter, sugar, flour, salt Sooo Goood But yeah great buys on tables, but they have midget couches. They are for like a childrens playroom."
5,"This is a very special medical practice with customer service and attention to detail that you hardly ever see in a doctors office anymore. I started seeing Dr. Ross for Osteopathic Manipulation after having a few back surgeries. He has given me tremendous relief and I highly recommend OMT rather than chiropractic treatment since it works with the tissue and muscles as well as the bones. Anyways, He listens and takes time to treat your WHOLE body unlike most doctors that have one hand on the door knob as they speak to you.  I saw a Naturopath in the past and saw Cheryl the P.A. for the first time the other day. She took a lot of time with me, going through my blood work line by line. I was so please that she suggested supplements and knew about things that I learned from the Naturopath...but actually, she knew about more supplements than the Naturopath! So I was really pleased.  This is a great office and everyone is like family....they also treat you like you are a part of their family. They make your children feel comfortable too. There are tons of Mickey Mouse figures and videos for them to watch. The nurses have always loved on my daughter since she was a baby. They make sure that all of us have a productive appointment! I highly recommend this office."
5,"If you havent been to this place - go! Seriously. Its amazing. Its the best little hole-in-a-rundown-strip-mall you can find. And its cheap! Nestled between stores like Big Lots and some electronic place with Mexican ranchero music blasting, this tiny place is hidden in the corner. The owner is from El Salvador, so dont expect it to be Mexican food -- there are many similarities, but the dishes themselves are different. Walking in, you can smell the homemade pupusas -- seriously, it smells like the roadside stands along the bus routes in central America. Its amazing. There are only a couple waitresses, and I dont think they speak much English, but the menu is in pictures, as well as in Spanish and some English, so you should do just fine. Get the pupusas - theyre like thick, hand-made tortillas stuffed with either pork, cheese and beans or, my favorite, cheese and loraco flower, which is some green and edible plant that tastes a bit like asparagus, to me. Its definitely the best one. These things come with salsa and some coleslaw (if they dont, just ask for the salsa) and are very filling! The other dishes are really good, too. For a low price, you can get an entire plate of things like meat with rice and beans - and this place doesnt skimp on the fixins. They put slices of fresh tomatoes, avocado and all kinds of other stuff on the plates. I honestly LOVE it here. If you want to avoid the crowds, come at an off-hour... then you can just sit, relax and watch the telenovela on the TV in the corner. For dessert, pick up a piece of the cheese pie near the cash register. I cant recommend this place enough!"
5,"Love this place! Just went here and ordered the petite filet and lobster tail, everything is so good here. I also love the pork chop! My favorite dessert is the lava cake hot and yummy."
3,"I had a good time at Monkey Pants, we celebrated a buddy leaving for basic training. I will have to go back again. And the one oclock shirtless shot was awesome. Sorry I dont have more to report because I was drunk and dont remember much else, so that tells you it must be good."
5,"Oreganos is my FAVORITE restaurant in all of Tempe! The food is delicious - Ive never been disappointed by a single appetizer, entrée or desert! And since theyve recently add Blue Moon beer on draft I could stay here on the patio all day. Bonus: The wait staff is incredibly fun and friendly. Just a really great place to dine!"
5,"Red Velvet, Check Parking, Valet for Free, Check Ratpack ghosts, Check Fun People, Check Strong, yet good drinks, Check Good happy hour place, Check Been Around for Ever & Deserves it Rep, Check"
5,"little known secret- the golf course bar!!!!  amazing margaritas and a super-cheap happy hour.  didnt mind watching the cute guys checking in after a long day of golfing, either!  my bff and i were so happy to have stopped here after our day at the spa."
5,"Saw this place while I was picking up pizza for my kids.  I didnt want pizza thought I would go in and give the tamales a try.  I havent regretted that decision at all.  The chicken tamales are the BEST!  They are super spicy, the way I like.  The beef with red sauce is great too, not very spicy at all.  The masa in all the tamales is flavored wonderfully.  I am hooked on these tamales."
3,OH T.T.  at first you were intimidating...all these crazy people fumbling out of your doors....the odd screaming coming from the patio. Not to mention your lack of elbow room that causes your patrons to drunkenly shoulder check each other all night...but now ive grown to accept you. I dont love you yet...im still seeing other people...but i feel that we may have a future. see you soon T.T. like in a couple hours....
4,"My take on Mill street is that its your classic college-town main strip area with a couple bars with big TVs, a burrito place, a burger place, the quintessential late night grease-craving joint and a couple ""edgy"" ""boutiques"" selling overpriced Asian imports to tourists that will bite (guilty), and college students trying to reinvent themselves with ""hippie-chic,"" whatever the f that is. (Um, also guilty...) But I way digress! Streets like this also always have a couple more decorous dining establishments for when the parental units are in town -- which is exactly what I happen to have stumbled upon in this place, and perfect because if theres anything I love as much as edgy ""hippie chic,"" its decorum. I treated myself to my one sit-down meal during a week of travel/ being late for everything/ conference bagged lunches, and cant think of much more to have asked for than sitting outside on their little street-side patio with my glass of rosé and my truffle oil pizza. Granted Ive had better rosé and more perceptive service, but man, truffle oil. Self indulgent afternoon success."
5,"Teresa S. and I were one of the lucky ones to win tickets to see Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci last night at the Symphony Hall, and we were impressed with the acoustics. The overall sound quality of the live act was fantastic, so overall Id say that the gig was pretty amazing. Its a fabulous hub of culture, but the food concessions need some urgent attention. The only munchies they have are desserts like cookies or pies, so be sure to have dinner first. One of the great things they offer is you can now pre-reserve your intermission drinks. You can pre-order your favorite libation before the show, and they will have them ready on the refreshment table.  That would save you time in case you need to whiz to the loo, and not have to wait in line again to buy your drinks. Thank you again to Yelp and Arizona Opera. The show was wonderful."
2,"I had eaten breakfast twice at the Chandler Chompies and loved it so I wanted my husband to try them.  However, we went to the Tempe location instead.  Much older restaurant (pretty worn) and it took some time for me not to be grossed out by the nasty overall smell of the place.  My breakfast wasnt half as good this time and my husband didnt like his either - just boring and not repeatable.  Hoping hell give me another shot and well make the drive out to Chandler next time."
5,"I would not survive without Channel 8. i really dont watch much TV, but when I do, I want it to count. Let me see: Keeping Up Appearances, Coupling, RedDwarf, Antiques Roadshow, NewsHour, Nova, This Old House, Dr. Wayne Dyer, Frontline, Horizon, Scientific American Frontiers, The War, As Time Goes By, Red Green. Plus, tons of responsible programming for kids in the am and afternoon. (I dont think RedDwarf and Coupling air on PBS anymore - but thanks to PBS for introducing me)"
2,"Happy Hour Review. We stopped by to try the much ballyhooed Happy Hour and were were pretty damn underwhelmed.    First of all, I guess Im failing to see whats so happy about a $6.00 spicy tuna roll and $8.00 drink.  Secondly, like other non-japanese sushi joints in this town (cough, cough Ra Sushi), this is sushi for people who dont really like sushi.  Thirdly, seriously attitudinous staff, but one look at the uber-douchy clientele explains that.  Pass."
5,"This is such a beautiful stadium to go to and relax at, everything is so close that it only take 10-15 mins to get where you want to be, and on top of that, there is westgate shopping center that is right there with all the bars and night clubs to go to after the games. I recommend UOPX Stadium over any other in the valley because its clean and any seat in the house is a great one.!!!!Plus the weather is always great!!"
4,"I wanted to check this place out as I had got my mother in law a gift certificate for here...  It is what appears to be an old farmhouse that was left standing in the middle of Scottsdale busy city life..  The inside is very charming, like stepping into someones home with all the good smells of cooking.  We didnt make reservations and since it was a Sunday, knew we were pushing it, especially with the after church crowds.  But as luck should have it, was able to sit outdoors and was such a nice sunny day, was great.   I had the Chicken, wild mushroom and leeks crepe..was that ever heavenly!  My husband the strawberry chicken salad, which he also enjoyed..  One thing that drew my attention was that there were a lot of women senior citizens...very well dressed ones...obviously part of the Scottsdale upper crust..I think we were the youngest ones in there.. Next time Im back in Scottsdale will have to go back.."
5,"I live in the townhomes right next to this restaurant and it still took me 4-5 months to actually try it. Absolute blasphemy as I see it now. This is a charming little place, decor outdated enough that its sweet again, friendly servers, and man, great food. The pesto cream sauce ravioli (I believe) will blow you away. The wine glasses are filled high. Everything is great quality. Prices are medium-range, most dishes ranging from $11-18 but coming with a salad or soup and bread. This would be a great, great date night spot."
5,Amazing place wish i lived in Phx so i could have this EVERYDAY!
4,"Pretty good food. Super friendly service. Very clean. First time I have had duck at a buffet and it was pretty good, just not the crispy skin. Lot of seafood items. They kept things well stocked and didnt just dump the new stuff into the old (a health code violation) They pulled the old pan out and put the new one in.  We will definitely be back."
5,"Yes, it is a biker bar.  And it is packed with them at certain times, especially weekends.  I dont ride. But if you roll in on a weekday around noon you might not see any, and if everyone seems to know everyone its because they are all friendly local folks. So if youre visiting Cave Creek dont assume the Hells Angels are there looking to kick ass   Most of the ""bikers"" probably drive BMWs during the week.  I stop in at least once a week for a bite.  The food is the best bar food in Cave Creek and the service is awesome. Ive been to every bar in town. Harolds , The Chip, Toad, etc. all are good, but The Hideaway is the best."
4,"Another wonderful little counter joint.  Its extremely basic, no frills, and cheap.  The baklava isnt fabulous, but everything else is worthy of a special trip.  Once again, the chicken shawarma draws me in, though Ill occasionally force myself into breaking out of that far too predictable mold (for falafel since I truly am stuck in a rut).  The hummus is great.  As mentioned, the salads mainly consist of iceburg lettuce, but they are not stingy with the feta and the dressing is amazing. There is night, semi-scrubby outdoor seating and the drinks are bottled or canned.  Last year I went with a group of friends for Valentines Day and there was a musician who was slightly too loud for the environment.  When something special is going on, the owner comes around and checks with the patrons to verify quality and whether or not the activity is enjoyable.  This is always a nice classy touch for a little dive. Its a rarer occasion that I find my way down there.  Lets be honest: I only go that direction for SMoCA, the Venue of Scottsdale, and EZ Tattoo.  Its not generally ""my scene"" and its definitely out of my way.  Any time I find myself doing something in downtown Scottsdale, however, dinner at Pita House prior to the main event is an absolute must."
5,"Blue 32 wins my MVP award. I practically lived at this place during the Giants World Series run, and loved every moment of it!  Despite the fact that I am still stuck in an orange and black-out World Series Championship daze (that will probably continue for at least another month or so), I must up the rating of this place to 5 stars because Blue 32 is now my favorite sports bar in all of Scottsdale. The service is top notch and the atmosphere is excellent for game watching. Here are the main two reasons why I will keep coming back here: 1. Food - This is the best bar food ever! You must try their onion rings, they are crazy delicious. Also if you arent in the mood for fried food they have tons of healthy options as well. 2. TVs - Sports fans, it doesnt get much better than this when it comes to TVs. Outstanding visibility from every angle of the restaurant. No sports bar in Scottsdale can compete with Blue 32s TVs. Go here for a game and you wont be disappointed. I decked myself out in orange and black, screamed, jumped around with excitement and just all around enjoyed myself while hanging out in the bar area during the games. Overall, Blue 32 is a high quality sports bar and youve got to check this place out! P.S. GO GIANTS! =)"
5,Overall I am a big fan of this place... first how can you beat a place that is BYO???!!!  You never have to worry about a bad wine list or paying too much because it is your own stuff...  I find the food excellent... they menu is not large and changes often...  but I have never had anything that I have no liked... the chef is defiantly 5 star and since you bring in your own wine the prices dont seem that bad... but it is not exactly cheap...  The only down fall of the place is that it is real small and has funky hours... I think it is only open Wednesday to Saturday.  I know that they take reservations and I would venture to say that is the only way to actually eat there... This is a nice place for special occasions or a date...
1,"Coffee-meh. Not great, not horrible. Scone-dry. Service-ridiculously slow. The night we were there (8/11), the owner came and asked a group of people (who were clearly having some sort of meeting) to stop talking because they were ""disturbing the guitar player."" Chased 8 paying customers (at least I assume they were paying customers; they all had drinks) out the door. Weird!! Dont think Ill be going back."
5,"Ok, I hesitated writing a review of this place because I like that its not busy, but I want the place to survive because I enjoy it so much.  I hate gyms...I mean LOATHE them. From rude staff to unpleasant odors or creepy guys giving you longing looks while youre just trying to figure out which one of your friends with an advanced degree in engineering you can text to help you figure out how to get on a machine without having it rip your arm out of its socket because the staff is not going help you without paying for a personal trainer or because you dont look like you were already born on a nautilus machine.  This gym is everything but. I went in because of the great introductory special and a recommendation of a friend. Were both training to swim the SF Bay for the 2011 Sharkfest Alcatraz Swim, so we needed a pool.  As soon you walk in, the guy at the front desk treats you like youre an old buddy and cracks jokes like he is your best bar buddy. Awesome attitude. The place has never been overly crowded (even at peak hours right after work. Ive never gone during the early morning or lunch hours). No waits on the machines and they have plenty of them. No waiting in the pool and even when there is a water aerobics class, one lane is left open to due laps. Hot tub, sauna, and some inexplicable walk in dunking tub (see, Im not a gym aficionado or else I would know what that thing is for). Towel service, locks, and even gym shorts available. (no more using that excuse that you cant work out today because you left your work out clothes at home...they have some to check out there.) Even the seemingly cranky old lady doing her water workout was nice and called me sweetie and asked if I was ok when I inadvertently let out a puppy like whimper as my shoulder blades decided they wanted to cede from the union of my body. Note to self....dont do a month of the P90X with a friend, think youre hot stuff and on your way to a gym bod and then jump in a pool to do a mile swim without stretching because you think youre all that now. Had it not been for Grandma Water Aerobics, I might still be at the far end of the pool trying to inch my way back to the stairs hoping that the water on my face hid the tears that were going start gushing any minute if I couldnt make it to the hot tub to get my back to stop seizing up.  (Thank you, unknown Water Aerobics lady. You turned a moment of shame into motivation. Oh yeah, I will out swim grandma next time!) The place is in the basement of an office building next to the seemingly abandoned Chateaux on Central development. Central and....Encanto (?)  You can park on the street (careful of the meters) or use the garage. The gym validates.  There is a downstairs weight room (I havent check it out yet as I because there is a free gym at my job.) Yes, I like this place so much, I am paying for a gym membership even though I have access to work out facilities for free in my own building....including free personal trainer....but instead I get in my car come 5pm and drive to a gym I pay for because this athletic club is worth it.  I saw no young kids running around. The clientele seems to be early  30s and up, young urban professionals and some retirees who are just trying to stay healthy. No creepy people ogling you (which you may be looking for) and no rude gym bunnies laughing at you in your leotard on the treadmill....but really....you shouldnt have the leotard and hot pink leg warmers on anyway...it is 2010.  But hey, to each his own."
4,"I have been to RA a handful of times for happy hour, and was always annoyed by the loud music and crowd.   However, this time I went here for happy hour as a first stop for a Bachelorette party and I had a great time. The upbeat social atmosphere was great for getting the night started. The group ordered a ton of appetizers and rolls, and even a drink each, and we walked out at about $30 a piece. The elderberry mixed drink was especially good. Normally, I do not pick this place for sushi happy hour because I dont like their quality of sushi and like quieter placed to relax with a friend or two. But if your going for a fun group atmosphere, this place is perfect. But only during happy hour, otherwise it is definitely not worth the price."
4,"True, you throw your peanut shells on the floor. And yes, my Asian family has gotten some curious looks when weve ventured here.  ALL worth it. Great steaks, the sides that come with the meal are SMASHING, and the sweet bread rolls and cinnamon butter? Those are worth the trip alone, for reals. The portions are huge - and you know how sometimes food tastes worse when made in large quantities at restaurants? everything is still really good (I recommend the house salad and the chili). Did I mention that bread? We always ask for a basket refill and then take it home. haha. My familys go-to restaurant for a good steak dinner. I could do without the hokey Western thing, though. Yeah, not much for theme dining."
3,"Food was good, I had the Frutti de Mare with red sauce and boy it is spicy, so be warned. Everyone else ordered the Spaghetti Pie, which was the special that night. It was OK, my moms is better. The service was good, but the wait for a table was over an hour. Of course if was a Saturday night and they are having Glendale Glitters so it was really busy. The pizza is good, I have had it before, I am not the biggest wood fire pizza fan, because it is always burned on the bottom!"
5,Huge Fan of this place. People in the food industry should take a lesson from these guys as they have great customer service. Huge fan of the sandwiches.
5,"Great beer, Good atmosphere, Non annoying music and great wait staff make this my favorite place to spend an evening."
5,"Michael came out today and he was great! Our patio door was a bear to open and he put new hardware on and voila! It seriously opens with 1 finger. He was quick, affordable, knowledgeable and very nice. Scheduling was easy and the office staff was kind. A+!"
5,"I LOVE Chic Nails! I used to go to Tip & Toes on 48th street and Ray Road, until one day they were ""too busy"" to take my friend and I in for pedicured. We discovered Chic Nails and have been doing all of our manicures and pedicures there since.  The staff is extremely friendly and they give the best pedicures for a very reasonable price. I highly recommend this nail salon over any other! P.S. It is extremely close to CKs Bar & Grill to go for happy hour after! :)"
3,"Great food, bad service. Does anyone speak english in here?"
4,"I love this quiet location right of I-10.  Their selection is exactly as reported online, and the online orders I placed are always ready for pickup when they are supposed to be.  Parking is wide open, service is good, and the area isnt overpopulated yet so its always relatively quiet here."
4,"So, I avoided this place like the plague for the longest time.  No reason really, it just never caught my attention.  It always seemed to be empty, which led me to believe it must not be that great.  Well, dont judge a book until you walk in and try the spaghetti!  The Bollo Neapolitan has been my favorite pasta so far and the steak sandwich is to die for.  Im telling you- I never order steak sandwiches and I fell in love!   Ive tried a few of the other pastas and they were ok, but the Bollo Neapolitan was my fav with the runner up being the Garlic Shrimp Pasta. Now for the Negatives.  The chicken on the pasta just never really tastes right to me.  I dont know what it is, but it has a very gamey taste.  The dishes Ive tried without chicken have been far superior in my view.   Finally, Ive never seen this place packed.  That can be a negative or a positive depending on my mood, but I would like to see a few more patrons.  So, if you dont want to wait in line at the other Italian joint in the AMC 30 complex (Macaroni Grill) or are looking for a non chain option, check out Neapolitan! The service has always been great too. Bottom Line: Im glad to finally have a decent Italian choice when going to the movies at AMC 30."
2,"Had a very disappointing experience today.  All four in our group were disappointed in the quality of the food, especially the overripe cantaloupe and soggy potatoes.  The place was busy which wont be the case much longer if they dont improve their fare.  The service staff was friendly although I thought it interesting that no one asked us about our experience.   If they were interested, now they know."
4,"Unlike Cassandra, I love kids and brought 4 of my own to Joes. We all loved it. Fresh tasty food, great outdoor seating and lost of room for the kids to play with all of those dogs etc. The ahi tuna was cooked right and the slaw on it was amazing. The french fries might be the best I have ever had. The Chocolate shake was good but a little too rich for my taste. My wife said that the Buffalo chicken sandwich she ate was the best chicken sandwich ever. Her ice tea was amazing. My eldest daughter had the grilled peanut butter and banana split which had chocolate chips, pineapple, strawberries and of course peanut butter that was very different but great! The only drawbacks were the sweet potato fires ( not bad but I have had much better) there was only one condiment and drink area and that was clear on the other side of the fairly large area of land and the lone garbage can was also quite far. The pluses obviously are the tasty fresh food and of course plenty of room for kids to play and bother Cassandra."
5,"Stop everything youre doing and go get one of their brownies, warmed up, with an ice cold glass of milk. Ill never be the same."
5,"This is my favorite hotel of all time, so far, at least of the Kimpton ilk. I experienced nearly impeccable service and a super comfy bed, organic and local products, a lovely shower, and general happy relaxation. I love that the gym and pools are open 24 hours a day. The decor, half Asian deco and half Southwestern, works works works."
1,"This was a terrible experience.  You can not reach anyone via phone, you have to book online, which I did and also requested a phone call.  I rcvd no call and had an email in my email confirming a time for cleaning.  I requested a call then and got a reply stating someone would call me in 15 mins.  Still no call.  The cleaners arrived & I had someone let them in.  When I returned they were to clean the bathrooms & they were TERRIBLE TERRIBLE!  The sinks were dirty, with tooth paste splatters on sink, the inside of the shower had brown marks from some sort of un rinsed product.  I am so unhappy about this.  I have tried to reach them every day since & have not recieved a call back from a voice mail or email.  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY THEY ARE AWEFUL!"
3,"Good food, but I dont care for the SUPER FAST waitstaff. Fast is one thing, but walking away while I am still trying to order is RUDE."
5,"After a night of debauchery with friends, my friend and I found ourselves craving a comforting bowl of Pho. Ive been a regular at Cyclos for quite sometime but decided to branch out and try something new. I was pleasantly surprised with Pho Ao Sen! I am always happy when I enter an Asian restaurant and see Asians patrons...probably sounds a little weird but to me it speaks volumes. The tranquil aesthetics of this quaint cafe made us feel welcomed and relaxed. The decor had a modern Asian feel: minimalistic organic zen with soft ambient music playing - perfect for a Sunday afternoon. We ordered the Pho Dac Biet Bo Vien- House PHOnomenal (House special combination of *sliced eye round steak, well-done brisket, well-done flank, soft tendon, tripe, and beef meatball) and the Pho Tai (Sliced eye round steak) and Goi Cuon- Spring Rolls. As with most Vietnamese restaurants the portion size of Pho is quite large and we could have shared. Both were delicious, filling, and had a nice aroma but nothing too overpowering. Ive experienced a few places that use a little too much anise, so much that you cant get an overall sense of all the delightful herbs and spices used in this delicious creation. The Spring Rolls had a very fresh crisp flavor and were the perfect accompaniment to the Pho.  I give Pho Ao Sen 5 stars! Best Pho Ive had in the valley, beautiful atmosphere and friendly staff makes me one happy girl! :)"
3,"I have have given it 3 stars, but my partner gave it 4, just keep that in mind. I had wanted to check this place out from the first time I saw it, and when it came up on Groupon, it was fate. My partner is a sandwich lover, so it was perfect. Firstly, they didnt have a lot of vegetarian options, which I found disppointing. Im so sick of my only sandwich choices being either tomato/basil/mozz or lettuce/tomato/cheese...and thats pretty much what they had here. I went with the caprese option. Warning; when they say fire roasted tomatoes, they mean WHOLE tomatoes on bread. Now, Im ok with a few tomato slices here or there, but giant squishy tomatoes looming over a few spare pieces of (fresh) basil and (fresh) mozzerella? So not appetizing. I ate what I could, but was not impressed. My partner, however, made her own sandwich with Turkey, cheese, and some veggies, and she loved it. I agree that the bread was good, and I enjoyed the popcorn chips (rather than potato). The staff was incredibly nice, although the service was a bit slow, and the seating options were a bit odd (and not very accessible for those with disabilities). I wouldnt PLAN on coming here, but if we were in the neighborhood, Id stop by."
1,"We went to American Junkie after we found a 50% discount from http://www.restaurant.com. They couldnt pay us to go back. If you like velvet ropes, not being able to talk to the person next to you because the music is so loud, and being around people who are really into themselves, American Junkie is your spot."
2,"The service at this location was great, until one of the servers managed to incorporate throwing up in into a conversation while I was nursing a hangover. Never a good idea to talk throwing up to a customer that is eating.duh!! This conversation led to more inappropriate words from the employee until he finally left....grrrrr!!! Had the biscuits& gravy special ( $10.95 ), no bueno. I like my gravy simple...just some gravy with a little sausage running through,thats it. Cant stand it when there is onions, peppers, celery, carrot...yuck!! And they served those generic potatoes that are big flavorless cubes that they put in the deep fryer. Should have just had the chicken and waffle, lesson learned."
5,"Recently moved back to Mesa, I have been on the hunt for a place to get a good sandwich and fresh bread. This place now tops my list of places in the East Valley to get a good sandwich. My first sandwich was the Atlantic Haddock Provencal. A sandwich made with seared, lightly breaded haddock, sliced hard-boiled egg, fresh basil, romaine lettuce, tomato, Provencal tartar sauce on a grilled Brioche roll. The brioche was amazing. It was light and fluffy. The haddock was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of breading, and the vegetables were fresh and in perfect proportions as to not overpower the bread and haddock. Sometimes when you go to a sandwich shop they overload it with everything else that the meat and bread are just there to accessorize the vegetables and sauce. This was perfectly done. The atmosphere is pleasant and open with nice music as the light smell of fresh bread in the background salivates me. This is a must-visit lunch time destination. Dinner review shortly."
5,"Great little place in a great little neighborhood. Food was great, service good and friendly and sitting amongst the rose bushes and garden made one feel as if we were having a nice relaxing Sunday breakfast in our backyard. Love the place."
4,"So excited to have another Royal back in my life! I worked in downtown Phoenix before, and I was sad to see Royal leave back in the day. I never made it to Royal at the Market - sadly I reverted back to corporate America coffee after Royal left downtown.  Luckily, Biltmore Fashion Park has been really pushing the opening of this coffee bar at the Red Door spa. After waiting for it to open, I finally went down there today. Sure, they are just opening, so theres some kinks. Today they didnt have a ton of syrup selections, including my favorite almond rocca. However, theyre getting them all in very soon! AND they offer almond milk - how awesome! Theyve got three benches inside too. Although its pretty small, and awkwardly has an elevator leading up to the Red Door spa, I think its a pretty cool space. Cant wait till they get up and running and bring some decent coffee to the Biltmore. Great hours too - open early!  ***If youve never had Royal before, please go try it.*** I think their lattes have a very unique flavor, something I havent found in any other coffee joint. I cant believe I didnt drive to the Market location before this - but now I have something closer! Some tips - park by the Capital Grill and the big red door (duh). Luckily they have a Royal at the Biltmore sign on the window, or else I might have missed it. Itd be awesome to nab a 20 minute spot outside Mojo Yogurt too. They have a token validation machine, so dont be afraid to park in the token lot!"
4,"Ive eaten at this Smashburger a few times and Im always pleased with my food and the friendliness of the staff.  On my most recent visit, I called ahead to pick up my familys order and we were not disappointed, once again.  We ordered a variety of menu items (and in typical When Harry Met Sally... style) - a grilled chicken spinach and goat cheese sandwich (subbing the goat cheese for American & changing the multigrain bun to egg), a build-your-own burger with an egg bun, spicy chipotle mayo, pickles and onions, an order of Smashfries, an order of french fries and an order of fried pickles.  Everything was made perfectly to order and plenty of extra sauces (ranch, etc;) were provided without having to ask.   On weekends, this shop is jam packed and its a wait to get a table, but worth it.  During the week, everything flows very smoothly and the vultures ""circling"" for booths is at a minimum.   I highly recommend this Smashburger location whether dining in or taking taking your meal on the go."
4,"It takes a lot to impress me.  I hate most everything unless a place is so awesome it blows my friggin head off.  Sign of the whale accomplished this task.  Allow me to elaborate... The first time I went here, I received awesome service.  Did not have a bad thing to say about the place.  Was waiting for my party to arrive and sat by myself.  The bartender was awesome, started bullshitting with me and making me feel more than welcome.  The owner is always walking around the place, making sure things are cool with ALL of his customers.  Seriously, all of them.  The guy kind of reminded me of Eugene Levy from the original vacation movie.  I almost expected him to try and sell me a Metallic P.  Anyway, the guy was cool as hell.  Making sure everything was good with our food and drinks. Now the drinks... Wow.  They dont cheap out on the pour with these bastards, and they are not overpriced for what you get.  I have no complaints about the strength of these things, and that is always my first test if a bar is worth a shit.  if you own a bar and I have talked shit about the strength of your drinks, I invite you to go to sign of the whale.  I practically challenge you, like we should meet at the flag pole after school challenge you.  Let them show you what having a dick is like and how a drink should poured.    I hooked the bartender up on the tip, he deserved it.  I would go as far to say that I would almost take a bullet for that guy.  If I had a vagina, I would probably offer to father his children.  Well, that isnt true.  If I had a vagina, I would spend all day looking at it in the mirrior, but you understand what I am getting at.  You are as sexy as a Ferrari, good sir. The food...  Damn.  Goddamn.  Who the hell is the cook there, Emeril?Only had appetizers because they were on the cheap but between three of us we had 4 orders of appetizers and left full.  And I am fat.  Not quite Paul Blart Mall cop, but more of a Corey Haim 2007 era.  Regardless, want a great place without giving you any shit and keeping you drunk for less, hit this place up.  It is like a high priced hooker for half off, you cant go wrong.  The only gripe I have about this place is they seem to be a Green Bay Fudgepackers bar, but I guess no one is perfect! Hit this bitch up."
5,A great family owned restaurant! Their lunch specials are very reasonable. I recommend this place to anyone looking for good Japanese food. My only request is that they open a restaurant closer to Tempe - I would go so much more often.
4,"So now Ive been to two Ski Pros in the Valley and Im pleasantly please with both of them when it comes to their merchandise. I havent rented from them yet, but if their selection of clothing has anything to say about what they offer then I approve!  From Spyder, to North Face to Columbia, they have everything to choose from. The ski clothes are adorable and trendy. And the best part? The sales! They have a continuous sale going on it feels like, and the rumor on the street is that a huge sale is coming in February. Count me in!"
4,"I like that we have a sports venue in the West Valley, I think that this place has tons of more potential but under the current recession it will take time to recover and get the growth we need all around this place.  I love that Cabelas is over here and 2 movie theaters nearby.  I enjoy the food options when we are in this area and sometimes drive out of my way to come here since Park West is also nearby on 101 & Northern.  We came here this weekend and the kids walked around with us and we enjoy all the fountains and the kid area where children can play in the water."
1,"i called them and they wanted to charge $30 for fingerprints!!!!!  What a joke.  I found a place on the other side of the air park who did it for $10.  Caveat Emptor!  If if could give them a zero rating, I would have. On the other side of the airpark off of Greenway-Hayden loop is Global Pi Security.  $10 for prints. Their address is 7807 East Greenway road, suite 9, Scottsdale, Az.  globalpi-security (dot) com.  Good luck."
1,"I parked in the Parking Garage, got my parking ticket validated, and still owed money for parking.  The parking validation was worth $3.00.  The charge for parking was $5.00 with $2.00 credit for the validation (not the $3.00 I was promised).  I paid the remaining $3.00 charge, but then, the machine wouldnt give me a receipt. I am never going back to this location.  It is off my radar from now on."
4,The food was what one would expect from the outside. Mels is not a hole in the wall place with amazing food. Its diner with decent food for decent prices. I wouldnt go out of my way to eat there. Its nearby so I go. Sadly they had no T-shirts for sale.  One would think that they would capitalize off the TV history.
5,"Great new addition to the Old Town neighborhood. Citizen is versatile -- the perfect place for a romantic date, a small gathering, or for just meeting a buddy for a drink. A place with a great vibe. My first impression was that they are intently focused on service quality. Lots of smiling staff to greet you as you enter. Every employee is attentive to every table. Our server was gregarious, accommodating, gracious, and highly proactive. We definitely felt the warm and fuzzy atmosphere. They pay attention to the little things -- such as house-made ketchup for your french fries.  The food: about as good as upscale bar food is going to get. For apps we started with the calamari and the crabcakes. Portions werent large, but very high quality. The calamari was flash-fried and not greasy, and seemed very fresh. For my entree I had the wagyu burger, which was prepared perfectly and served on a fresh challah bun. Overall impression: Citizen will have staying power, unlike many establishments that open in Old Town. The formula is really pretty simple -- offer high quality stuff, equip the place with great staff, and dont go overboard with prices. Im looking forward to returning!"
4,"Ive got mixed feelings about at&t... just as Im sure that most people have mixed feelings about their mobile carrier.  But this review isnt for at&t as a company, its just for the Scottsdale store where I stopped in recently to return a phone. Long story, but I had a temporary android phone and hated it.  After hours (literally hours) on the phone with at&t customer service, I worked it out so that I could return my android phone at this store and then head over to the apple store with my upgrade eligible status to get the new iPhone.  That part is another story, and took longer than expected, but luckily, I did have a decent experience at this store thanks to the help I received from Hasen, the retail sales consultant that helped me out.  I hope there isnt really ever a need to return to this store, but if you must go, ask for Hasen... he was friendly, answered my questions, and provided the service I was seeking in a speedy yet attentive manner."
5,"I cant say enough good things about this place.  Quick disclosure: When I was working for the Downtown YMCA, I discovered Local Breeze as I was searching for businesses to participate in our fund-raising campaign. Local Breeze was totally down to contribute. So on top of getting that delicious meal, know that your money is largely going back to the community. Awesome. But the food (and drinks) are really what keep me coming back. The coca-cola ham is delish, and the serving sizes are pretty decent. You definitely get your moneys worth. And theres a reason why my profile says that my ""recent discovery"" is ""spiced cottage cheese from Local Breeze."" That was written months ago, but I dont think Ive discovered anything quite as amazing yet. And I normally dont even like cottage cheese. The last time I went was for my bday dinner, and again, it didnt let me down. We had good food, good drinks, and a good time in general. The bartender mixed up this killer cucumber martini, which sounds weird, but if youre a martini fan, go for it. If youre feeling less risky, you cant go wrong with their mojito."
4,"I went here last night with my wife to celebrate our 2 year wedding anniversary.  We purposely arrived early to have a drink at their bar.  There wasnt much of a selection on their happy hour drink menu so we just ordered our go-to drinks.  Champagne for her and a martini for me.  The hostess/waiter/waitress were very friendly and prompt.  When we were ready for dinner we were brought to the main dining area and our bar tab was transferred without trouble. I made a reservation a few weeks prior and made a notation that it was our anniversary.  Upon arrival at our table there was a card saying happy anniversary which was a nice touch.  The table was smack in the middle of the dining room so my wife asked if we could move to another table.  The host was very accommodating and gave us a better table. The place is pretty sheik to the eye but uncomfortable.  The 2-top tables are small, too close to other people, and I dont want to sound like a 90 year old, but the chairs are ridiculously uncomfortable.  I dont know about you but I like to eat my too expensive meal in utter comfort.  The noise level is also above where it should be but they were playing some pretty solid tunes throughout the night. Our waitress was excellent and knowledgeable but was taking care of way too many tables which made her unable to come around as often as I would have liked.  I especially liked our sommelier who gave us an awesome wine recommendation.  Also, Im not sure if this is all the time or not, but all bottles under $300 were 1/2 price so we splurged on a more expensive bottle than we would have normally purchased. The Food: * Fries - they give these to you instead of bread.  They are excellent especially the truffle ones.  My only issue is that you could tell they were sitting out for a half hour before being served to us.  I would have liked them fresh but whatever. * Wedge Salad - just ok.  The blue cheese and bacon were great though.  It just wasnt the typical steak joint wedge I am used to and was looking forward to. * Burrata Cheese - this was very unique to me and pretty good * Truffled Mac n Cheese - not the best Ive ever had but still pretty good.  Not as thick and cheesy as I would have liked and they use weird noodles. * Wagyu Beef Trio - My wife and I shared this.  Perfect amount for the both of us to share.  Each 4oz piece of steak was perfectly cooked, juicy and delicious.  I still cant tell the difference between regular beef and wagyu though.  The sides were also very good.  We especially liked the mushrooms.  The mashed potatoes were too creamy and just eh. * Beignets - we shared these for desert and they are fluffy, sugary awesomeness.  The sauces are equally awesome. All-in-all it was a fantastic meal and great experience.  Good food, good wine, good company.  I would come back any time to enjoy a steak or one of their burgers."
4,"Very good food.  Our service was great--thank you, Heather.  She guided us to some good wines and food recommendations.  Well be back"
3,"If you happen to get lost and wander by the gun show at the Coliseum, be sure to stop here. A little whole in the wall of a former Wendys, this place rocks the steak taco world. My favorite is the ""jaz"". Carne asada + cheese + peppers/onions = yum!!! The barbacoa and chicken tacos are tasty, but I wouldnt say theyd knock you off your feet. Definitely go carne asada and defintely try this place."
3,"Lets just set the record straight here. Zoes serves Mediterranean just like Qdoba serves Mexican. When I say just like the Q, I mean the entire experience. Walking into the shop gives more of a cookie cutter national chain feel; which is probably because they are in fact a chain of restaurants. Zoes food was average and unimpressive. I did like the hummus though. Their prices similar to independent and family operated Mediterranean around the valley; in some cases more. I would prefer to visit Cypress Grill, just up the street from this location, theyre my favorite Medi in CenPho so far.  The staff here was friendly, they took our order promptly and served the food within a few minutes. Dont get me wrong, the food was in no way ""bad"", per se. I just cant shake the feeling of ""Ive had better"" when thinking about my experience. If youre looking to fill your belly with food just because its time to eat, this might just be the place for you. If youre interested in a great Mediterranean meal, I implore you to please try something new. I likely wont be returning, we do live in the city of a million restaurants, go out and choose one! (but dont take me at my word on that just made up fact). Happy Yelping Phoenix, now wheres my hummus?"
4,"We had a pretty darn good time. Decided to take my two nieces to the festival.  Our total cost for 3 of us w/ 2 bracelets before food and extras was $64 - and the girls got on almost every ride, even the big, scary ones!  We went on a Friday at 4ish and the crowd was perfect and relaxed.. absolutely no lines.  Come 6pm, though, that all changed.  The lines got big and it started to not matter to get our bracelets worth of rides for the wait in line (plus the cold night air!).  Also, come 6pm, it just got plain ridiculous with all these little high school kids wearing skimpy clothes and making out and talking bad (where are these kids parents!?!.. who raised these kids!?!).. it got annoying real quick. The shows: - Ostrich Race at 6pm was good - kinda funny, but not that entertaining - Monkey Show at 9pm was AWESOME - I saw this show last year when we went with the in-laws and I *still* laughed my butt off (easily amused maybe?) - Petting Zoo - LOVE this.. they had a lot of baby goats (my fave!) and the animals were never menacing and actually very docile. - In the past I saw the trapeze show and it was entertaining, though the motorcycles in the metal sphere was quite impressive and very entertaining Overall, the price was decent for the entertainment and the rides the gals got to enjoy; the food was typical fair food (FYI, DO shop around.. prices change across similar products by 2-3$ sometimes, so feel free to shop around for water bottles and other food staples); the staff running the rides were decent people (not creepy, which can be the status quo); the ambiance is good (not OVERLY ghetto) but caution that after 7pm, it gets more crowded with high school kids.. so more lines and more stupid conversations you get to listen to.. yay!"
2,"waitress wasnt good with service. mongolian beef dish sucks. fish is just ok. rock bottom is usually pretty good, but this one in scottsdale is not that great."
4,"Im a horrible haircut customer. I never remember how I get my haircut and squared or rounded, I just dont keep track. Ive been to all of the chains and was thinking that maybe I should finally find just one person to cut my hair for now on until I got a coupon. I really enjoyed my visit, I didnt get the MVP thing cause I wasnt expecting it and I didnt have time for it. They are all pretty knowledgeable and quick. Only once was I not fully happy with the cut, but its hair it grows back. They are a bit more pricey but I always go with a coupon, I get them every month. Im not the most talkative person so it gets kinda awkward when you sit there in silence so I love that you can just sit there and watch sportscenter."
5,"I love this place! Everything about it! The great food, the grocery section, the cramped seating (it gives character). It all goes together perfectly. Havent found one bad thing yet:)"
4,"I must admit, Im more of a Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market guy (due to the economy), but I had a great time shopping at AJs. Every single item on the shelves is of the highest quality. For Valentines day, because Im so bad at picking out girly gifts, I let my girlfriend go on a shopping spree at the chocolate counter (among other things)...Id go back once in a while, but did grimace at the checkout counter when I forked over $125 for three bags of crap...I guess its back to mayonnaise sandwiches at Neighborhood Market."
5,"i absolutely LOVE maxim and i have eaten there approximately 2 times a week since i learned about the restaurant a year ago.  the atmosphere is pretty awful, but the food is amazing.  i get a #86, which is a noodle, tofu, and vegetable soup (the broth is meat based).  it is comforting and cheap and always improves a bad day.  everyone i have taken there has enjoyed the food as well (though they tend to enjoy the vietnamese dishes more than the chinese ones). highly, highly recommended."
5,"i think this food is phenomenal. this was the first place i tried asian food in AZ when moving out here years ago. it has grown since then and the food is always top notch.  for a late sunday afternoon lunch, the place was nearly empty but their takeout counter was constantly busy. our server was friendly and attentive and kept our water glass filled.  its been a while since i ate for the review for which i write so i dont remember exactly what it was, but it had the big, wide rice noodles which i love. i do remember that the dish was excellent and big enough to supply leftovers for lunch the next day.  they ask how spicy and ive eaten thai food ""spicy"" and it is downright dangerous, so we opted for ""medium"" with a side of spice juice...which was HOT! we will continue to patronize Totties as they are consistent and the food and service has always been very, very, very good. and very reasonable prices."
3,"I was not impressed. For a business traveler, there are better choices nearby.  When I drove up, the valet told me there was no self park, but I could see it less than 100 yards away from my room. I used it during my stay, and it was convenient and much less expensive.  The entry of the hotel was constantly blocked by party goers, and I couldnt find any alternate entrance/exit.  My bill was wrong at checkout. They adjusted it, but then mysteriously placed an additional unauthorized charge of $13.94 on my credit card.  Seriously wishing I opted for Embassy Suites across the road..."
2,"We were very disappointed with this place. We drove over to Tempe, to a blasted out, deserted shopping center that looked like it closed due to a depression, and there it was in the corner, still open while everything around it was closed. Its a nice little spot inside, comfortable enough. This is another one of those places that thrives on the Groupon phenomenon. Prices are jacked up to accommodate a discount. I bought a $6.50 bottle of beer (as one example). My pizza, a sausage pie, came out burned. I know that a good pizza has a ""flame kissed"" look to it, even at top places like Biancos. But this pie was flame-licked, and theres a difference. I tasted charcoal more than I did sausage.  The folded and stuffed Calzone was not burned, but neither was it stuffed so full that its busting its seams which is the way we like it. Lots of air inside this Calzone. Illl take the dramatically less expensive Calzone at Mama Mias on Indian School any day over this hot-air filled version. The service was good, with a very friendly waitress helping us out. She should have noticed the burnt pie, however. If they reduce the inflated Groupon prices, Id go back when they bring in some reasonable draft beer and start putting more care into their preparation of the food."
5,"NOTE: Ignore the reviews above. It looks as if there is some deliberate attempt by the Udupai owners to pose as members and bash this place. Yes, this owner used to own Udupai Cafe and Udupai Cafe is another dosa house that competes with this eatery.  If you read my other reviews, you know that Im critical and  my attention to detail is there so Im not one of these people who likes every place he eats at. Positives Im Indian and I can assure you this place is good. I have never been to Udupai Cafe but based on its failing health inspections, I would be scared to eat there. Woodlands is a nice CLEAN eatery in a nice part of Chandler.  Its not a restaurant.  Its basically a Dosa shop. They  specialize in Dosa and offer several types. They also have excellent Indian Chinese dishes.   The food is consistently good and I have eaten there on several occassions.  This is a lunch/light dinner place.  Dont think of this place like a restaurant.  There are several types of Dosa and thats what this place specializes in.  The restaurant is also modern and not is some ghetto strip mall so dont worry about failing health codes here...at least not for a while. Negatives Their non-South Indian dishes are not so good. For non-Indians, they should be informed that this is a Dosa house so order dosa and other south Indian dishes.  Dont order your typical Indian restaurant favorites like palak paneer (it wasnt good here).   The owner also says every dish is excellent which isnt true; he is kind of a businessman so he doesnt really care about telling you which dishes stand out.  Stick to the Dosa and the Vegetable Manchurian.  Their mango shake wasnt very good. Their chiku shake is great."
5,Best place in Arcadia to get a coffee or a tea. Lots of friendly locals and great place to sit outside to people watch and read the paper in the morning early lunchtime.
5,"This is a great place in an extremity of the Valley. They serve both Korean and Japanese food. They are quick and attentive. Having lived in South Korea for two years, I can honestly admit that this is some of the most authentic Korean cuisine Ive had in Phoenix. I typically ate bibimbap once a week minimum over there and I cant really tell the difference between Takamatsus version and the stuff I had on the other side of the Pacific. I noticed they offer a list of other, more obscure foods I learned to love over there, including naengmyeon (cold, spicy noodles), japchae (stir-fried glass noodles), and several other dishes. They also follow tradition and bring you several side dishes. Love it or hate it, kimchi accompanies every meal, as do spicy bean sprouts, a tangy spinach dish and a few other random sides. Its a little bit more expensive than average restaurant prices in the Valley, but definitely worth it when you consider the sides that come with it, and a complimentary spiced tea for ""dessert."""
4,LOVE this place.  The parking is terrible.  Thats what keeps me from being a regular. Coffee and deserts are SUPERB.  Atmosphere is A+. Love the gifts.
1,"This is my first year participating in Arizona to sell clothing, just wandering how busy its goona be in there ??? little worried, can any one reply me ??"
3,"A nice place to watch a game... nice that it is open enough that you can keep an eye on the game while you survey your many dining alternatives. I also they let some natural sunlight and keep the place cool at the same time. Anyway I dont have a good reason to give this place one star, or five stars, hence three stars."
2,"An interesting concept that didnt end up being what I hoped for.   I was pretty excited to try the Posh Noodles & Noshes Japanese street food as prepared by Josh Hebert.  I love Japanese food and was looking forward to the dishes that are not readily available in Phoenix.  Unfortunately I was underwhelmed by both the venue and the food. The location inside the Lexington Hotel has definitely seen better days.  An attempt has been made to create a temporary generic space with chalkboard walls and butcher paper topped tables.  However, it came across as worn and dingy. Our waitress was not familiar with the menu or drink offerings (I didnt work here last night) but was friendly and did find out answers from other staff.  Foolishly thinking that we would love each and every dish and take home a lot to enjoy the next day, we tried a large assortment.  An expensive mistake. Duck Gyoza w/ Ponzu - I prefer steamed gyoza over the fried presentation here.  Also, these had the tiniest, greasy portion of filling I have ever seen. Homemade Tofu w/ Ginger, Scallion, Cherry Blossom - this was good, with a sweet, dessert-like flavor but a somewhat runny texture. Okonomiyaki - this Japanese pizza was among the better items.  However, the texture of the ingredients was strange - i.e. full slices of bacon rather than smaller bite-sized pieces made greasier than it needed to be and messy to eat Tako Yaki - again, a strange texture with awkward large chunks of octopus surrounded by breading that fell apart easily The ramen dishes (Miso Ramen w/ Pork, Goma Ramen w/ Pork and Shitake Mushroom Rames) were small, and more or less indistinguishable from one another.   We left most of them behind, deciding not to take anything with us. The dessert, Green Tea Pot de Crème was a nice finish but did not make me feel better overall about the $100+ meal."
2,"I was so excited to try these cupcakes, but Ive got to say I was pretty disappointed, especially after waiting in quite a long line. I am a cupcake fiend, but they were not nearly as good as I thought they would be. I got 7 different flavors and I didnt think they were very sweet and, cake wise, they all kind of tasted the same. The frosting wasnt all that great either. My mother and kids tried them too, and didnt think they were all that great. Dont get me wrong, they werent awful, but Id never go back. I tried them and now Im done. Id rather save my money (and my time) and bake my own cupcakes."
4,"First, and most importantly, every person Ive met at QC Vet Clinic has been super!  They are caring and wonderful with my dogs.  They are never too busy to smile and give great service when I come through the door.  They have even taken time to share stories and pictures of their own pets. Second, they understand that some people must take a fiscally conservative approach with the care of their pets.  They discussed all options thoroughly with me and I performed the care that was needed a little at a time -- as it was needed.  This was important to me since many vets that weve visited in the past have handed us an estimate for hundreds or thousands of dollars and wouldnt budge -- insisting that we HAD to do ALL the work listed.  At QC Vet Clinic, I didnt feel like I was judged for that decision. Unfortunately, we had a small mistake that I discussed with the vet.  She listened and gave appropriate feedback to my concerns.  This is really the only thing that is preventing a 5 star rating.  Overall they are still the best vet Ive visited and I will continue to put my pets lives in their very capable hands. BTW, we had to have a pet put down because he was ill. The team at QC Vet Clinic was absolutely the best!  They were so empathetic and even sent us a sympathy card with a little surprise inside... I wont give it away, but it was so very special to my family.  Its the little things in life that fill our hearts...thanks QC Vet Clinic!"
3,"If youre heading to a show at the Scottsdale Center For The Performing Arts, this is your best convenient bet for dinner (if you like Indian food).  Its average but can probably satisfy your curry craving."
3,"Their salad bar here is lacking. I used to go to Whole Foods when I was too lazy to make anything to eat, but didnt want to be riddled with guilt about eating out.  The people who work here are friendly and they have a huge selection of canned veggies for salads, as well as other specialty items that may be harder to find out here. They also carry the largest selection of Amys Organic frozen foods that I adore. mmmmm tofu pockets..."
5,"Im giving them a 5 star review for how they handled a poor experience we had.  My family came here for my brothers birthday a few weeks back, and two of our four dishes came out undercooked.  We brought it to the attention of our waitress, who brought the manager Adrienne over.  They both apologized profusely and took the charges off of our bill, which is what I would expect.  We were polite and appreciative of their apology and really didnt expect or ask for anything else.  However, they also offered to give us a credit to come back another time so they could prove to us that it was just a one time mistake. We took them up on the offer, and sure enough the food was excellent the second time around.  Our server was fantastic, Adrienne came by to make sure we were happy, and the chef even came out to make sure we were pleased with the meal.  They really went above and beyond to make sure we left with a positive opinion of their restaurant.  Everybody makes a mistake once and awhile, but not everyone has such excellent customer service to correct it!  I will gladly return here as a result."
5,"Simply put this place is AWESOME.  If youre looking to start a business or already own a business but need some of the details on a particular area, this is the place to be.  So far Ive only attended a Brown bag lunch but I was thoroughly impressed by the people who were there. However, dont show up with out being ready to put in your two cents, its needed to keep the ball going, I thought it was really good.  I cant wait to go back!"
3,"Friendly reps, painfully high tire price quote.  Found em for $100 less, per tire while waiting for my car to be pulled up."
4,"This is the very first time I have ever been in here.This location anyway, the first one was in downtown Seattle.   Yes, I came with my girlfriend. Both times,but it is a cool place for men as well. Samples of colonge, creams ,lotions and anything else you have ever wanted to try.  They will even give you samples of things to take home. They will make you a sample of anything you would like to try. It can be challange to get inside the Scottsdale Mall at times. But, on this day it was not too bad,(during the week) and early in the day. It is a cool place,with lots to see and try. Loads of people wanting to help you as well."
1,"Rarely do I give a 1 star rating but after four attempts in four months to get my fax line and internet rolling I can honestly say they have earned this.  After finally showing up for a scheduled appointment the tech told us our internet was fine but we disagree because we are getting the same speed we had with Qwest in Cave Creek (SLOW)  and they are charging us $64 a month for what they call the upgraded 20mbs.  Furthermore, I tried to send out a couple faxes after he left and the line is not responding.  Im going to drive down to the store tomorrow and demand that they remove the fees for service I have not received and just get efax.  As I noted in the first review we were excited to upgrade to faster internet so that makes this experience even worse."
3,I ordered a thin crust pizza for carry out from this location.  The staff was very friendly and the pizza was pretty good.  I look forward to trying their pasta in the near future.
5,"This little spot in the art district of Scottsdale is as good a lunch restaurant as Ive been to.  I had the mahi mahi tacos, and was blown away by the attention to detail in the flavors bringing the dish together, as well as the wonderfully tasteful presentation.   Of particular note was the attractiveness level of the waitresses, about which I dont have sufficient words to do justice.  Both my father and I were hard pressed not to buy a condo in Scottsdale just to stay and have all our meals for the rest of our life there solely to appreciate the view.  They were dressed tastefully, not in the slightest bit slutty, but holy god."
4,"I read the reviews on Charlestons and decided to take the plunge even though there were a few negative reviews. I am a visitor to AZ for business and have grown so tired of restaurant food.  I love salad and find most places dont know how to make a decent salad, the one at Charlestons was so good with fresh tomato and egg and the creamy garlic dressing!! Yummy. The filet was medium well and I not being a steak fan usually need some type of sauce (except for Ruth/Chris), but this steak was really good. I took my meal to go and couldnt wait to get the hotel because it smelled so good. Last but not least was the baked potato. The salt on the outside, I quote someone else, ""genius"".  I used curbside to go - AWESOME. If you havent tried this place, go - despite the few bad reviews. I am now a fan and will do something I rarely do - eat the same meal two days in a row (I am not kidding, it was good!!)"
2,"I had to drop it down to 2 stars.  The food was the same quality, but they do not bring out big bowls of white and brown rice anymore.  They brought out 5 small bowls of rice when there are 7 of us.  Are we suppose to share or have our individual bowls?   We had our usuals: 2 chicken fried rice - ok 2 mongolian beef - good 2 chicken chow mein - good 2 crispy honey chicken - good 1 orange peel chicken - meh... 1 spicy chicken - too spicy for me, but the group said it was good Main reason for the 2 stars was the service SUCKED!  We had to literally get our servers attention for anything (refills, more rice, togo boxes, etc.).  We waited 15 mins for our server to pick up the check, he never showed!  So we handed it off to other server and asked if she can help us.  He came back to the table only the times we can grab he attention.  We were always out of drinks.  I have not had that BAD of a service in a long time.  I will not come back on my own, but if the family wants to then they can drag me along (kicking and screaming)."
4,"*Gamestop Burger* Visiting a friend in Phoenix I first see Smashburger from the street. Upon first glance my other friend and I thought it was a Gamestop cuz the sign looked just like it. We both said ""Haha, we thought that was a Gamestop."" Our friend goes, ""Yeah I first thought that too when I first saw it. Its pretty good there. Do you guys wanna go?""  So we ended up eating our first meal in Phoenix at Smashburger, and we were glad we did. The food was really good, and the smashfires were a great addition to our burgers. I ordered the BBQ Bacon & Cheese. It was quite delicious, and a little on the greasy side. BUT thats where all the flavor is!!!!! This burger has some hot steamy buns. Yeah I said it . Unlike most places that use the typical sesame seed bun Smashburger uses egg buns. These buns are a lot softer and compliment the burger very nicely.  I decided to order the smashfries which are seasoned with garlic and rosemary. These were an awesome choice. For those of you who may not like those flavors they offer regular fries as well.  Seeing that I hadnt eaten since morning I also ordered the Arizona devil dog. This had guacamole, tomatoes, jalapenos, habenero cheese and a spicy chipotle sauce all on an all beef hot dog. I liked it. It was like nachos minus the chips on my hot dog.  Now this place is on the pricey side, but if you feel like dishing out $8+ for a burger and fries then this place is not too shabby.  Different locations call for different items on the menu, so dont be surprised if the Arizona devil dog cannot be found outside of Arizona. I say that they should combine all the regional menus to make one giant-mega selection-awesomeness menu. But I highly doubt thatll happen."
3,Met some friends here for happy hour the other day.  This is the old El Paso BBQ and they did a knockout job with the remodel. Great feel and warm colors to the place now. I had a couple of Coronas and some chips and guacamole.  The regular menu looks better than the happy hour menu and think Ill try them the next time for lunch or dinner.
4,"Big fan of Hulas been a bunch of times, but finally was compelled to write a review.  Just came back from a week in Maui, so I was still in ""Hawaii-Mode"" (which is soooo hard to get out of lol), so I insisted we go to Hulas to get my Hawaii fix.  Mainly....that just means I was dying for a good Mai Tai. If you go here, you MUST order a Mai Tai.  While most of their drinks are pretty good and tropical tasting, the Mai Tai is the best in town (now that Trader Vics is donzo).  Im a Mai tai snob, and cringe when most mai tais here on the mainland are made way way way too sweet and fruity.  The Mai Tai at Hulas could rival some of the best in Hawaii in my opinion.  Mostly rum (white and dark) and just the right amount of sweet mixed with the right amount of tart/sour.  They go down great and they hit you with quite the kick before ya know it, so be careful ;-)! As far as the food...its good, but its not Roys so dont except anything amazing.  I usually get fish here, just to go with the whole Hawaiian thing.  Most of the times Ive had Mahi, it can be dry sometimes, but always tastes good.  Ive had both the wasabi crusted and the macadamia nut crusted, both are decent.  The Luau Pork plate is darn good, but my recommendation is get the Luau Pork sandwich instead.  It goes so much better on bread, than just by itself.  All the appetizers are great to munch on while youre enjoying your Mai Tai...all thats missing is Hawaiian music, and the sun setting over the ocean :)"
4,"I was toying with the idea of going on the wagon for a few weeks when I met my friend at The Mission, but the Sophia Loren cocktail caught my eye. My friend was intrigued by the Mexican Painkiller, and I couldnt let her drink alone. And oh, Im so glad Im such a good friend.  The Sophia instantly made my list as one of the best cocktails I have ever had - fresh strawberries and mint muddled in rum and another liqueur I cant remember. Just sweet enough to be refreshing. And plenty strong enough to make any hour happy. This drink defines the word elixir. It is as intoxicatingly unforgettable as its namesake."
3,"I think Marcellinos will get a second chance for a special occasion.  I visited the restaurant based on seeing it on Check Please Arizona.  The food is obviously made fresh and was excellent but I felt a little overpriced based on other excellent restaurants in the area.  Although the atmosphere was romantic, I had a hard time reading the menu and the bill using just the votive candle on the table.  There has to be a better way!"
5,Tried going there for my 1st visit and they were closed during hours they were supposed to be open.  Have tried calling them a few times during normal business hours and did not get anyone to pickup.  They may be closed for good.  Not sure.
4,Just recently drove by this Target. It was one of my favorites. Now its closed!
2,"They have good baked baguettes and the price was $1.50 last month, however raising the price to $2 per roll during the holidays is ridiculous.  The female cashier was short and unprofessional.  While i was waiting for the rolls, she was rude to the next three customers spending money.  They need to work on their customer service and I vowed never to go back."
4,"Ive been going to Unique since I was little.... when it was called Chic n Cheap. I always find at least one decent thing at Unique. Granted it doesnt have tons of great stuff, but it is a great stop on a shopping day. And this isnt a psudeo thrift store that more of a vintage store and therefore can charge non-thrift prices. Im talking shirts under a dollar. yeah."
5,"I have to tell you.... I had their Jerk Chicken Plate the other night, and it was yuuuuummmmmyyy! You gotta try it!"
2,"I have been to Las Glorias twice with people from work.  Both times I was underwhelmed.  The first time I went the service was good.  They were great about bringing out chips with salsa and bean dip and refilling drinks.  The second time I came the service was horrible.  We were there for over 1.5 hours because we had to wait for EVERYTHING and it was not very busy.  I was not impressed with the food.  They seem to put raw onions in everything, including the cheese enchiladas.  I really dislike raw onions and am a pro at finding dishes without them, but you cannot escape them here.  The rice and beans were good, but I cannot say much else for a positive about this place.  I will not be back!"
4,"Holy manfest 07. I think I was one of the 20 women (not including the waitresses) in Tilted Kilt yesterday. It was raining men.  And I liked it.  A few minutes after entering the bar, I knew exactly why I was surrounded by a sea of men- the waitresses were barely wearing any clothes.  Let me clarify: they did have tiny skirts on, even tinier tops and their bras were hanging out, so I guess that constitutes as clothes. The outfits were cute, but extremely revealing, so much so that even I had a hard time looking our waitress in the eye and I know the guys around me were having the same problem. The bartenders (all men) were all pretty cute. And wearing kilts.  All I kept thinking yesterday was that they must make some pretty damn good money to warrant wearing a skirt to work. The food is pretty good too and their menu is extensive.  Youll find the usual apps, sandwiches, tons of salads, chicken fingers, wings and so on.  But the real highlight of Tilted Kilt for me was when I found little purse hooks underneath the bar. I thought that was awesome.  Way to look out for the ladies Tilted Kilt."
5,"Pita Jungle is a staple favorite of mine and my boyfriends. Healthy, hearty and great service. Its too bad that a lot of their prices have gone up (as have other restaurants) but Ill still patronize this place. Read as: some things went up in price almost two dollars, but you can still have a meal and a drink for around $10, more or less, depending on what you order. I definitely like this place over the new one across MCC on Southern - theres something about being by the lake that makes it special. Even if there are stinky ducks there from time to time. ;) Ooh - and the gambas con ajos is my favorite appetizer! :)"
4,"I dabble in vegetarianism/veganism here and there, and this place is awesome.  This is a great restaurant for people who are not vegans/vegetarians and want to try it, or think vegan food is ""weird"" (in the words of a friend).  Everything here is flavored so well, and the dishes are delicious. I love all the apps, and have tried several of the entrees and thought they were all pretty good. They also have a fabulous selection of creative drinks. I hope this place sticks around for a long time, since it never seems to be busy when I go. The staff is very open and friendly and knowledgeable about the food, so never hesitate to ask if youre unsure about something!"
4,"The service here is wonderful. Let me start by saying that, our waitress (Im mad I didnt remember her name) waited on us on the patio. She was so nice and our friend can be a little overwhelming and has a strange sense of humor. She made sure everything we wanted we got. Even modified the desert special so we could have a hybrid of the white chocolate chip ice cream and a brownie dessert. My filet was wonderful and at a great price of 24 bucks... Me living in san francisco where filets cost 40 bucks a piece this was up to par. The corn salad is also worth mentioning, wonderful flavors. Anyway, I could have been happy with many items on their menu... Also, get the dragonberry lemonade it is on their specialty drinklist and is great on a hot day!!!"
3,"YogurtBuilderz provides a good sized dining area with many choices of yogurt and toppings. I did find it a little difficult to locate when I attempted to find the building - it is tucked away in the back corner of a strip mall parking lot. It was dark, late at night and took a few passes around the parking lot to zero in on the location. The staff was very friendly and the place was busy even for a Sunday night. For the staff and selection I give it a 3 star rating. It was good, but I didnt find it any different than the growing list of competition.  I know this place is popular and self-serve frozen yogurt establishments are all the rage now. The economic model is great - you pay by the ounce and have your choice of any variety of yogurt and any topping available. Customers have the opportunity to build it as they wish, which allows those with specific tastes to have their wants fulfilled more so than a traditional store offering the generic selection of choices.  All of that in mind, I dont like it (the industry). Too many choices creates an opportunity for indecision and slows down the lines as people stand around wondering what to put in it next. For those new to the game, you can create something that turns out to be rather nasty - for example, the white chocolate sauce is really very sweet and I find if mixed with other toppings makes it almost unbearable. The other reason I do not like these places is that I do not like to pay for food that I then have to make and serve myself. I go to restaurants and pay for a meal rather than cook it at home because a) I dont like doing it and b) I am horrific at it. While frozen yogurt does not require much preparation, there is still some assembly required. If I am paying, I prefer to have it built for me. But I realize I am in the minority. As popular as these chains are becoming I wouldnt be surprised to see ""FroYo"" overtake ""unfriend"" as word of the year in 2010."
5,"Careful! Youll get addicted. Angel Sweet is the best gelato this side of Italy. The pana cotta and zupa flavors are to die for. Dont settle for just one either, you can get as many flavors as will fit in your cup!"
2,"I had very high hopes for this place, after the very good reviews Fate got and that Sens has been getting, but I was terribly disappointed. The mango papaya spring rolls were dominated by the flavor of anise/licorice. The shu mai dumplings were so hard, even hard-core Italians would have said they were too al dente. The black dragon chicken was good, but not great. After we left, we noticed the dinner menu was much more extensive, especially without the tapas. Maybe dinner here is a much better experience, but Im not sure Id even be willing to give it a try after the lunch I had here. As for the atmosphere and decor - dont even get me started. Talk about trying too hard to be hip. The Vegas-y blue lighting in the bar area, the Northwest coffehouse style old-looking couch in the back, the Asian influence...Im not a proponent of ""matchy-matchy"" decor, but this was all over the place. Service was just okay, too. I wont be back any time soon."
1,"this another place that i would give no stars to if possible.  its been on the corner of mill and university for as long as i can remember, which is impressive since nothing older than ten years has been able to withstand the rent increases, and even more impressive because i dont know a single person who goes there. i went in there one time, for drinks and walked past one of the foulest salad bars Ive ever seen. for some reason, its right by the door. instead of walking in to see a hostess stand you walk right into this brown mess of vegetables. after seeing that first off, i wouldnt dream of ordering food here. the place is also dark and dirty and theres never anyone inside of it. seriously, Im really curious how this place survives. awesome little neighborhood wing and live music joints like long Wongs get torn down for high rise condos, yet gross, ghost town ruby Tuesdays hangs on the corner of main and main of Tempe. what is wrong with the world?"
3,"Since I work @ a casino, Im always checking out the others...Plus, I like to gamble!!  This place is nice, but seemed to be lacking personality. Its new, so its very clean, w/all new machines. The few employees I dealt with, seemed extremely bored, and a drink girl was nowhere to be found. Because this place is new, and @ the edge of the Phx. area, they dont have to try very hard, and I think it shows."
3,"This place was just okay.  While I cant claim to be an expert in Korean food, I am used to the Korean bbq restaurants in Los Angeles and I can say that this place cannot compete with those restaurants.   First, they didnt seem to have the proper ventilation for Korean BBQ.  I have never been to a place where you could see smoke throughout the restaurant from people cooking at their table.  Second, the service was AWFUL.  It took them forever to just greet us and bring us water and the fact that it was toooo HOT in there did not make us happy to wait 15 minutes for our water or for someone to even acknowledge our presence.   The food was decent but the seafood pancake was super disappointing.  They didnt even chop up the green onions that they put in it (seriously, like entire stalks of green onion) and it had no seasoning...  I may give this place another shot but as for now, Id give them 2.5 stars if I could."
4,"Super cool space, friendly host (owner?) making all feel welcome and at home. Went with a large group on a Saturday night prime dinner hour and it was a no hassle wait, perhaps due to the company, it was painless. The Four Peaks beer choices, games of skill and comfy waiting area eased it as well. Service was attentive as sometimes large parties are tough to handle, but I observed no glitch here.  I do plan to return when excessive day drinking has not blurred my perspective, but I remember having some pretty solid food. I sampled the Fontina cheese appetizer, perhaps my expectations were askew but I was surprised to see cheese sticks. I suppose I envisioned a wedge of cheese, either way it tasted fine and the pair of dipping sauces were unique. Sharing the same dish a savory romesco balanced with a sweeter pear sauce, I enjoyed them both with the cheese. Skirt steak is spiced nicely with garlic, chile and cumin ,charred and sliced, smothered with tasty mushrooms comforted by a hearty scoop of Yukon mashers. Not my optimum presentation as I like to cut it myself. I think the beef, which tasted great, went beyond the medium rare request which seemed to just be ignored. Not enough resting time from grilling to cutting and plating I would guess, however the meat was still juicy .I also had the chance to sample the maple glazed pork with pear crisps. Yum. Well cooked ,juicy and chock full of smoky sweet goodness. The side of Gorgonzola grits was a bit loose, but the flavor was very nice. Portions were very generous.  Looking forward to checking this spot out again without the world of beer fest goggles head start."
1,"Bad music, slow service, disgusting overpriced drinks, and annoying patrons.  Definitely wouldnt come back if someone paid me to. I cant even drink this margarita."
5,"Market Bistro never leaves me disappointed. The people are great. The food is ALWAYS good & it doesnt matter what you get, they will cater to your needs & wants. Definitely a must if your coming to Phoenix or if you live here, you need to try it."
5,"I recommend making OpenTable reservations, as this place is small.  I had a great dining experience and I enjoyed the drinks and food. Margaret (sp) was a great server. I like to dine at local places like this, particularly those that make their drink mixes in house and use locally sourced food [when possible]. The drinks I had were great: Aloe Arizona, The Kingston Rum Punch and Piña Colada Redux I had a dish with red snapper and vegetables; which was excellent. I had rice and peas on the side, the rice was not the best however; it seemed too dry. My friend had the prawns, I did not taste it, but the presentation looked good. She also had the coconut water which was served in a coconut - it was great and she mentioned it complimented the prawn dish. For desert I had a Créme Brûlée made with pineapple and rum."
4,"6 cities in 10 days.....no significant delays, great service and the food was even good. Get rid of the lowly 757s to Hawaii and give me the fancy LAX-JFK 777 for all 5 hour flights, plus redo the overhead compartments in the 767s and Ill give Delta 5 stars.  Great job with the merger as the employees/customers seem much, much happier!"
5,"Awesome resort.  I was able to stay there to celebrate a birthday in July, and fortunately it wasnt as hot as it usually is.  I am a wimp when it comes to heat, but the resort was wonderful, even with many things being closed.  The summer is off season for this spot.  We had a great time at the spa, and lying by the pool.  Be sure to have your food and drinks served there.  It feels so luxurious."
3,"Changs has a good menu but this location still needs to work on their service.  Each time I have been unimpressed by the consistency of service.  Also, when refilling water, please do not slosh it everywhere.  I know you are in a hurry, but points for style are awarded for not slopping water on the table, floor, and customers...(aka my guests).   Gets pretty noisy so I recommend getting there before the dinner crowd for a conversational meal."
5,"I know Kerrie through my networking and we benefit from her presence. I have not needed her services and most of us dont plan on needing an attorney. But I am always reminded by a tagline that Kerrie often mentions.  ""People in crisis need company, Droban & Company"".  How very true. When that time comes, and in these troubled days, it WILL. You will need good company. I would look for Kerrie to help and so should you."
5,"I had the Gnocchi in Shitake Dijon Cream Sauce, and it was unreal.  Cute little place.  I didnt sit to eat so I cant comment on the service, but they were extremely amicable when I ordered my take out."
5,"Along with pretty much everyone else who has left a review for this place, I LOVE THIS PLACE. I grew up in the area and one night my dad and brother wanted to check it out (my brother is a Yelp addict and saw it had amazing reviews). I was skeptical since, driving past, it is your typical ""hole in the wall"" kind of place, but I was not disappointed at ALL. The carne asada burrito is amazing, even the salad it comes with is great. I think my favorite thing aside from that would have to be the aguas frescas, particularly the orange one...SO good. You probably will not regret ordering a single thing from this menu. Ive gone back countless times, one time bringing one of my friends who was convinced that anywhere a blonde gringa tried to take her for Mexican food would be craptastic, but she loved it too."
4,"My roommate and I stopped by here  on a Saturday night with my groupon to see how this Fuego is holding up. Ive been to Fuego Bistro before, and it was amazing, so this one at CityScape had a lot to live up to. Id say this place gets less than 5 stars based on atmosphere. The place kind of feels like a cafeteria and the vibe from the entire patron situation is just bleh. The best part about the atmosphere was my own company and that of our server, Brandon, who was really helpful and chatty. Also, while my roommate got the Chile Relleno, which was okay in my opinion, I had the Fuego Tacos with pernil (which apparently is pork), and they were delicious. I absolutely loved and devoured them.  Some other key points: The drinks were very tasty and parking is very easy. We parked at a meter (which is free after 5p), and Im told they can validate the parking ticket for the underground parking. Overall, Id come back here. I wouldnt go here for a sexy date or if looking for something fancy, but definitely for a tasty dinner with great service."
4,"Quiessence is, simply put, beautiful.  Full windows and earthy wooden walls give a feeling of warmth inside this restaurant perched in the middle of a farm.  The restaurant seemed fairly full even on a Tuesday evening; we had secured reservations just a couple days before. My friend and I had sampled sandwiches at the Farm Kitchen earlier that week, and were impressed enough to want to eat at the restaurant.  The crisp, fresh veggies didnt disappoint: we ordered the salad with orange and grapefruit slices and the crudites to start.  Both were very good; I didnt even know how much I liked raw radishes and turnips until I tried them with their pesto and aioli sauces. For entrees, I ordered the lamb and my friend ordered the pork shoulder.  Service started out very good, but trailed off quickly.  Waiting for our food took a very long time (a couple seated after us received and finished their entrees before we received ours), and no one bothered to explain the situation until the maitred apologized almost 45 minutes later.  Apparently the chef was unhappy with the sauce on my entree, so he started anew.  This isnt really a problem, but they should have communicated this to us earlier.  For our troubles, they comped me the glass of wine I ordered, but they forgot to bring out with my entree  as I had requested.  Also, they didnt offer us bread, but I will echo the lady who whispered this to us on her way out: ask for the bread.  We received warm foccacia, apple walnut, and pomegranate slices of wonder with honey and butter.  YUM. The entrees were both solid, but didnt quite live up to the innovation and freshness of the vegetables.  My lambs sauce was delicious, but the meat was tough.  Maybe the vegetarian entrees are the way to go?  But our dessert, the gingerbread pear cake, was yet another winner. If the entrees were tad more inspired, or the service werent so spotty, this place definitely would have warranted five stars.  If I return, Id like to try the 75$ tasting menu.  Our bill came out to about 100$ for two people, including tip, no drinks."
4,"Went for my birthday and anniversary, and I was pleased by both the service and the food.  The waiter let me try a  piece of Prime Rib, since Id never had it before (I know, what have I been missing?!?!), so kudos for going out of his way. Another nice touch was the manager personally coming over to introduce herself and ask about our experience.  Overall the service was great, and the food, while tasty, wasnt spectacular or terribly distinguished.  I probably wouldnt come here too often, mainly due to price, unless I have more birthday coupons."
1,"Terrible rolls. The Dragon was so so. The California was bland and the Spicy Tuna was cat food. Seriously, it  looked like canned cat food and tasted horrible."
5,Fun little place to just explore and TRY so many different samplings.    The staff was great and super friendly!  The lemon cupcakes were AMAZING!!!   Little tip:  buy a baguette to try all the great olive oils and tapenades
2,"First off nothing gourmet going on here at all. Its basically Subway with free delivery and they have to deliver it for free or there is no way in hell you would bother with the place. Its cheap, generic, flavorless food."
4,"Take the whole family and get a nice table outside. The burgers are good, the fried zucchini is better and the the barbecue chicken is amazing..."
2,"Long ago, Salvation Army used to be the place to go when you thought of ""thrift stores"". Sadly, this place is WAY overpriced for being a thrift store. I have chatted with other random people who thought the same thing about this one - way too expensive!  :( I dont know who is pricing this stuff, but they are out of their mind, probably watching too much ""Storage/Auction Wars"" or ""Pawn Stars"" thinking that everything is worth a ton of money. Goodwill is just up the street on Grand and has better prices."
2,"I feel the Days Inn Tempe is best described as ""a place where you can purchase the right to sleep for awhile.""  I booked my 10-night stay on Travelocity for a non-smoking room, yet when I entered the room I almost choked. It was disgusting. Ive never had a smoking hotel room before and I will make sure I dont again. They said they couldnt move us to a different room. My local lady friend brought over a bottle of wine but forgot a corkscrew. No big deal, I thought to myself, as the front desk of a hotel will surely have a corkscrew. Nope. Coors Light it is. The towels felt like they were made of cow tongue, and they missed our wakeup call one morning making me late for a training class that had cost me about $500. Im awarding one star in addition to the minimum one-star rating because I got to drink cheap beer by the pool in 90 degree weather for 10 days, and there are a few good places to eat and two dollar stores very nearby. The dollar store had a corkscrew."
4,"Step back in time! Every once in awhile you start to look for something different for lunch and then pops up a place like MacAlpines. Besides the great 50s atmosphere and good food, this place will have you smiling and reminicing the moment you step into the door! I am not downtown that often but rest assured, I will be back to this place."
4,"Dropped in today for the first time...and can I say its worth the drive? No attitude. No c*nty saleswomen like that OTHER PLACE THAT SHALL NOT BE MENTIONED. Cashier, sales people and customers were all so darn friendly and helpful I dont know what to say other than...YAY! Ill drive the 20 miles here to get my dog the food he needs. Buh-bye local business pet store thats closer to me and sells the same brand of food I buy for my dog...Im a fan of the BEAST!"
3,"Mixed reviews from my husband and I: His comments:  * Salad was good - we had the spinach & Gorgonzola salad.  * Pizza was really good, but too expensive. Plus, it was the thinner type so you wouldnt expect to pay that much. * Wait staff - not good.  * Ambiance - pretty nice. Has a NY type of feeling. * Too pricey to go back My comments:  * Salad had too much dressing. It was dripping with the balsamic stuff. I dont like soppy lettuce. * Pizza was just ok. It was served to us fairly quickly considering that the place was packed. However, it was not hot. Plus, we had to wave our server down to ask her to heat it up. She didnt seem very happy with us and did not offer an apology for the cold pie. After all, this place is called Humble Pie.  * Wait staff - Not good. Not very forthcoming with the menu and only seemed to be interested in getting the ordering over with. * The staff should be humble enough to ask the customer if everything is ok after the food is served. That never happened. Even when she brought over the check we got nothing.  * Ambiance - too loud and dark! Tables and chairs are packed tight in this place so plan to share your space with others not in your party.  * Definitely not going back.  We paid $34 plus tip for a small Cesar salad, pizza with three toppings, soft drink and glass of wine. Too much money for some Sis food."
5,"I was visiting Tempe for Ironman Arizona and came down with pretty acute foot injury three days prior to the race.  The friendly receptionist at Dr. Natchers office understood the predicament I was in and managed to fit me into Dr. Natchers schedule within a couple hours of my call.  Dr. Natchers is clearly both a great doctor and a great person; she is extremely competent, friendly, and sympathetic.  As an  runner and cyclist, she is also in tune with sports injuries and the mentality of an athlete. She quickly diagnosed the injury and prescribed an aggressive treatment protocol.  I was in good shape on race day (due to her treatment protocol) and am so very thankful to Dr. Natcher for putting me in the position to complete the race in fine fashion.  I was paying out-of-pocket, and  was very pleasantly surprised by the cost of the office visit.  I cant speak highly enough of my experience with Dr. Natcher."
4,"The employees at this location are sooo nice! Even when its super busy they are still very friendly. My favorite thing about this place is its open 24 hours! If you want breakfast for dinner or a milkshake at midnight you can have it! My fiancee enjoys their french dip sandwich whereas I always try something different. I just had dental work and have been eating like a senior citizen, so I opted for the mac n cheese. It was warm and gooey with a crunchy cheese topping- a great comfort food. Late at night this place is especially fun because of the people watching."
2,"This is tough, because I REALLY wanted to like this place! What killed it for me? The lack of professionalism that was presented when my fiance and I came to look at this venue. I will admit that we were 10 minutes late to our appointment, however I do not think this warrants being treated like a herd of cattle. First when I called the venue to make an appointment whoever picked up the line sounded as if they were in a rush and not even interested in making the appointment which was the first turn off. Upon arrival, we walked into another entrance thinking it was the main entrance, then we were re-directed by an employee to the adjacent door. As we walked out there was (I dont even remember her name), the wedding coordinator waiting. She quickly greeted us then had us sit down as she began to talk about the venue.  Usually when you want to sell the venue you run, youd think you would see someone with a little enthusiasm and fire explaining why their venue is so amazing. Well, we didnt get that from this individual. What did we get? A quick 10 minute spiel about what they do and the services provided and 3 wedding books shoved in our faces as examples then a quick 10 minute tour of the place. Thats it, no effort, no emotion, no interest in wanting to get to know us and get a feel for what kind of wedding we would like to have, just a quick, here is the place, goodbye. She was very snooty and acted as if she was not in the mood to showcase the venue. So why two stars instead of zero? One star is for the venue itself. It is very chic, modern, yet elegant. The reception area is beautifully decorated and where the ceremony is held is beautiful as well! There are many ways one can decorate this place! The other star is the PRICE. This venue offers all inclusive packages at unbeatable prices. I mean an all inclusive package where they provide virtually everything for roughly 100 guests is $9495.00 taxes and gratuity included!!! Thats a steal, trust me, Ive looked into a TON of venues, you will not find an all inclusive price as cheap as this.  Honestly, if my fiance and I were the only individuals funding our wedding, then we probably would have considered this place (more than likely, VEGAS). However, given the type of customer service that was displayed, we took our business elsewhere."
3,"This seems like a decent place to get a drink, if youre so inclined, before going thru security.  The service was so so, but I also think our waiter was in training. We didnt venture very far into the actual restaurant, just sat at one of the pub tables by the enterance to keep an eye on the security line, so I guess its good for that as well."
5,Excellent food! Agree the sizzling rice soup is a must try. I had chicken pad thai 5 of 7 spicy level because I like spicy food. Great you can request spiciness level on each entree.
5,"I am not one to hang out in Downtown Phoenix before or after an event because quite frankly its boring.  However, when I visited Copper Blues on 2/4/12 prior to the comedy show next door I will definitely be hanging out after events. Heres Why ... They have a live band and over sixty beers on tap.  Its a nice cozy environment especially if you sit outside.  Budweiser drafts were only $5 and soda was only $3.  We didnt try their food but I hear the same owner owns both Copper and Stand Up Live so I am sure the kitchen is the same so I am confident in saying that the food is delicious because it was at Stand Up Live. Happy hour is 4PM to 7PM Sun-Thurs so its basically perfect when any event is taking place during on those days. On this Satuday night people were having a good time.  The draft beer was perfect and fresh.  The music was good and the bartender was real friendly and answered all of our questions cheerfully. We had such a great time that me and my wife are going back to Copper Blues on 2/23/12 to hang out and drink with friends prior to our comedy show next door. This is a nice spot and you have to check it out especially if you are going to the show next door !"
4,"We stopped in for a snack between lunch and dinner and luckily caught some great HH specials!    The restaurant was virtually empty on a Friday around 3pm, but I didnt mind much as we were in a hurry.  We sat at the sushi bar and enjoyed the company of the chef.   The service was a little bit rock to start off as I think 3 different people tried to take our order, but once it got rolling- we were good to go.  I had some Sea Bass Nigiri ($3 for 2 pieces), Spicy Tuna Roll ($3-4), Edamame ($1.50), and a wonderful house salad topped with sliced pears and a delicious house dressing ($3).  The fish was all very fresh and clean tasting, but the salad was honestly my favorite!"
3,"Hot Bagels. To a random passerby, its like any bagel place really. To locals and Midwestern students, its a holy temple. And to me, well its a highly overrated bagel place. But hey, its still delicious! Especially if youre in the mood for a bagel. But its kinda pricey. I ultimately paid like $8 for a bagel with lox, cream cheese, and a bag of chips. Seriously?? I mean, yes, it was one of the best bagels Ive ever had but I couldve gone next door to Senor Taco and gotten a burrito for $3 less and have enough for a dry-cleaning job at the $2.25 cleaners adjacent! And thats what brings this place down. While bagels are delicious and its hard to mess up bagels, its still just a bagel. So if youre feeling like having a bagel, definitely check this place out. Its on par with or better than Einstein Bros. Just dont be overhyped by all the love the locals have for this place because in the end, youre just having a bagel. =)"
3,"Id read about this place before (on blogs written by people from Utah) so when I was driving down Baseline and hungry and saw it I decided to try it out. It is set up a lot like Chipotle, however the process of ordering is somehow not quite as clear. Additionally I wasnt sure what went with my meal and what cost extra. That aside the salmon tacos I got were really tasty. I dont think Ive had salmon as the fish in fish tacos at a restaurant before and I enjoyed the change. The price seemed a little high, but not so high that I wont visit again if Im in Gilbert and looking for a quick meal."
5,"Big fan of this store - the owner tries very hard to create an inviting atmosphere for all levels of gamers. Further, the store provides for a host of niches, including euro-games, Ameritrash, role playing, and miniature wargaming. Good amount of supplies (both GW and P3, among others). Lots of tables for miniature gaming, board games, CCGs, and painting in the back (and a fridge with soda). Theyve started carrying MTG over the last few months, and that collection has grown. Always something going on here, but nothing intimidating.  The owner is very, very helpful: willing to answer questions about painting, games, and to make special orders (even trips over to Gilbert at Battlefoam when necessary). Yep, big fan."
2,This pizza always tasted great but lately I feel like they have cheapened their ingredients. I realize its $5 pizza but it just tastes different to me now. If it werent for the flavored crust I would not come back.  But the main reason I have not returned to Hungry Howies is because the last time I wanted to place a pick up order I was turned down. I asked for a reason and was told that they received a very large company order and they were not taking regular orders at that moment.  Youd think they would be able to accommodate everyone even if a large order was placed.
2,The price is a little high for me.  They dont give enough bean sprouts without asking for more.  The pho broth is a little too sweet for me also
5,"Great place, enjoyed the amenities. Pool was great and view on the property was very picturesque. Food in the property restaurants were very good. Definitely would stay there again if ever in Scottsdale again."
5,"Great little restaurant.  The staff is super friendly, and their happy hour specials are pretty amazing.  I got thePanko crusted Tipalia which was a little dry, but my girlfriends stuffed mahi mahi was delicious.  The Horchata bread pudding was really good too.  They have a nice patio where most of the customers sit, I will be bringing my dog with me next time.   It is a bit expensive, so be prepared to drop some money, but its definitely worth checking out."
1,Nasty workers and over priced trash
4,"This is my go-to pizza joint. Ive been here numerous times and the pizza is always delicious. My favorite is the Barros Special (Pepperoni, ham, onions, green pepper and mushrooms). Its a nice thick and hearty style pizza with a great tasting crust. They have a play area with a little kitchen, legos and TV playing Nickelodean for the kids which is great. They also have ESPN on so I can chill and watch some sports while the kids play."
4,"This restaurant = a great experience. Everything about this place is fabulous. The server was extremely attentive, the food was fresh and delicious, and the intimate yet casual ambiance is to die for. ENTREE For starters, they do put a rather unique spin on the typical chips and salsa thats brought out to you in the beginning of most Spanish restaurants. They bake corn tortillas until their crisp and serve that with an interesting array of dips: black bean, salsa, and a tray of salt, limes, and hot sauce to stir in. I ordered a simple entree of carne asada tacos and black beans; my meal was yummy and filling, and I even had leftovers. Beware of spicy when choosing your dish, however. My coworker kept complaining about how hot her meal was (beer battered fish burrito). I dont know if she has sensitive taste buds, or if it was really spicy.. so proceed with caution. DESSERT They have a wide variety of entrees, but unfortunately only have 3 sweet options. Im a BIG dessert person, so it was a little disappointing but what the heck. I ordered the flan and it was scrumptious, incredible, delectable, etc.. all that good stuff. My coworker who complained about the spiciness called our dessert sexy. So I guess sexy is the best way to describe its caramel drizzle and chocolate bark yumminess. AMBIANCE/SERVICE The waiter was incredibly attentive and friendly. He answered all questions we had, and gave speedy and praiseworthy service. The manager even came up to our table and made conversation; that, to me, is always a plus. The background music helped add to the overall appeal to the restaurant.  I would definitely go back to SOL. Maybe tomorrow.."
4,I had a serious craving for Roti.  So glad I found this place.  A very small menu selection but it had exactly what I wanted.  The serving for $8.20 after tax is enough for 2 meals.  I know where to go from now on for a great meal with leftovers.  This is a noteworthy place to bring my Uncle T.J. whos a Trini when he comes to visit.
5,"Ive often driven by here, & figured Id go in & take a look sometime.  But I was looking for a clock-mini-speaker system that I use with my iPhone 4.   When I had my 3G, I had a very bad experience where I was assured that a particular clock-mini-speakers I bought would work with it - but all it had was a cheap plastic adapter that the 3G kept falling out of - & then they gave me a hard time about a refund. This time, I was again getting either glib reassurances & non-specific information, ""sorry out of stock""s, or  NO OPEN floor samples I could look at, at 3 other stores (including the big A Store with a lot of Jobs), not to mention conflicting info on Amazon & upon Googling.   So I thought to go into the iStore. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised! They had open, plugged in items that I could actually test my iPhone 4 in to make sure it worked. Even better, I began chatting with the guys there about various other iPhone &  MacBook Pro issues, & found they had FAR more knowledge about BOTH the phone & its peripherals and MacBook Pros (and HONESTY about them) than I ever got from the ""really-really-smart"" folks at the Big-A-Store-with-Jobs who will promise you anything.  So, I would definitely go back there for honest advice & I would certainly bring in anything that needed warranty service.  They also have a pretty nice selection of peripherals and better yet, they know WHAT WORKS WITH WHAT!"
4,"oooooooooh man am I SO GLAD this place isnt near my house, I would gain 20 pounds in no time!  My sister took me here for the first time a couple weeks ago and my mind was blown by all the unique flavors they served!  The shop itself is very cute and modern. I like that they have a section in the back with a bunch of board games, very cool.  As for the ice cream I got the dutch chocolate and the horchata. The horchata was so so good, I cant stop thinking about it!  The following week I took the husband there. Again the ice cream was very good but the service was terrible. It was an older lady behind the counter and she really couldnt care less that we were standing there. She let me sample an ice cream and then I just stood there for a good 5 minutes while she did other things behind the counter. We did finally get served but my husband wasnt impressed with the serves one bit. This time I got my ice cream in a waffle cone, the cone was so light and airy, I loved it!"
1,"It saddens me to say that this isnt the worst Mexican restaurant weve eaten at, thats on Oahu near Waikiki beach, but its close.   Damn it we had to drive by Arribas to get to this place.    I had a chimichanga that was a little anemic, though what there was of the filling was ok,  beans  tasteless, rice looked the part but as spicy as your average UK meal involving boiled meat and root vegetables.  Erins Fajita salad was similarly lack luster  with  all the appearance of being tasty yet   bland chicken. Usually, unless theres an attempt at ""chefing"" as opposed to cooking  Ill order a basic dish ( I dont shoot the chef though  and trust me these guys are safe from Agent Sands , very safe)  for the first time out  and if the beans/rice suck.. no return. Overall It feels like aliens, space ones, are running the place and they learned cooking from pictures.  Its certainly a mistake we wont be repeating."
4,"I am a harsh critic when it comes to Mexican Food.  My good buddy Paul talked me into coming to this place.  When I asked him what to expect, he was correct in saying: ""Dont worry dude, just get the green on green with a taco on the side and watch the hood life unfold.""  He was CORRECT!  This place is in the hood and they open at 10:30am for lunch.  The lines get long at about 11am.  They have a video game from the 80s while you wait. They serve drinks in THE CAN so I would suggest getting a 32oz thirstbuster beforehand.  If you go in the summer, you will be HOT in the summer heat as the only place to sit are at the picnic tables located OUTSIDE of course.  If you try to alter your order, you will be SCOWLED AT by the cashier.  However, if you treat her with respect, she will say something in spanish to the old heavy hispanic lady in the kitchen who stirs the chili and the fat lady will either NOD or shake her head.  All in all - a great place to eat!!"
5,"I have long liked Tempe Maretplace since it has opened.                                                 It is a good location, lots of parking all around. Since when live in the extreme heat it is a bit nice that it is outdoors.              There is a major selection or stores ,restaurants and services here.  My girlfriend likes it as well. So it is a win win set up. They are decorated really well and they have a multitude of events here. Even a Barnes and Noble,which bookstores are not that easy to come accross now days."
5,"Great food and service. Normally a wait on the weekend, but what would you expect."
4,"Went there with the Wife. Lots of stuff for the ladies. I would lay off making any real purchase here on my own, I would of course consult the Mrs. In regards to what she might like. Way to tough to try and pick something out in here (Louis Vuitton, Gucci, etc.) that is the stuff for the ladies to decide on. Nice place, very friendly staff, warm, and inviting one to buy."
4,"Got there at 11am on a Sunday, it was packed to the gills. WOW! I should have listened to Michele M. We ordered shrimp dumplings, roasted pork, bbq steamed buns, turnip cakes, shrimp egg rolls, chicken feet, spare ribs, steam sticky rice with meats, fried tofu, egg tarts, etc... Everything was good. This is the best dim sum you can get in Phoenix."
2,"I wasnt really very impressed. Bajio isnt *bad* by any stretch, but its certainly nothing to really rave about. The prices were a little steep for what you get and everything (keep in mind, this is mexican food) was oddly sweet for some reason...and that struck me oddly.  Burritos and such, served in a very Chipotle-esque fashion, but for a few bucks more than Chipotle.  I dont believe Ill be returning. Not because it was a negative experience, just exceptionally ""meh""."
2,"To even admit to serving tex-mex is the first clue about how bad the food is there.  And whoever that nit wit was that said Arizona has bad Mexican obviously knows nothing about Good Mex food.  Ill admit right from the start that I dont want authentic Mex. food.  Go on down to Nogales and get some authentic Mex. food Ha!  What I want is authentic valley of the sun sonoran style Mex. food the way its evolved for a hundred years from the early Mexican Legal Immigrants.  Ihave been all over the USA and true you can get some decent mex food in cal, new mex., west texas.  But to get the best Beans, enchiladas, red, green, chile, tamales tortillas you have to get it right here in AZ.  Here are a few great places.  Don Joses, Matador, Carolinas. Manuels, Some Burro, Juans, Ajo Als, Macayos.  The two best are Ricardos and Papagayos, oops,  They closed because the new management wrecked the food and drove away the faithful.  And thats THE TRUTH, from ""The Truth"" Ciau!"
4,Chambord margaritas are killer!
5,I have been going to Salon Mila for 12 years.  I will never go anywhere else.  My hair always looks amazing when I leave.  The color and cut are always perfect!  I feel glamorous and beautiful when I leave.  First class salon!  Beautiful surroundings!  Always great service!  They aim to please!  Mila knows what it takes to make sure her customers feel welcome all the time!  Thanks everyone!
5,"If you want a good meal that will fill ya up, for a fair price...Wallys is a great choice! The menu has great variety.  If you want a burger, there are many to choose from.  Each is huge and juicy, and comes with your choice of a side....go with the blended fries that include deliciious sweet potato fries. Want a salad?  Again, many to choose from...my favorite is the chinese chicken.  And, in case you missed my earlier comments, expect a BIG salad. And, if youre not watching your calories, then try any of their specialty macncheese dishes.  WOW! I cant comment on the desserts because I cant eat anything beyond the entrees...but, Ive seen others order a dessert; they looked yummy and - you guessed it - HUGE! And, heres the thing about Wallys:  theyre ""good people"".  in addition to providing you with a great meal, Wallys staff are active supporters of non-profit organizations in the greater Phoenix area.  I have first-hand knowledge of their support for the Valley of the Sun Unted Way, and the Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Scottsdale.  I have no doubt they support other causes."
5,"I have used Todd on at least a dozen occasions. I am a property investor and I buy multiple homes. I need Todd for EVERY house I do and he is ALWAYS there for me. He even got me into my own car once. At the drop of a hat, he is there for me. His knowledge is excellent, his demeanor is fantastic and his service and workmanship is excellent. I would NEVER use another locksmith unless he was dead or out of town. In which case I would probably ask him to come home. :) Use this guy. Hes great."
4,"Was there last night and had a good time.  I learned several things:  1.  Charlies has a cover charge of $3 if you get there after a certain time, I believe this starts at midnight or 1 am.  I got there after 1 am and the place was packed, absolutely packed.   2.  Yes, in Phoenix, some bars can stay open until 4 am (gasp!).  Yes, I know, it blew me away as well.   3.  The little Mexican food place attached to Charlies serves really good food late night, but now I understand why they cant sell water or soda through the inside window to Charlies customers.  Thats because Charlies wants to charge patrons $2.50 for a bottle of water than the Mexican restaurant sells for $1 outside.   Other than that, I had a good time."
3,"Decades ago when this festival was up and coming, and I lived in Tempe, I would go to this street fair as we called it then two or three times while it was going on. Today I went with a friend. The festival has grown by blocks now. Its pretty big, I think they claim 400 vendors! That has to include the food vendors.  I had my fry bread taco. It was super good and $9 bucks. I looked for something to buy but left with nothing. The things I liked most were huge home items and big ticket prices. I saw a few handbags of interest but not within my budget either. It use to be that this festival would have jewelry, matted photography and pottery a college student could afford. Thats still my budget this year, unfortunately - but such priced things could not be located here this year. So Im disappointed with the festival offerings.  Parking covered & uncovered was $10 if you could not find free street parking. There wasnt enough ice cream vendors in my opinion but there was plenty of food vendors and the neighboring eateries were also busy and offering variety.  The entertainment was very limited. I hope they will seek more entertainment in the future especially since they claim its one of the top 20 street festivals in the country.  Otherwise there isnt much to stick around for unless you have deep pockets or want creative ideas."
4,"Excellent doppio and drip coffee this morning at Press Coffee, though the naughty side of me wanted a pint of Tripel Karmeliet, Lindemans Framboise Lambic, New Belgium Mothership Witbier, or Great Divide Pale Ale.  Cafe light breakfasts were served to some patrons, and most observations I had were of little English muffin egg sandwiches with assorted toppings inside. Coffee is the main focus here, at least by decor and by what most people were drinking this morning, and you cant resist noticing the craft beer taps as you enter the place.   Not terribly busy as this place hasnt fully been discovered, or really becacuse this area isnt fully developed yet.  Enjoy it while you can."
5,I really like this place alot. their pizzas are really different but really good! I wish i could say i had a favorite but ive liked every pizza ive gotten except the portabello mushrooms cause i dont like mushrooms but other than that they have an amazing beer selection! Major thumbs up!!
4,"yo, bro, lets compare forearm tats and drink some New Castle. P.S. everyone saw you bif it on your fixie as you rolled up to the bike racks. for real, most predictable crowd ever!!!! I can talk mad shit on this place all night long, but when it comes down to it, I love it. The location lends to its patrons- alternative college students living in the only historic (PHX like) neighborhood in Tempe. Plus it is right next to HTC, so everyone is sure to be rocking the flyest of  -50 gauges. puke. but.......the charm of caseys is in the cats. they are cool and roam around. Also, the best patio ever, and lots of room. Dont go inside unless you cant get a drink b/ your waitress forgot about you (which is most likely what happened). Or if you like old dudes 65+ eyefucking the shit outta you be my guest. Also, one night after I was there, the next morning someone had charged $2000+ on my credit card for an ad in New Times. shady......or recession? I think I know how this happened, they leave your card within an arms reach from the bar inside, face-up so any creeper with 20/20 can get a peek and thief you out of your identity and money, or maybe it was an inside job??? but I really like this place and still have ""caseys nights"" even though jimmy eat world sucks and I live in phoenix.  oh yeah, this place is haunted too....and if you are a girl do not go pee in the grotto.gross."
5,Everything you need to feel like you opened a time capsule!  Place makes me want to have 5 houses to slather in vintage odds and ends.  The place is very well organized and themed which makes it easy to find items while youre on the hunt.
4,Best seafood place I have found in the Phoenix area. Everything from the crap dip to the crab legs and oysters is delicious. They have a wonderful fish selection as well and even their steaks are good. Service has always been excellent every time I have gone. Can get very busy on nights so try and go early if you can.
2,"As a breakfast snob I really do not like Dennys.  They dont really do anything especially well.  Also, Ive had inconsistent quality of food and helpfulness of staff on different occasions.  I cant slam this place for one unpleasant waitress, but I can for those inconsistencies and that fact that there are just so many other places that do what they do better. In fact, this place was the very last Dennys I ever ate.  The food took forever, it wasnt well done, came out all screwed up, and the waitress was unpleasant.  After that experience I decided to never set foot in another Dennys."
4,"A very tasty place for breakfast.  I strenuously object to any place that doesnt serve hash browns, but really thats my only complaint.  They have a ton of different omelets/scrambles (you choose) and you can make your own.  Example: spinach tomato sausage bacon with american cheese.  As a scramble.  With salsa.  The coffee is good (I hear from my wife) and the cinnamon roll is a real treat.  Not the best cinnamon roll ever in a million years but a good 8.5/10.   It is true that there can be a very long wait so plan ahead for sure.  Youll be waiting outside.   They grill their wheat toast-solid."
3,"This is a nothing but pies place...so I was expecting a little bit more oomph... Dispointing small selection of pie by the slices...also you gotta put in special order ahead of time for the more interesting stuff like Italian Ricotta.   I was going to order something with berries, but the stuff I saw in the case was just runny and wet looking...so I ended up with a black-bottom pie...I really liked the flaky crust and the filling wasnt bad except for the fact that it did taste a bit over refrigerated.   A minor gripe is the airpot coffee...not freshly brewed...despite the espresso machine clearly visibile behind the counter. The pies are just over $4 per slice and ~$20 per pie."
4,"I still have no idea what this place is.  I only know that my dog needed some pills to treat his valley fever and for some reason the vet didnt carry them so I was sent here. The whole process is pretty painless and I think their drugs are priced reasonably.  They will also hand deliver the medication the same day if you ask nicely. Pro Tip:  When you call, dont hang up right away when you get the recorded message.  When you stay on the line it will begin to ring again and someone may answer.  I thought the recorded message was an answering machine and hung up prematurely a few times.  Also, sometimes the line just rings and rings and rings.  Be patient and someone will probably pick up."
5,"A friend of a friend was telling us about this place on Sunday morning, and how awesome their pizza is.  It sounded awesome, but he warned us the line is usually an hour and a half long.  Oh well, we went anyway.  Luckily, we were early enough where we didnt have to wait long for a table.  When we were leaving, though, the line was easily an hour long. We started with the wings, which come in an order of 14 and were delicious.  Five of us were dining there, so we ordered two small pizzas, with each one being a half, so we had a nice variety of pizzas to try from.  We got the BBQ Chicken, the Frisco, Grandma Gs, and one more that eludes me now.  All were pretty delicious, and I give them mad props for going out of their way to create unique pizzas with untraditional toppings (Grandma Gs had potato on it).  Our entire bill with a few drinks came to under $80. Oh, make sure you sit outside... the inside had a lot of loud kids, and it seemed to echo off each wall and annoy the hell out of our party.  The women in our party also said the air temperature kept changing in there.  Keep in mind, too, that they dont have a full bar, so if youre going there hoping to start off with a bloody mary, youre out of luck."
1,"The food was not particularly good on our last visit there and the service was rude and not helpful at all.  I even emailed them afterwards to give feedback, in hopes that they would redeem themselves by showing some good service that way.  No luck.  Didnt even get a response. They will not be getting any more of my business.  Too bad because Id actually had a decent mushroom burger there before and would have been a regular customer.  But the service last time was so bad that I wont go back."
5,Best sushi in town.
2,"This particular restaurant is not set up well.  There is a section of 4 soups all clearly labeled, but further down, there is a black kettle of another soup with a tiny little label that you have to pick up and read. In the center of the counter, there is a bread bin, you have to lift the plastic door and hold it open while you retrieve your bread.  I was fascinated to watch other peoples techniques for bread retrieval while I was eating.  There are tortilla chips in this bin and then you have to go to one end of the counter for taco meat, then to the other end for cheese, lettuce, sour cream, etc. Poorly planned and smaller selection than Sweet Tomatoes, I would rather pay a few more dollars for a better selection."
5,"I have tried finding a spin class in Arizona that is of the intensity and variety that this studio offers.  Bar none.  The CoreBalance Studio has dedicated instructors that push you to your limit in an encouraging way.  The unique thing about this studio is they use the ""RealRider"" (or is it ""RealRyder""?) bikes that cause you to turn right and left to work your obliques. Outstanding workout! I recommend it to everyone who wants to get into shape."
4,"double-double, protein style, with pickles and spread only please. and a medium iced tea. in-n-out gets it. i like my burger the way i like it, and they dont mind serving it my way. they have never screwed up my order. they have the best iced tea, and fresh lemon wedges that arent pathetically small. they pay their workers a fair wage, and you can tell - theyre all nice and happy. love me some yummy, cheap eats and service with a smile!"
4,"Excellent service.  Easy to access.  Dessert is amazing.  Husband loved Salted Butter gelato, I loved the cherry.  he always loves his fish entrees here.  I eat very unsophisticated so finding anything here on the menu is hard for me.  I tried a pasta last night, it was salty and boring.   I still recommend this place for people with grown up tastes."
5,"great pho , boba :) and vermicelli .. awesome !"
5,"Amazing. Just stopped for snacks, had the fake crab rangoons and samosas. Very good. Will mos def come back to dine, hopefully several times, when in town.  Love that they sell Diaya in the cooler and other lovely products, books and junk foods!"
5,Good food
1,"While the menu looked promising, have no idea if the food is any good since the hostess failed to even acknowledge our presence when we walked in the door.   We patiently stood there for several minutes while she walked around us to greet and seat two other parties.   Since we were still unable to get her attention,  we left and went to Tommy Bahama across the street."
1,"Wow! I cant believe this place gets so many good reviews.  I was hauled here once by co-workers looking for a cheap meal. But, how much value does your lunch dollar have when you dont even want to eat the food? Dry and sticky rice; ""white meat chicken"" unidientifiable as such, and a sweet glaze that provided the only flavor. Quite frankly, it was disgusting, and none of the dishes my co-workers had looked any better (though they seemed to be fine with them). I should know to stay away from restaurants that have pictures of their menu items on the wall. The one star is only for the fast and friendly service."
4,"I really wanted to give this place 5 stars but.. well.. let me explain.  I came in on a Friday around 5:15pm trying to catch an early dinner. I am glad I did as upon entering I noticed they close close @ 7:30pm. When I came in all the tables were empty but they all had ""reserved"" place cards on them. Later I realized that there was some sort of club or church organization that came in and took over the restaurant so I would recommend making a reservation. The owner was very nice and sat us at one of the reserved tables. Her husband the chief quickly realized we knew nothing about polish food and offered us a sample of dill sour pickle soup. yummmmmy.  The restaurant itself is located in old town Glendales Catlin court in a small quaint little house that gives you a more personal ambiance. The owners made us feel like we were literally dinner guest at their house which was not what I was expecting but a nice surprise.  The food is best described as ""home cooking"". The soup was excellent and my favorite part of the meal but the rest tasted just as my parents would have made growing up at home and Im not Polish. Put simply all the main ingredients of my dish tasted as though they could have been bought at Frys and my mom cooked them. The kielbasa was good but nothing unique, sauerkraut was tasty, but the green beans were either overcooked, thawed from frozen, or from a can. I am by no means a Polish food expert and maybe this is exactly how they would make it in Poland?  Overall if you dont feel like cooking, want to try something new, and are in the mood for Polish food I would try it out and see for yourself. As for me I did like the restaurant and their owners but I think I will only return for the soup in the future, which I would gladly give 5 stars."
5,John did a fantastic job on figuring out my overheating issue on my Infiniti after Grelichs failed to fix my car properly. John is more than fair with there pricing and are extremely knowledgeable. He has a customer for life from me.
2,"After having been here a few times, I would say most of the reviews were dead on. The waiter was a fill in from another of the chain restaurants. The poor guy was serving everyone (which wasnt that busy) running around cool headed, apologetic and super fast paced.   After ""gonging"" our announcement that we were there, a guy came to seat us about 10 or so minutes later. Sadly, we were told that he was the owner... Not too personable.  To be fair, they really never had great service in the few times I have been there. What keeps me infrequently coming back is their drunken noodles. They rock. We went also for the referral of the pumpkin curry entree. Both more than made up for the extremely slow service and normally unfriendly staff. Summary of the rest of the reviews... Fish tank and others looked really clean, though I have seen them horrible before. Bathroom was atrocious... Filthy and gross. Waiter gave me some napkins and sent a guy out to buy more . Walk to the bathroom was down a dark hallway, thankfully again the waiter helped out with that... Poor guy! He deserves to manage the place and a raise! Lol"
4,"Does anyone else think chips and salsa are part of the foodgroups? I do! Yes this is a hole in the wall, yes it is in a scetchyer ""hood""  but it will be worth your time.  Margaritas...check out their 2.99 deals or just for the heck of it get a piture and share with some friends.  The atmosphere can be loud (decor and patrons alike), but for this reason, it is a good place to bring kids because no one cares when your kids are as loud as your adults. On to the food....Chimis are great, my husband always gets the heart attack style (this is not the name) chimi with white cheese sauce. There are a lot of vegitarian options here for all you non carnivores. If you are looking for good mexican food and mostly chips and salsa that should be part of the food pyramid, then Via Delosantos is your place."
2,"Disappointed.  Im from Jersey, everybody in my family raves about Jersey Mikes and they are all in Jersey.  First off,  I ordered the Italian sub that comes with the works (5 different meats) and is supposed to come with provolone.  Got home to Buckeye to learn there was no provolone on my sandwich.  That throws the taste of an Italian sub off, period.  My second disappointment was the meat.  The franchise contracts out to a provisioner to make all their cold cuts under the Jersey Mikes label, but the meat does not have the flavor of New Jerseys finest deli meats, Thumanns. Boars Head doesnt come in close to Thumanns but Ill take Boars Head when nothing else is available. Third place goes to Dietz and Watson.  If Peter Cancro, the CEO of Mikes really cares, hell get his meat elsewhere.  The staff was very friendly, the restaurant was clean, there were blown up photos of the Pt. Pleasant side of the Manasquan Inlet and Jenks pier with surfers heading out, a nice touch of back home, but thats the best I can say.  The staff was so personable I dont regret leaving them a tip even though they forgot my cheese.  I just wish I had a good reason to go back and see them again."
5,"I went to Tommy Vs for dinner last night with my husband and several of his clients...WOW!  This is my new favorite restaurant in town!  They have a private dining area that they can close off with curtains and turn the music off, which is perfect for a business dinner.  I am vegan, one of his clients is doing the paleo diet, and another is gluten free, and they had DELICIOUS options for all of us, while also serving AMAZING pasta and fish dishes to others at the table.  I cant recommend this restaurant enough.  I am just sorry I havent discovered it earlier.  YUM! YUM! YUM!  P.S.  Very cool atmosphere, too!"
4,Have been to Pita Jungle twice before. Feel the wait staff do a good job. Always friendly and good service. Best hummus in town. For s dollar more get the bigger plate of hummus but ask for extra pitas (39 cents each) and some extra cucumbers and tomatoes (99 cents). Not a fancy place but certainly someplace you want to try out.
4,"Great place for lunch, transport yourself back in time to this quaint farm grill which offers high quality food, fresh ingredients, killer burgers and an atmosphere that is one of a kind.  Good place for breakfast as well.  Family owned restaurant goodness.  Only drawback is the line, however good things come to those who wait."
5,"The place did not disappoint. The moment we stepped through the archway, my friends and I were bedazzled by the ambience throughout the area.  It really DOES feel like a tavern, almost like something out of Pirates of the Caribbean (Well.. kind of) But yeah, the portions were overwhelming, and best of all? The food was spectacular. I sat outside, but honestly? I think the place is pretty both ways, so dont be too stingy on the location :) Jus go."
5,"My first box of NGD arrived a few weeks and tears nearly came to my eyes as I removed the produce from the box.  I havent seen such beautiful, fresh, well packaged produce since I was a kid (and Im no spring chicken).  The carrots tasted like the sweet carrots I remember and the lettuce (with the dirt from the farm still fresh on the leaves) so full of flavor.  The amazing thing is that I had come to expect most organic vegetables and fruits to be less visually appealing than the chemical type but such is not the case with NGD. The medium size box has been perfect for our little family of four.  It is delivered on our day like clockwork around 2am.  The unseen elf that drops off the goodies is nice enough to open the carton and place all the contents in our cooler so everything stays nice in this boiling cauldron we call Phoenix.  Furthermore, I live way out in Carefree/Cave Creek where we always expect to be on the list of places too far away for delivery.  Not with NGD.  It appears from the labeling they have optimized their routes so they can include many outlying areas.  Finally, there is a gentleman named Ben that works for NGD.  He has been very helpful in making sure everything is going smoothly and that we are using the service properly. We think NGD is a great value for organic produce delivered to your door and HIGHLY recommend NGD!"
4,"ROCK OUT WITH YOUR COCK OUT!!! As a big heavy metal and hard rock fan I just had to make sure to hit up Alice Cooperstown on my recent visit to Phoenix. As I walked into this warehouse sized rock & sports mecca I was surely not disappointed. This place is huge. There is an outdoor beer garden seating area on the side of the building and when you walk indoors you realize that this place is airplane hanger big. Rock and roll memorabilia is plastered everywhere here with a terriic amount of Alice Cooper posters, gold and platinum records, photos, paintings, guitars, and other stuff representing his Hall of Fame career plastered throughout. Even all the tables are covered in rock photos and images. Along side all of that is a mix of sports memorabilia spread throughout with flat screen tvs and large projection screens everywhere! Yeah, as you can imagine, they play some great rock music here, classic to current. This is the type of place that Hard Rock Cafe wishes it could be. The menu here is pretty big with a mix of classic bar food, comfort food, and BBQ. Nice selection of beers on tap and in bottles. We ordered a mixed BBQ platter and it was actually some pretty decent BBQ! Great ribs and tasty brisket. Alas, what caught my eye was The Big Unit. Not just a regular hot dog, but 22 inches of Vienna Beef destruction loaded with chili, onions, jalapenos, sauerkraut, relish, tomatoes, cheese sauce, shredded cheddar, and bacon, along with a bunch of crispy fries. Oh Yeah! This is the dog that Adam Richman devoured on Man vs Food! They ring a big bell whenever this is ordered. I saw a few people give up on it and take half home in a box. Not me. Now I was going to join that fat ass and do some damage here myself! Yup, I ate that whole damn thing! Honesty, it was pretty tasty and was not too hard to finish. Just had to pace myself. Drinking a huge cup of diet Coke while doing this was not too smart as my gut felt like it was going to explode! Still, I got the whole thing down my throat bit by bit and swallowed it whole. Heh-heh-heh! I sat there in euphoric bliss of my accomplishment. Boy, did I feel like a fat slob. On the way out we had to look around the souvenier area and picked up a few things. Had a great time here and the food was pretty good. Nice waitress and all of them here wear Alice Cooper-like eye makeup while working which adds to the fun. Menu items are fairly priced too. This part of town is empty unless a game is going on and there is a parking garage across the street, along with metered spots on the streets but after 8PM they are free. Lots of available parking. MAN vs FOOD AINT GOT NOTHING ON ME!!!"
4,"So many great things to say about this place where do I begin.... WITH THE HOUSE MARGARITAS OF COURSE!! Hands down THE best house margarita I have EVER had. No syrups or mixes, this is straight tequila and lime juice baby, very refreshing and delicious! And for 4 bucks on a Monday evening, how can you go wrong? Their specials are all very good: Margarita Monday (as mentioned) with half price Apps, and Taco Tuesday with their dollar tacos and $2 tecates...HELL YA.  They have a great range of tacos here and all are pretty delicious. Try the nachos with Al Pastor on them too, delicioso! Their chips and salsas also kick ass.  If youre looking for a low key place to hang out, snack, and drink then youll enjoy this place and if you love margaritas then youll REALLY enjoy this place"
5,"Ive brought my dogs here and met with both Dr. Holmes and Dr. Edwards and they were both extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Over the last 15 years of living in Phoenix we brought all 6 dogs that we have had in that time to come see them and I wouldnt go anywhere else. This past summer I moved to Boston and regrettably havent found a quality veterinary hospital like Pecan Grove. Ashamedly, even after talking to my current vet and be unsatisfied with their answers, we called Pecan Grove and Dr. Holmes was very helpful and was even able to reference cases and articles to us over the phone. While the answer we got from our Boston vet sounded more like they were guessing than actually knowing the answer. Pecan Grove and everyone there is amazing and I wouldnt go anywhere else (had I not moved across the country)"
4,only been here twice but the food kicked ass both times!  biscuits and gravy is the way to go here.  prices are right as well.  definately recommend this joint. seems to be about a 10 minute wait to get seated.  not bad.
3,"I have been here for breakfast twice.  Both times the food was very good (love the biscuits and gravy!).  It is a bit of an older building and everything looks a bit run down.  Service has not been phenomenal.    Last time we arrived the host person had just left to seat the couple that walked in before us.  The manager and FOUR additional servers were standing at the cash register chatting.  As the entry way is small..I could hear their conversation.  It was just chit chat...not a meeting, nothing important....but apparently not one of them could see fit to either acknowledge our existence or walk us to one of the many open tables.  After a few minutes the host came back and took us to our table.  I assumed the manager just felt that taking a group to their table (or asking one of the wait staff to do it) was beneath her.  But then as soon as we were taken away, she promptly seated the family that walked in behind us.  Grrrrr...   I enjoy the food, the portions are large.  The food is very heavy comfort food.  Service is so-so and the manager does not seem to care about her customers.   If not for the service I would give them a 4."
5,"This has become one of my favorites.  Theyre friendly,  reasonably priced and the food is always delicious.  My husband and I have tried a number of their items, but my personal favorites are the BBQ pork appetizer, house fried rice, the mushu and lemon chicken.  My husband also loves the house fried rice, the mushu and the orange chicken.  One of the things that is so wonderful about this place is, the food isnt heavy.  The sauces are light and fresh tasting.  Plus, Im lucky enough to be in their delivery zone.  When I get delivery, the food is still hot and tastes like it was made just a few minutes earlier. I have yet to be disappointed by anything Ive ordered here, and to me, thats a sign of a good restaurant."
5,"This is true personal training at a fraction of the cost. Its fast, convenient, clean & friendly! You choose the style of fitness YOU want, and your workout program will be designed specifically for YOU. And you will see your progress after each session. AWESOME!!! I like it so much Im going 6 days a week!"
2,"In a word: Kitsch. This 50s palace of pink serves up a number of ice cream dishes, including favorites such as banana splits and brownie sundaes as well as build your own creations.  The ice cream itself was underwhelming, I was expecting a homemade recipe, but was a little surprised when I saw tubs of Dreyers being brought into the front dining room. Given its location in Old Town Scottsdale, a venerable dumping ground of knick knacks galore, Sugar Bowl was exactly what I expected in terms of decor and atmosphere, kitsch, kitsch and more kitsch. Where is Gelateria Parmalat when you need it?"
5,"Awesome loose leaf tea spot in the North Phoenix area. You can have a cup/pot of tea in-house, or buy a variety of teas to go. HUGE selection of loose leaf teas. If youre a tea fan, a visit to Souvia is a must-do."
2,"Good food, tiny portions, pricey for the amount you get."
2,"Made the mistake of coming here on opening day.  Not a good idea for someone with anxiety issues.  They had a bunch of really good deals, but I fear it is probably going to be the same as going to Walmart.  And I HATE going to walmart."
2,With all the hype before this place even opened I epxected a whole lot better. There are so may flavors lacking in the basic tacos. The tamales are so generic and dry. The place is nice and clean and the staff is friendly and the little salsa bar is a nice addition which I had to give this place 2 stars. If you want geat tacos go to Gallo Blanco or to Americas.
2,"So, Ive been going to to Allure for pedis for about a year.  Theyre located very close to my house so its mainly been a convenience thing.  The techs are hit and miss.  Some are awesome and really do a good, thorough job. But overall its usually a pretty neutral experience.  The last couple of times I went in they were just rude.  The girl who did my last pedi  (about 2 weeks ago) got rude when I wouldnt accept her upsales......did a sloppy job on my polish and wouldnt fix a mistake when she made when she slipped on my flip flop.  On Thursday (NY eve) I went in for a mani....the sloppiest mani I have EVER had.  She soaked my right hand for all of 10 seconds before starting my cuticles.  When I flinched when she cut my finger she slammed her tools on the table, grabbed the water bowl that my left hand was still in (slopped water), stood up and said, ""No manicure, polish change"".  When she came back, I tried to explain I did want a manicure, not only a polish change.  She raised her voice and said that I was too jumpy ""Everything hurt you"".  Well, she did my polish....horrible job!! About 1/4"" from my cuticle....it looked just dreadful.  While I was waiting for my polish to dry there was a man giving another women a pedi......she told him 3 times (!!!) he was hurting her and he just laughed and said ""it tickles""??  She said NO, it HURTS.  Im done with this place.  There are plenty of these cookie cutter shops around.....They need to re-check their customer service skills.  This was just wrong!!"
3,Had lunch here with Robyn N. and Rand H. the food here was ok and I liked it better before they did the so called renovation.All they did was add a mongolian BBQ and wash the windows. Some of my favorite things on the buffet were gone so I am dropping them down to 3 stars but still it was a good lunch.
4,"Small, but well stocked.  All of the Japanese basics are here.  Its nice to have a local Japanese grocer and not have to resort to an Asian-Mega-Mart.  Theres not a lot of fresh produce, but great frozen and dry goods options.  Ill have to try the prepared food sometime.  They were sold out for the day by the time I went in the afternoon."
3,"So, Ill admit that Im a ***bertos addict...I truly crave this food and Im not really sure why.  My mom says that she ate nachos w/ jalepenos on a regular basis while pregnant with me.  Maybe that explains it.  Anyway, Ive been wanting to try this place forever since they claim to have ""the best tortillas in town.""  I seized the opportunity to check it out since I had to drop a friend off at the airport this morning.    The exterior certainly leaves a lot to be desired, and the ambiance is about on par with the drunk tank at the fourth avenue jail (a good friend spent a most unfortunate night here and described it in detail).  The cold, stained cement floors, nasty old booths and 70s McDonalds style swivel plastic chairs which likely  needed a new coat of paint back in the early 80s.  I decided on a green chile burrito and my companion ordered the egg/chorizo/potato/cheese burrito.  After waiting for about 5-10 minutes, our number was called.  The first thing I noticed was that the burritos were quite small.   I knew, however, that I was in for a real treat with the piping hot, super chewy freshly made tortilla, and I was not disappointed.  The green chile, while tasty, had too much liquid and after inadvertantly puncturing my tortilla, I was left with a handful of sauce.   I certainly felt more than safe inside this place (despite the somewhat scary clientele) based on the table of twelve Phoenix police officers sitting across from us.  Overall, I would give the atmosphere 1.5 stars, and the food 3.75 stars.   It was definitely different than what Im used to, and it gave me a small taste of the cultural melting pot known as South Phoenix."
5,"I always look forward to a haircut with my fave Barber, David. $13 always gets me the cut I want. I used to head down to a another Barber off of Central Ave but never got the haircut I wanted. Now I never have to worry about that. So if youre ever in need of a Barber shop cut, give David or one of his gals a try. Cheers!"
5,"Special. Not on menu. Chicken strawberry raspberry blackberry blueberry goat cheese salad with raspberry vinagerette. This was THE best salad Ive ever had, and probably top 5 best meals in my life."
2,"Lets satrt with the good, The brisket was a solid 7 on a 10 point scale. I didnt like much else about a place even though I have been wanting to try for some time. It was cold and rainy today and I really wanted some comfort food just as I was passing BE BBQ. So I stopped in and sat at the bar. From the moment I walked in and sat down The poorly trained bartender struggled with every step. It was also very obvious that the well trained staff was frustrated with him to no end. The Bartender knocked a plate of food out of one servers hand a the entrence to the kitchen, he couldnt settle a check with special instruction twice, and his amaturish drink pouring skills shined bright on this cold and cloudy day. OK Yelpers I admit Im a 20 years restaurant veteran and maybe thats why I was so stressed out watching the goings on but he things I was seeing was like a train wreck! but I just couldnt help but watch. On to the food, I had extreemly high expectaions about the food and I even expected the prices to be on the Scottsdale side of high. What I wasnt expecting was the tiny BBQ Brisket sandwich, and I mean like 3 bites tiny.The BBQ Sauce was so heavy with chili powder and with almost no vinager  it was gritty. The fries served with the ""sadwich"" were also covered with tons of chili powder. The meat itself was tender and flavorfull and well smoked, but I was surprised that it was a cold, that was a turn off, but not as much as the small chintzy portion. Well at least Big Earls is off my bucket list of must try restaurants, and as far as BBQ options in Scottsdale well that list is certainly shorter too."
3,"FEZ... The two times that I went it was in the afternoon on the weekend. Both times, I was able to enjoy a great lunch with my sister and cousin and then again with my sister. The two dishes I liked were the FEZ burger and the Casa Blanca Chicken.  The berry shortcake was good, however the water from the strawberries sort of killed the whipped cream and the shortcake (biscuit) was very good. Overall the environment during those times were peaceful and quiet. The staff offered advice on the menus. The price a little high for my wallet but I would definitely come back to splurge with great company in tow."
5,"I have completed this run (obviously not the 27th annual edition) 5 times now. The course is always the same - a bit hillier than other Papgo courses as it takes a right along the sidewalk behind the zoo, but the organization is always excellent. The t-shirt is another good draw to this event - a long sleeve shirt that changes color in the sun. There is always food at the end, a raffle, and a great crowd. One of the best events on the racing calendar each year and an excellent way to start the new year off right!"
5,"Still 5 stars, but sadly Amber is closing up shop.  Dont feel bad for her as it is not for the lack of business.  She is getting married and leaving the state and taking Spoken with her.  Damn her!!!  I did pick up some jeans and 3 shirts, all at 60% off.  So hurry over and pick up some bargains!  And wish Amber good luck!"
3,"Marriotts beds are always the most comfortable out of all the hotels Ive stayed. I would not recommend Marriott Phoenix Airport for an extended (more than a week) stay, though. All in all, the hotel is nice, and the staff is probably the friendliest I have dealt with in a long time.  There is no free WiFi, and youd think that a chain like Marriott would provide it for free. There are no refrigerators or microwave ovens in the rooms, either."
4,"The food was amazing and beautifully presented. The atmosphere was clean, quiet, serene."
5,"Not many places that you can go and get a natural casing charred white hot dog outside of western NY. Folks I know from Western NY love this place, and I have to agree (even though Ill still take a good Chicago dog any day). I know where Ill be going if I ever have an itch for a white hot. :)"
4,"Great white sangria and margaritas!!!  We went for dinner, but ended up ordering appetizers and a pitcher of white sangria. All I can say is the service was great but the drinks are amazing!!!  The tortilla chips  were fresh and homemade.  The ceviche was so tasteful!"
5,"Okay... just let me say, these guys are the best! My family and I stayed in Scottsdale for 5 weeks this past summer and we frequented Baskin Robbins almost every single night. No kidding. And, yes, my butt thanks me not for such goings on. But at any rate, we have never met such a friendly ice cream staff. I am a PITA when it comes to ordering my ice cream -- I like jamoca ice cream with almonds mixed in, then I like my fudge on the side and I like extra fudge. This sort of ice cream order has raised a few brows, and furrowed some in the past, but not here, not these guys! And the couple of times, my rice-high (from the sushi place next door) son dropped his cone on the floor, they were so kind and understanding about it, they just scooped up the mess while they joked around with my little one about all the ice cream theyve had to wipe off the floor in the past with other customers, and made him a fresh new cone, adding extra sprinkles, for good measure. Viola! No more tears and only big smiles from that moment on. They really are the best! I cant wait to visit them again! :)"
4,"Gils.. A relatively new business to the complex on 16th St and Bell Rd.  Gils is NOT your average Mexican Style food. It is New Mexican Style. They use whole beans, no lard and light on flavor. The rice is not orange but more of a yellow with hints of garlic infused. The burritos are covered in red or green sauce, which can be a hot or mild depending on the crop.  I had the pork Carnitas burrito topped with green sauce. Beans and rice. I would have been disappointed it I expected smashed refried beans too. BUT I love the beans as they are. They are sort of like a ham hock style bean. The carnitas was wonderful and huge. filled with pork and not a spec of fat in it. Topped with cheese and Hatch Green Chilie sauce. Did I mention Huge?  The whole meal including water and chips and salsa set me back $10 bucks. I even have a small lunch for tomorrow. The chips are homemade and the thicker type. The red salsa was spicy but not hot and green was good.  The rest of the menu looked good, nothing stood out as a must have but I will be back.  The place was clean and they made a nice patio outside, complete with waterfall and everything."
4,"This was my first time ""hiking"" and we did it in flip flops.  We were here on a Saturday afternoon after going to the zoo.  There werent really any signs telling us where to go and some of the parking was blocked off.  There also wasnt a trail head (which I thought was normal) so we just parked randomly in some ramada and walked up.   The view is amazing and probably only took us10 min to walk up there.  Definitely recommend going for a ""hike"" up here if you are in the area."
5,"Visiting a friend who insisted we come to Carolinas on my first morning in town to get a breakfast burrito To Die For. She was totally spot-on. These delicious hand-made tortillas are fantastic!  I wish I could take a bunch back to Seattle with me, but since theyre freshly-made, Im guessing the lack of preservatives will make that a better idea than reality. I enjoyed the chorizo, egg, and potato burrito with plenty of salsa.  I loved the spicy/smooth combo with the sour cream in the burrito. I hope I get a chance to eat here again before leaving town!"
3,"We went on a Saturday night and the place was completely dead. There was only one other couple in the entire restaurant section. Very nice decor, but the food was mediocre at best. The only reason this place gets 3 stars is because the service was outstanding."
3,"I love a greasy burger joint so I wanted to try Smashburger.  I took my order to go.  The layout of the store is different than most burger place...a rather minimalist front counter.  The service was quick, and I received my food in a reasonble amount of time.  It was hot and fresh.  I ordered the 1/3 Smashburger with everything and Smashfries.  The burger was ok.  It was spiced in the same way that Hamburger Works or the Chuckhouse does their burgers.   The veggies on the burger were fresh.  The bun started to fall apart about the time I finished the burger.  overall...it was just ok.  It aint no Lenny Burger.  Id rather go to Fatburger then Smashburger.  The fries were crispy and flavored.  They were good.  When I first saw them I thought the portion was rather small, but when I took it out of the box in which they came, it appeared to be a normal portion. I wont avoid the place if people want to go there...but I wont make a special trip."
4,"Hungry and footsore near the end of a marathon shopping trip for the 13 year old, we decided to pause here for a bit of rest and refreshment, despite the low yelp ratings. We had a decent experience here. Maybe they have made some improvements recently? I really enjoyed the little bit of complimentary bean dip that I was able to snatch between the giant scoops that my oldest son kept shoveling into his mouth. The salsa had a tasty kick to it, and the chips were extra large, thin, and crispy. The eldest ordered the poco chimis off of the appetizer menu. Much as he liked them, he was full with 2 chimis left. My husband (who received the leftovers) found the filling a bit dry, and the jalapeno cream cheese too bland to deserve the jalapeno in its name. My green corn tamales were a tad sweet for my taste, reminiscent of El Torito sweet corn cake. No problem though, since the youngest gobbled up half!  Ambiance was comfortable and service was polite and efficient. My only complaint is that they never refilled the chip bowl even though it ran empty before our orders came out. 3.5 stars"
1,"we visited on april 15th and And also Sunday April 22.. I have twice now gone to your restaurant and twice been told that I couldnt use my BOGO coupon. The first time my mother went to pick up our order, she was told we didnt order the right food and we had to order off the main entress. The second time we ordered, I was told that we had to order off of the DINER SELECT menu. I did not have my coupon handy, and when I was able to read it, it says specifically, ""Offer valid for one complimentary Diner Select with the purchase of another entree. Complimentary Diner Select must be of equal or lesser value to purchase entree. Valid entrees include SIGNATURE DISHES, BOWLS, SALADS, DINER SELECTS AND LETTUCE WRAPS."" So why, on two separate occasions were we told conflicting information and not allowed to use the coupon, thus spending a small fortune on food, TWICE?!?!? Your customer service is far from what it used to be and I doubt you will be getting more of our business any time in the near future."
4,"The price is right! 16 bucks for two huge lunches, chips & salsa and two drinks. If youre looking for upscale, squeaky clean and Scottsdalish, this aint your place. If youre looking for good Mexican food, at reasonable prices, quick service and great flavor head on over to Carolinas."
3,"I went out here tonight with a couple of clients.  I had heard some good things about it, and they were from back East, so I thought to myself, ""why not?""  I must admit I was not that impressed with it all. We came here for dinner.  Started out with some apps, and ordered the Monster Platter.  Complete with ""sliders"" on it that rivaled a Jumbo Jack for shear size, this could easily feed a family of four for a week.  Thank God there were 10 of us.  Most everyone ordered steak for dinner, and most were impressed.  I, on the other hand, was not that impressed.  All I could taste on my steak was butter, not meat.  I almost had to reach for the A1 Sauce, a cardinal sin in my mind with steak, just to make it edible. Since we all had a round of golf in the morning, none of us opted for the giant 3-liter beer option they had.  But the booze selection, including wine, was quite impressive.  Service all around was very attentive.  And for those of you that love your barely-18 and barely-100lbs servers that Scottsdale is serving up on a daily basis, this is a great place for you. There were a few people in our group that opted for the bull ride, a nice little touch that gave this place that little something extra to set it apart from the other Old Town places.  All things considered, I dont think Id head back here.  I can get a better steak at a Chilis-type place, and the atmosphere (comprised mainly of your younger Scottsdale-types) didnt really do all that much for me. A couple other things of note:  their happy hour only goes until 6:30 (boo!!) but they do have a daily brunch that, strictly reading off the menu, did not look half bad.  I may have to check that out some day."
4,"Looking for good Philadelphia street eats? Well, Forefathers Cheesesteaks & Fries is the place for you! While Forefathers is light on Philadelphia decor like the Liberty Bell, the sandwiches would give fan favorite Philly restaurants like Pats, Genos or Jims a run for their money. And you dont have to be a Cheese Whiz fan. The gooey provolone on my sandwich left my mouth watering. The sweet potato fries were equally good. Be sure to sample the available dipping sauces like ranch, honey mustard, or (my fave) fries sauce. The next time youre in the mood for cholesterol count busting goodness, be sure to check this place out. Even Ben Franklin wouldnt need his bifocal specs to see that Forefathers is worth a fry...oops, I mean, try."
4,"I really like Fresh and Easy. Ive actually come to dread any time I need to go into a Safeway, Bashas, or Frys. Theyre too big! I live alone, I spend most evenings cooking my own meals, and I am on a budget. Fresh and Easy is just right for me. And on the plus side, over the past two years F&E has really grown in the right ways. They carry more varieties of fresh produce now. (I used to get upset that I couldnt buy leeks at F&E. I can now.) They have more specialty food items. (I cook a lot of vegan, Indian, Thai, and Mexican food. Used to need to make two grocery trips, but no longer.) Unlike some of the other reviewers, I really like their prepared foods. I mean, no prepared food will ever be as good as my own cooking, but if Im in a hurry, its good! They also have really great coupons. The weekly mailer has a $3 off $30 coupon at the least. I recently got a $5 off $25. And they now have the F&E Friends card which, on the simplest level, gives you money back for the money you spend. Sure, its not a whole lot, but Ill take what I can get! The employees are always helpful, and have become much better baggers than in years past. (Im picky about how my groceries are arranged inside of my reusable bags!) Needless to say, Fresh and Easy has won me over, and unless I learn that they use the tears of kittens to shine the floors (or something equally extreme), Ill continue to go back for my groceries."
4,"I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai and Green Curry, YUMMY food was very good, ordered it spicy and it came about medium.  But the food was what I wanted and expected, service was good I asked for an opinion on the curry and the waiter happened to agree with everything I asked.  ""how about this is this good, YES he would reply"" made me wonder if he had tried it all.  Beer and wine are both served.  I liked this place and will return."
2,"Despite being a red-blooded American male, I find this place a bit below average.  Yes, the waitress wander around in shorts that would make a cheerleader blush--but rail thin bottle blondes dont do anything for me or the food itself.   Ive eaten here twice: the first time, I ordered huevos rancheros and coffee; today, I had the protein pancakes.  In both cases, the service was mixed and the food was bland.  My food came out quickly both times, but my server disappeared each time as well.  Today, I sat for 15 minutes until I was able to get the attention of a manger who located my server for me.  The food itself is not bad, but nothing to cheer about.  The protein pancakes were enormous and dense, but not nearly as flavorful as one expects from an item filled with almonds, blueberries, and cinnamon.  As others have noted, theyll ding you on side orders--sour cream, tomatoes, guacamole, and the like will all cost you a pretty penny for diner-quality stuff. Finally, it doesnt affect the food, but the decor is garish and plain.  Remember that first apartment you got after college with the white walls and tan carpet?  This is basically the US Egg aesthetic."
4,"I will be very brief.......the food is fantastic,!!!!! The service is hard to figure out though. Lots of staff but we were constantly looking for our waiter, the water guy, the plate remover guy. All seemed to be on break simultaneously. I strongly recommend eating at the bar until they get the staff better trained."
2,"This place looks sleek from the causeway, but the food is marginal. We had the veggie taco plate and the veggie burrito. Both lacked flavor, even the ""spicy"" salsa was bland. Server was friend and attentive, that is the only reason I am giving it two stars. I would just go here for a drink next time and skip the food entirely."
5,"This place has been here 7 years and we have never been. Are you kidding me? The food is excellent. The people who work here are friendly and seem to be happy to be there, which is most important. I tried the make your own half salad and half sandwich. YUMMY!!! There are many choices for salad toppings. There us nothing I like more than a huge, fresh salad. I chose to top my salad with avocado, tomato, bacon, edemame, feta cheese, and whipped balsamic vinaigrette. I really think this was the best salad I have ever had! They make the salad in front of you and mix in the perfect amount of dressing. I chose the chicken pesto sandwich. The combo of these items was a perfect portion for this hungry girl. The sandwich was excellent. My hubby ordered the Cuban pork sandwich. This is one huge sandwich! It was difficult to get his mouth around it, but once he did, it was awesome!! Typically, we dont like coleslaw, but it was really good, especially combined with the tender pork. We will return to the Market Bistro, again and again.  Loved it!!!!"
5,"Amazing cheesesteak. One mile from my home is Corleones. About 15-20 minutes from my home is Capriottis. I never go to Corleones. I go to Capriottis all the time. The workers here are nice and the cheesesteak is terrific. The large is 20"" I believe, so if youre ordering for yourself and in no mood to eat until you have a stroke, get the medium. Also, try it with the hot peppers. It adds the slightest bit of spice without becoming too overwhelming. Thats really all I can say about this place. Wonderful cheesesteak. I havent tried anything else because the cheesesteak is too good to pass up when I make the drive down there. The patrons rave about the other sandwiches, though, so I absolutely would not be afraid to try something else. Theres maybe 5 or 6 tables inside and 2 outside? so be prepared to order to go if you arrive at prime dine-in lunch/dinner hours. Do yourself a favor and go to Capriottis. Help this place attain the reviews and ratings it deserves. The fact that theres only 8 reviews is criminal. I understand it is in the heart of the suburbs, but its worth the drive."
4,"Great work lunch. Valet parking, only. Waitress was helpful in narrowing down my selection (salmon salad) and listened to my criteria. 4 stars since wait staff seemed otherwise aloof."
5,Love Sams Club! Especially those little red velvet cupcakes and Chocolate wine ... the best! We always do most of our grocery shopping here. Always a treat.
3,"Some highlights - Loved the special of the day: red velvet pancakes breakfast with cream cheese topping. YUM YUM YUM - Corned beef hash is canned and not homemade :( sad face - Fried Chicken breakfast is a huge portion- tasted really well but definitely sad that they only have sausage gravy. Would love it if they could offer a non pork gravy for the non oink eaters.  Overall, it was delicious, simple menu, great service (Thanks to Waitress Kelly she was really nice) and would much rather support local eateries than Ihop or Dennys anyday."
4,"3 stars for a great happy hour. 1 extra star for having happy hour 7 days a week (from 3pm-7pm). If more places did happy hour every day of the week, Id be drinking and eating all the time...oh, wait.  Anyway, heres the happy hour download:  -Wine by the glass: $2 off -Domestic bottles: $3 -Draft beers: $4 -Sangria: $4 -Specialty Cocktails: $7 In addition, they also have multiple food items at the $4, $6 and $8 price points.  We sampled the ""Lemoncello"" (in quotes because it should be ""Limoncello"" - note to management) martini as well as the Grapefruit Basil Fizz. Both were delicious, although the basil one was definitely the best. For food, we had the spinach artichoke dip and the arancini (rice balls). Neither was amazing but a great value for the money.  I thought the service was attentive and efficient, although the food runners needed to learn which spot at the bar was which table number since they kept delivering other peoples food to us.  Finally, while this has zero impact on my review, there is a very bizarre picture of a dark-haired shirtless man with dark chest hair in a very flirtatious pose hanging in the womens restroom. As my Facebook friend pointed out, it looks more like bad 80s porn than restaurant wall art. While entertaining, it probably makes sense to replace with some generic pic of the Colosseum or something!"
5,"I love this place.  Great food, great service from some of the nicest staff, and just a fun place to go.  It is also a place I like to meet people for happy hour.  They have a wonderful selection of beers, fantastic wines, and I have never once had anything but great food while eating there."
1,"Banfield is okay for routine check ups for maintenance and preventive care. That is why they offer a ""wellness plan"". When it comes to your animal getting sick, I would go elsewhere. It should not be called a Hopital. The doctors are there for profit only and do not show any care for your pet. The vet techs care, but the doctors dont listen to them. This place is lacking ethics when it comes down to making important decisions when it comes to your pets health."
2,"Over-priced, over-salted and thoroughly unimaginative. Package those adjectives up in a pretty little nutshell and youve got Arcadia Tavern. Arcadia Tavern is a family-friendly, bland and inoffensive, if not overpriced, alternative to Applebees or TGI Fridays.  I was seriously enthused when a tavern opened up within a five minute walk of my house. I like drinking and I like walking. Combine the two and you get stumbling, which can also have its high points, ripped jeans notwithstanding. But Arcadia Tavern is no tavern. No self-respecting tavern can commit the cardinal sins of happy hour and retain their integrity. Cardinal rule #1: Thou shalt not end happy hour before 7 pm.  Seriously. What is it with places trying to redefine Happy Hour as the hours between 3 and 6 pm? I understand that from a price point perspective the 3-4 or 4-5 pm hours are much cheaper than extending food and drink discounts to the 6-7 pm crowd. But I consider that the same as shining up a turd and calling it a custom made gift. Ooo, you offer three hours of happiness? Pity I can only make 15 minutes of it.  Bottom line is 5 pms whistle blowing time, gridlock makes a girl crave a drink and 6-7 pm is the prime hour for getting that drink on. To end happy hour before 7pm pretty much guarantees happy hour barflies will not frequent the establishment. Flipside: Three dollar Dos Equis, all day, every day. At least theres that. Cardinal rule #2: Thou shalt offer more than frozen food and canned items as appetizers, and if offering cheap frozen crap, it shall be reflected in the price.  Fries, tater tots, onion rings, wings, mozzarella sticks, chicken strips, and the ubiquitous spinach and artichoke dip? Whoa. Dont strain yourself, TGI Fridays.  My main gripe is with the monster nachos. Maybe Im just taking crazy pills, but the chips, seasoned shredded chicken and nacho cheese were all wicked salty. Were talking mouth-puckering, tastebud-slaughtering salt laden nachos topped with canned pickled jalapenos (gross), black olives (more salt) and black beans (respect).  Im also biased against the unnatural plastic consistency of nacho cheese. It makes everything soggy and is a tacky substitute for the real deal. Cheese should crisp up around the edges and pull apart in delectable strings, not ooze sadly over a mass of chips and overpower everything else on the plate. I will say that the guacamole and pico de gallo that topped the nachos were delicious, tasted homemade and were a saving grace, but they were also woefully underrepresented compared to the macnasty nacho sauce.  Flipside: The three mini sliders (albeit meager) and grilled veggies platter with hummus showed promise.  Cardinal rule #3: Thou shalt provide affordable drink and nosh. So whats that nacho monstrosity going to run you? Twelve bucks. Dont blink. You read right. Twelve dollars for salty garbage. Mozzarella sticks? 7. Dozen wings? 9! Completely unrealistic. Shave a couple bucks off each appetizer and youre in the reasonable price zone, particularly considering the cheap tasting ingredients. Taking that first impression into account, I dont think Im going to shell out 10-12 dollars for a hamburger (without fries) when I could go to Delux and have my socks blown off with flavor for cheaper or to the Chicago Hamburger Co. for pennies in comparison.  Flipside: There is no positive here. For the caliber of food offered, the prices are completely unrealistic. Even the desserts are overpriced. Six bucks for a root beer float? Thats a big middle finger right there. Arcadia Tavern, as a representative of the Happy Hour enforcement squad, I hereby declare you undeserving of your title. Four Peaks is a tavern. The Vine is a tavern. Icehouse is a tavern. Hell, even Carlsbad Tavern does it better and they have plastic bats hanging from the ceiling.  I regret that I shall never again spend a happy hour in your warm embrace. Although you may still win me over with $3 you-call-its on Thursday after 9 pm. Particularly when accompanied by a little goldfish racing.  I totally hate goldfish, too. At least share that in common."
3,"Great tourist fare. When we have family in town that appreciate a 32oz porterhouse more than a delicate sashimi, this is where we head. It is quite the drive from Phoenix, but portions are large and service is always prompt and friendly."
4,"Located in the W Hotel in Old Town Scottsdale, this hipster hangout is always busy.  I recommend a reservation if youre planning to dine here.  The Better Half and I drop in here from time to time.  Since I dont eat Sushi, I order: Ji-Dori Chicken Skewers withTeriyaki Sauce - $10 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DwP10iEz5LGf3fhcVQZm0Q?select=x_60nAIMvJX9k_s9HAPiOA Filet Mignon wrapped Asparagus with Soy Mirin Sauce - $15 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DwP10iEz5LGf3fhcVQZm0Q?select=19cHPtx8ahwZTPC5xIARFQ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DwP10iEz5LGf3fhcVQZm0Q?select=_4XhXTuYKQnypHmylm-mQg And for Dessert, a warm Chocolate Cake...yum! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DwP10iEz5LGf3fhcVQZm0Q?select=KoyBtoSTBrhM2dLD8zs_PA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DwP10iEz5LGf3fhcVQZm0Q?select=iKBiwthdGtENIqWfGK1V1A The Chicken Skewers are very tasty.  The Teriyaki Sauce they are glazed are sweet and have the right amount of ""sour"" kick to it to balance the flavor.  The Filet Mignon wrapped Asparagus is awesome...the Filet is tender and juicy and the Asparagus compliments it well.  Of course, the Chocolate Cake dessert is a nice ending for the meal. The service can be a bit slow at times, depends on the server.  Generally speaking, its pretty good considering how busy they are. The people watching here is pretty good...watching all of the hipsters is hilarious. Return Factor - 93%"
5,"I just started taking my car here a few months ago. Someone from their business stopped by my office building with donuts and coupons for a 60,000 mile check up, and thats how they got my business. I brought my car there for a routine oil change, and they did the 60,000 mile check up which was very useful. Of course there was the usual list of things I should fix, but they never made me feel like an idiot or that they were taking advantage of me, which I cant say for most mechanics. The other thing I really like about them is they give me a ride to and from work, so I can get maintenance done on my car without missing work or worrying about how Im going to get back to the shop. Bill and the other guys that work there are all very friendly and I definitely trust them with my car needs."
4,Older clientele (dont go here for a hip salon) but solid professionals who know how to cut hair without messing it up :)  Thought it was a little weird getting water in a ceramic coffee mug...I think plastic cups or water bottles would be better.
4,"Found this place online and we checked it out on Saturday night. It was empty when we got there around 6pm so we were a bit nervous, but the hostess told us it was a late crowd usually and the place was pretty full by the time we left. The food was superb. One of the reasons we chose to dine here was because they offer grass fed organic meats and we split a burger that was very tasty (in fact, neither my wife or I had eaten beef in almost two years!). We also split a great salad with a well cooked Ahi steak and had the bruschetta as well. The whole menu was interesting and well definitely be back. The real surprise was the beer selection. Wow. I had a tough time choosing, and then the waitress told me about the special and it sounded so good I couldnt pass it up. It was an agave wheat beer from Breckenridge and it was very tasty.  Great little neighborhood place and well definitely be back. Hope it sticks around as the spot has had poor luck with restaurants."
5,Good food at a good price.
1,"The guy who worked the front door Sunday night deserves to be fired.  Sound harsh?  Not at all. Had a supervisor overheard how he treated my friend he would have agreed. We pull up in the car.  It looks fine from the outside so we send in one of the five of us in to scope it out (check the menu, see if theres seating etc). Normal behavior.  So my friend K, approaches the guy at the door and asks ""what type of food is served here?"" expecting a simple response like  ""American"" or ""here let me grab you a menu."" Ready for this...??  His response: ""human food"" HUMAN FOOD?!?!?! HUMAN FOOD!??!?! K is just an average potential customer, asking a fair easy to answer question. Okaaaaay. Being the sweetheart K is, she goes with it (it: him being a meeeeeanie) and asks if there is outdoor seating. He sarcastically, mockingly and and outright D-bagly points out how there is a seat yourself sign right nearby.  How was this guy ever hired? Again a more appropriate responds (TOOL:) would have been ""yea, the patio seems like it has some space tonight, AND ID BE HAPPY TO GO CHECK FOR YOU"" or ""at this fine establishment its seat yourself but usually the outside turns over quickly.""  Sunday nights fine joke machine at the front door: I could happily give you several other decent responses you could have said to an innocent patron. Everyone and their mom has had some turn at being a waiter/hostess/manager/bartender etc etc in the food and hospitality industry, be it in AZ, SF, WHEREVER and KNOWS the #1 101 rule is:  BE KIND TO THE GUEST (kiss@$$ , the customer is always right etc.) Add to that list: answer straightforward questions from your guests with flat out, non-acrimonious answers! Granted this review can say nothing about this establishement beyond the front door because we never made it that far."
2,"Despite not being Federal employees in any way, Memorial Day seems to be a time when restaurateurs think they deserve a day off, leaving me with few actual lunch options and relegating me to the worst of the worst: Eating. In an AIRPORT RESTAURANT. Turns out that Taberna wasnt actually as bad as all that - the bar is nice to spend a few hours waiting for your flight, and the titular Blue Burrito - despite not being blue in any way, shape or form - wasnt too bad by fast food standards, and quite plentiful for the $8 I spent on it. And if you dont like it, you can cover it with Cholula, close your eyes, and pretend youre eating somewhere better."
2,"If you like Houstons, this is like Houstons creepy cousin that isnt quite right.  Its Bizzaro Houstons.  The food is just gross.  I didnt like anything about it.  You do get a TON of food...but none of it is good.  I got the pork tenderloin...it was gross.  I ended up sending the meat back and just ate the mashed potatoes with the sauce...thats all I could stomach.  (The prices are about the same as Houstons, however.)  I couldnt believe how packed this place was...no one at our table liked their food.  A few of my coworkers went there as well and there were no good comments about it."
3,"Cherry on Top is a rare example of design by market analysis committee, who couldnt decide on a unique concept so they decided to ""borrow"" from all of their competitors styles, turning out at least as well as if not better than its individual inspirations. The result provides convenient answers to the following frozen yogurt questions: - Cant decide between tart and traditional? Why not both? - Cant decide between standard or high-end sweet? Mix vanilla, taro, green tea, cheesecake (but only at your own risk.) - Feeling constrained by four fit all sizes? $0.39/oz., cup weight subtracted. - Wavering on the topping healthiness spectrum? Fruit to sugar cereal to nuts to crushed big brand candy available. The quality is close enough to most of the relevant rivals (as long as one is not requiring the desert honey Sweet Republic tart variant) but, correctly and perhaps intentionally, the value proposition is that most patrons wont care about the slight dip, trading off for the flexibility of purchasing (only) as much yogurt and toppings as desired while satisfying Hersheys-acclimated children with a Frankenstein of saccharine flavors and junk toppings as well guests from the city pining for the nearest Pinkberry with original tart plus kiwi, strawberries, blackberries and pineapple."
5,"Its the place to be.  I went before heading over to Symphony Hall and seeing Ballet AZ perform Giselle. Having heard great reviews about the place, its food and the vibe... I had to try it. Restored into a restaurant and bar from an old department store, Hannys has the feel straight of of New York City. The lighting is dim enough to give that sexy, intimate feelings and with long, pew style seating with individual tables, the vibe is very posh. My roommate and I ordered the bruscetta plate and the margarita pizza. Very good choice! The bruscetta plate was on the saltier side, so be wary of that but it was delish. The pizza was much bigger than we expected. For $10 you really do get a good deal.  We each orded drinks. A orded the peach martini and a glass of giseling. Wasnt a HUGE fan of the martini and I thought it tasted like cough syrup but it was also my very first martini so I am not holding Hannys against anything. My roommate on the other hand said it was the best Manhattan hed ever had, which I believe. Hannys has a modern feel with a touch of Mad Men and I simply cannot wait to go back."
4,"Tucked into a strip mall, the parking lot near the grocery store still has plenty of parking.  We came on a Monday morning so it wasnt really busy and we sat promptly.   Looking at the menu, Im looking for unique specials and being a fan of hash browns, I went with the Wolfpack.  The food itself was nothing special.  Each individual element stands on its own - 2 eggs (I chose egg whites), bacon, cheese, and plenty of hash browns, but it was a filling meal.  I had the over easy ice so it was a nice cold coffee drink for the warm weather.  My friend had the crying pig omelette which seemed pretty good.  The decor was nice and staff was pretty nice.  Although our table was right next to another, I didnt feel like either of us were intruding upon each other.  Overall, a decent place and worth visiting again to try some of their other specialties."
3,"Good sandwich! Better than all the chains, doesnt beat Jasons deli, would like black tea (not green). Fresh tasting and clean"
4,"Not bad.  Very large story that has about everything youd want, and open 24 hours."
4,Good food and great service.  Staff is very friendly and attentive without hovering.  I would definitely go back
5,Had the mahi and it was great.  Very reasonably priced also.  Definitely a repeat.
4,"Went here for a saturday lunch with a girlfriend. The building is amazing and beautiful, very clean. Im not generally a ""Scottsdale crowd"" type of gal, but the place was nice, and the music was good too. The menu looked so delicious that we had a hard time deciding what to get. Our waiter was very kind, didnt try to rush us, and gave us plenty of time to decide.  We had a house salad, dirty chips, and an order of sliders. The house salad seemed a bit over priced for what it was, but the dirty chips were really good! The sliders were average, and well priced. I really want to go back and try a happy hour sometime to try more of the small plates, our only regret was that the order of dirty chips was BIG, we could only finish half of it. A half sized portion would have been perfect, though!"
4,Super Dark Chocolate Gelato.  Word.  Tiramisu Gelato.  Straight Up.  Super Dark Chocolate Gelato and Tiramisu together.  Good Stuff.   This store smells like a pool.  I have no idea whats up with that but the Super Dark Chocolate Gelato is awesome. I will go back just for that.  And I will order the largest size I can handle...Kids Size.  Or maybe Small if Im feeling ambitious.  Gelato is rich.  Super Dark Chocolate Gelato is Super Rich.  Youve been warned.
5,"Pita Jungle is now one of my favorite places to go for dinner. Its both affordable and healthy. Thought its usually  crowded with ""Hipster"" ASU students, I have yet to receive bad service. Our food has usually come out in a timely matter. As for the environment, Its very nicely decorated with art from local artists and its very well lit.  Its nice and open so you can see whats going on through out the restaurant. Its never to noisy, so it would be a great place to take a family or even a date. Almost every visit, Ive always gotten either the Broiled Chicken Salad or the Lavosh Shawarma Wrap. The chicken has always been moist and dish is always flavorful. The lemon vinaigrette dressing is almost good enough to drink!  Though I have not tried a lot on the menu, some of the food they bring out always make me say ""Ooh, whats that?!"""
4,In from out of town ..... Really glad we stopped here.... Excellent food nice atmosphere if I was planning to be in AZ more often I would bookmark this place.
5,Great place for Italian food. Very family friendly. Mellow atmosphere with friendly and knowledgeable staff. Never had a bad meal. My favorite is Sirloin Marsala and you can choose any pasta they have to go with it at no charge. Recommend to anyone who enjoys quality Italian for a good price.
5,"I am giving this location 5 stars cause its been my stomping grounds for atleast 12 years now, its always very good, clean, and I have never had a bad experience here. Wendys locations are just class acts, they are always my go to burger fix. I also made this my daughters first burger when she wanted to finally try one so she could have a good experience for the first one and always have a tasty burger to judge the rest by for her life. If its good enough for my daughter, then its good enough for you :) eat up and review."
2,"I am from NYC and have been in Phoenix for a few months! This Native NYer is within walking distance from my hotel. Ive been going their for about two months on Friday and Saturday nights for food, drinks and the karaoke. The food was OK, the drinks specials were good and the service was also good. The problem is that when a confrontation erupted at the bar the staff did not respond quilckly to notify the police. So, I ended up geting injured and when I asked them to call the police the did not, I had to. And after the episode they said they hoped It would not affect me not coming back again! Not even a comp or something! Just an Im sorry what happened! I will not be returning at all. I looked over my nine charges on my statements and seen I had spent over $300 their. There loss!"
3,"go to the reverse happy hour where reasonably edible sushi is served at reasonable prices amidst, in the instance of our  visit, barely legal drinking aged crowd. in a mall. nuff said."
4,"I think for my sesquicentennial review, Ive gotten to a point where Im letting the food direct the show of stars. Sure, we have the servers and cooks as producers, the location as our stage, lighting, sound and supporting staff. But the meal, ah, that is our celebrated lead actor. Without it, all other pieces may paint a pretty picture, but what good is a painting when it medium is missing?  The Mission really delivers its lines well. Almost too well. Like Dakota Fanning well. Each plate has a spectrum of flavors--bold and smoky with subtle and delicate undertones of fresh herbs. Each dish is skillfully plated and ready for its closeup. My steak tacos were so intensely flavored, I didnt really dwell on the fact there were but three petite tortilla shells mounded with strips of magnificently grilled flank steak and slices of fresh avocado. And the papas y chorizo, which I ordered as an accompaniment, helped balance the palate yet was still a strong item on its own. Robert Ms pozole was as unique as it was flavorful, delicious, satisfying and, ironically, humble. The bread pudding he ordered at the end of meal was, according to him, a premature ejaculation. Apparently, that means it was good, so Ill take his word for that. Those who joined us for this meal seemed to share some of the enthusiasm over the dessert, but I dont eat sweets so will have to believe their accolades worthy.  What, pray tell, denies The Mission of the much clamored five-star rating? Primarily, its the associated fees. On one hand, I was blown away by the sensuous flavors apparent in every edible item. On the other hand, I was blown away upon seeing the bill (especially since I had nothing but water to drink). Does one negate the other? Perhaps. Am I at a place in my life where such a statement rings true? Not necessarily. While my initial response was, I wouldnt likely return to The Mission if it was my decision, I confess that I would, willingly, give myself back to The Mission if only for the sublime sins of doting on sustenance."
4,"The Sport Chalet is a little bit of a playground for me because they have an assortment of gear and clothing for many sports and outdoor activities. Among the areas within the store that Ive visited in the past are boxing, basketball, hiking, shoes, workout clothing, swimming, & kayaking. They carry high-quality equipment from well-known brands.  The store associates are helpful too without being too pushy. Specifically, they acknowledge your presense; ask you if they can be of assistance and then move along their way. The Sport Chalet also has a free membership rewards plan as well, which is nice to have, but not necessarily the selling point for shopping here. That is, youd have to purchase a lot to accumulate a certificate for a few bucks off. Although, I probably receive a $10 off certificate at least twice a year just for being a member.  Finally, the one aspect about this store and other Sport Chalet locations that sets them apart from other large sports stores such as Sports Authority and Dicks Sporting Goods is the scuba gear and onsite scuba training they offer. You are even offered the opportunity to try it out in their back pool, which Ive experienced myself. You just have to fill out a waiver releasing the Sport Chalet from liabilities and acknowledging that you are in good health. Then, you change in your swimming gear and head out to the back to meet the PADI-certified scuba instructor. You dont have to put on much gear. Its just a pair of fins, a buoyancy compensator over your back, oxygen regulator into your mouth, and a mask. Youre guided by the instructor as you first swim near the surface and then head deeper into the pool. I did feel really awkward at first, but thats to be expected. As I left the pool and was guided to the front door of the Sport Chalet, the other scuba instructor provided some recommendations on some equipment and indicated they do not receive any commission for the sale of certain products. I totally enjoyed my first scuba experience and recommend at least trying it out at the Sport Chalet. They offer these ""try-outs"" around the spring and summer."
5,"Ill be back!  Laura certainly doesnt need my review for help, but all of these people are correct.  She is meticulous, easy to be around and takes joy in her work.  When I read all of the 5 star reviews, I sort of thought they might be written by friends because they were so gushy.  I found her via Yelp.... and loved her!  $20 eyebrow wax, takes credit cards."
5,"Healing hands!  A dedicated, professional  therapist/intricate bodyworker who listens to your needs to develope an individualized treatment.  Focused in addressing  my health concerns and goals.  A message like no other that left me  feeling restored with the added bonus of ""spot on"" nutritional advise ... an overall concern for your good health!   To feel renewed ... highly recommended!!!!!!!!"
4,"Burritos and Bodybuilders Theres not usually much decor in Chiptole.  They keep their decorations and their food simple and to the point. But if youre in the age range of 15-40, theres plenty of male eye candy.  I think I saw 3 men whos muscles were 5 times the size of mine.  In fact, most of the people in the restaurant were men.  Im not sure why or how, but it made my tacos a little tastier. ;) Enjoy! No five starts because I watched them put sugar in the rice. Theres already so much sugar in everything, we dont need more in the rice please."
4,"So wifey and I decided to check this place out for our monthly date night. Its a cool little spot around 12th st and Oak, in the middle of a neighborhood. The decor is very modern, but warm and inviting. We opted to get an appetizer and a few of the small plates rather than the larger plates they had. They had a balanced but approachable wine list, I had an awesome Tempranillo for under 10 bucks a glass!  We opted for the crispy shrimp and okra for the appetizer, which came with this spicy banana sauce and this cool yogurt sauce.  I really really liked this dish, the okra was great and the shrimp were succulent and perfectly cooked. Not sure about the banana sauce, but overall a great dish. We then decided to get the stuffed dates with crispy Schreiners Chorizo and Manchego. It came with dressed spinach, prob one of my fave dishes in Phoenix right now!  We also ordered the macaroni and cheese and I forgot to mention the toasted bread and roasted garlic we ordered. The bread and garlic was just okay, nothing special.  I, surprisingly, was not a fan of the mac and cheese either, it seemed very grainy (I know it was chock full of parmesan so thats probably what it was, but it was just unappealing to me). Overall this place has potential. Ill definitely go back, especially because we got out with 3 glasses of wine and 4 small dishes with tax and tip for under $70.00!!"
5,"We had a GREAT dinner there on Saturday.  We were celebrating my aunts birthday, and we ordered from the regular and special menus.  I had a truly wonderful chicken Madiera, my hubby had meat loaf, which is always a ""tell"" for a good place, my uncle had fried haddock which was crunchy and not at all greasy, and my aunt also had the chicken Madiera, which was fork-tender.  We also had great service - attentive without being too much, and we completely enjoyed our meal.  We will definitely visit this location again."
5,"great food... HUGE wine list (same as Kashmere)...  whatever you do make sure to get there cob salad thing (stedson chopped salad)... I substituted the salmon for chicken, but it is still out of this world... i know people that have brought in chefs from out-of-town to figure out what is in it so they can bring it home to their city... dont remember much else... but i remember i have never had anything bad since i have been going there."
2,"No, I dont want to take the bus to get to the train.  In my opinion, they didnt go far enough for people who live in Phoenix. It may be a good solution for Tempe and Mesa residents commuting to Phoenix, but it isnt effective for Phoenicians who want to get from the north valley into CenPho."
5,"Just your typical warehouse club right?  I guess that depends on your definition of typical.  Sams club has hours just for buisness members starting at 7:00am.  You can also fax in or go online and have them shop for you.  All you do is go in a pay for it. They have a few membership levels- Business, Gold Member and Premium.  The Premium level you earn 2% back on all your purchases.  They do give you two cards for the price that you pay, so you can go in with a neighbor and each get a card. In addition to electronics, photo lab, optical center, bakery, meat department, they also have a little know ""clearance"" section at each Sams.  You just have to know where it is.  Also when they are clearancing out merchandise, the price will end in a ""1"".  Most common is .71 or .81.  I have picked up 5 pound bags of mixed candy for .71 a bag, and lots of other deals just by knowing this little secret. They do discount their meat the day before they need to pull it from the shelves.  They also will give cookies to children. My boys also love the cafe where they get their ""pizza and drink please.""  Their menu has changed  a lot lately though and I am not sure if I like it.  Prices are very reasonable though. They also have gasoline pumps outside which if you know your prices can be a good thing! If you are not satified with your membership, you can cancel at anytime and they will prorate your membership refund.  Their refund policy is really good as well."
5,"Ive always been partial to Harkins Theaters because they have the best seats.  I used to say, ""You know what would be the best theater?  AMC experience, with Harkins seats.."" Guess what.. AMC Westgate is the birth of the spawn of just that.  I love this place.  Its frigging massive to start with and has everything inside it.  Not to mention an IMAX.  The experience is great and the chairs are super comfortable. Nothing really more to say that its a theater.  I do like the new Stubs card that they put out.  Yeah it sucks that you have to pay for it, but its only $12 a  year.  Not bad for all the free stuff you get. Another cool thing about this theater is the location.  If you are going to grab dinner/lunch before hand, ther eis a ton of places to choose from. Nice work AMC on making a great theater!! Ohhh big big big heads up.  Be sure to see a movie before Noon or ya get to pay nice big money.   thats probably the draw back.  Ill still give you 5 stars."
5,"Gotta love Sweet Republic.... great philosophy and great icecream and sorbets. Ive loved every single flavor Ive had there (peanut butter, brownie swirl, mint chip, salted butter caramel, mayan chocolate, and more). Everything is made from all natural, fresh ingredients (virginia peanuts, fresh mint leaves, etc).  When I really want to splurge I make my own sundae, you get to pick two flavors of icecream, a sauce, and a topping.  If you havent been to Sweet Republic, go! If youre far from Shea & 101, find them at First Fridays downtown, farmers markets, and more."
1,"Beware... use only a credit card so you can stop payment if you need to. ( our sales person encouraged us to pay cash and get a 10% discount ).  Big mistake,  Any problem youre on your own...really... On your own!  Weve spent over $3,000 at this store and it has been a nightmare.  Delivery took  weeks longer then our sales person said & our paper work indicated. There was a mistake with the fabric, the paint was mismatched, what was to take 10 days took 3 months.  Not a darn thing was handled properly.  Every call we made to ""customer service"" was routed directly  back to our  sales person. We went back to the store  in person but there is no mgr, no one except commission sales staff and a voice mail merry go round."
2,"The service was great, but like all the other Fox concepts you pay too much for mediocrity. The short rib stew was good. The ribs were cold and the chicken pasta was bland. There are just so many better options in the area... What a disappointment. But I should have known better."
5,"Contrary to the reviwers below...I love Matts. Yeah the wait is long...the place is small...once I went in the summer and I was sweating in my coffee... BUT.... This is Phoenix people. When the breakfast choices are a tasty meal at Circle K (heated under heat lamps) or Dennys and IHOP, you cant beat Matts.  I love breakfast. I eat breakfast everywhere I travel on business. I have never had a better breakfast than at Matts. Fresh ingredients, great food, excellent bread and jam...kick $ss hashbrowns. I wish the place was bigger (and cooler) and the wait not so long. But as a special breakfast treat...you cant beat it.  Just bring your own fan."
5,Beef gyros are always good here.
4,"As I revealed in a previous review, my family loves InnSuites. This location is nestled in the Squaw Peak Mountain Preserve, close to the prestigious Biltmore area, and offers easy access to downtown Phoenix, Scottsdale and the Camelback corporate corridor.  InnSuites offers comfotable, clean rooms for a very rasonable price. And as with all of the InnSuites locations, the Northern location includes amenities such as free social hour and free hot breakfast with eggs, potatoes, waffles, toast, cereal, yogurt, fruit, coffee, milk & juices. There isnt really much within walking distance at this location, so either plan to hang around the pool a lot or youll need to have a car."
4,Love this place. Every time I come here its like a high school reunion. Theres wonderful people and a perfect atmosphere for drinking.
5,"I have been frequenting this spot since they opened and have always said they were better than Starbucks but Iam in a special kind of heaven after the change in menu and addition of pressed tea lattes!!! Yum, yum, yum!!! Far better than Starbucks powdered green tea latte and roughly a dollar cheaper than the high priced cup there as well. The early morning staff is great and free WiFi is an added bonus. I can honestly say for the New Year, Im quitting you Starbucks......and mean it."
2,It seems like there is not as much value for your dollar at Gold Medal.  We had been there since the new school opened but decided to move on.  We got a cant we get you to stay call which felt like desperation on their part.  My daughter enjoyed her lessons but her favorite teacher left (as most do) and the cost was not worth it anymore.  I would not recommend them to my friends.
3,"I was on my way into Sweet Republic just before Christmas when I spotted Painted Pretzel a few doors down.  Since I love pretzels, I was imagining all sorts of delights.  Hard pretzels in knots, twists, and rods covered with the finest chocolate.  Freshly baked soft pretzels salted, or rolled in cinnamon and sugar, or butter and garlic.  You name it.  They were going to sell it. Well I was sorely disappointed.  Upon entering, I realized this is probably more of a mail order type business.  No soft pretzels, either.  They specialize in pretzels dipped in chocolate and topped with nuts, candy pieces, etc.  There were some boxes of pretzels already made up, and we purchased a few.  The honey wheat pretzel rods were actually pretty good, the small bite-sized pretzels were nothing special.  The chocolate was a nice quality, but not the best.   Although they hand dip all the pretzels, they do not make the actual pretzels.  So if youre on a local foods kick, which Im not, this isnt the place for you.  Not bad to have around the house and for gifts to pretzel lovers or corporate gifts as they are better than the products you would find in most grocery stores.  I was just hoping for a little more."
3,"I have to say that Im not a huge fan of D&Bs food. Typically if Im here its to have a couple beers and remind my husband how good I am at ski-ball. Overall, its a cool vibe with many different games to play. The drinks are affordable and you cant beat the location (Tempe Marketplace.)"
4,Like earning cheaper gas
5,"Its a restaurant in a gas station, but it merits five stars b/c it has glass bottles of soda, just like you find in Mexico.  Good food too.  Its actually not nearly as bad inside as youd think, its pretty well set apart from the gas station sales, so I wouldnt mind eating there.  They have a few tables set up inside.  I usually get takeout though (they also deliver).   MANZANA LIFT ROCKS!!!  Im also going to be drinking the Sprite in the bottle, (cane sugar ftw) and the horchata.  I dont care about Chipotle opening near work anymore, Ive found a new Mexican fix for lunch.  What a happy day."
5,Everything I have tried here is awesome! You cant go wrong with your choices! Service is ok. Could be better. Not very personable!
5,"I had lunch at Lons and wow, what a great experience.  Great food, great service and great ambiance outside.  I met the Chef at an event and he was less than friendly.  Maybe he was having a bad day?  His unfriendliness aside, this is a must try if you are  in the area."
5,"my family and i hosted my sisters graduation sendoff here and it was a great event! debbie in the events office as well as the staff she sent us to be of service throughout the event were wonderful. food was delicious - we ordered buffet style (chicken milanese, sirloin steak, appetizers, and beverages) for about 150 people.  the tech staff was very helpful in setting up our equipment for a slide show as well as providing equipment for us to play our own music at the event. servers were polite and accomodating to any of the guests requests. and the facility is beautiful. they even let me go super early in the morning being the type A personality i am to decorate myself and set things up. overall wonderful experience with this resort and its staff. would love to host another event here in the future. thanks, scottsdale plaza resort!"
2,"This joins my long list of places that I really want to love, but ... I love the atmosphere. I love what they SAY they stand for. I love the concept of two hippies dropping out and dropping back in as restaurateurs. What I dont love is the food. The chicken and fish tacos I had were bland. No flavoriing. Thank god they had hot sauce (not homemade, store bought) on the table to spice things up a bit. On a positive note, the prives were good and the salsa they serve with store-bought chips wasnt bad. And the lemonade (they were out of most flavors both times I visited) was good.  But overall, maybe its time for the hippies to clean up their act. Worry about the food a little more than the message."
5,"love the food and the services ,but you neesd to weight at 350ib to eat the burgers for free, the burgers are big and jucey"
3,"Clean, bright and quick. I came here with my husband, and we both had a combo-platter that included one masala dhosa, an idli, and some sambar. It was all tasty -- and waaayyy too much food. I guess its a mixed bag because some of his friends (they all work nearby) come here multiple times a week for lunch, and others swear its awful.  As for me, I like the chutney bar - its nice to be able to get as much as you want, and I recommend both the coconut chutney and the mint chutney -- or, blend them together, like my mother-in-law does with her homemade kind. Yummy. I think this place is quite tasty, but I wont come here often, just due to the fact that its a major carb overload, and I wish the dhosas werent quite so expensive (I think theyre about $7.50 for one?). But, that being said, its great for a once-in-awhile-treat."
5,Great food their pork is awesome !!!!  The slow cooking made this dish superb.   Of course the margaritas are as good as they get! Overall everyones food was tasty and the service was great.  The place was very busy with allot of energy.
4,I have eaten here twice now and this place is phenomenal!  Great price and amazing food.  I highly recommend the baked ziti!  I will go back at least twice a month.
1,"The only reason 1 star can be given is the flavor choices and taste.  The SMALLEST wings I have ever seen, they must be off of baby chicks.  I thought it was getting punked, actually LOL.  Never to be back"
4,"Totally a locals hangout. This very unpretentious wine bar is a favorite.  The owner, Darlene, has a great selection of wines from smaller labels for you to try.  If youre not sure what to get theyll help you find a bottle in your price range.  Theyve got the cheap stuff all the way to the $80+ range (if you feel like spending some money). You can buy a bottle at retail, open it up at their bar and enjoy it with a nosh.  Lots of smaller appetizers (cheese and crackers, etc).  Or, order by the glass/flight from their bar. Checkout their website before you go.  Or if you live in the area, subscribe to their email newsletter.  There is something different going on every day (live music, tastings, specials, etc.)"
4,Went to Blanco for our 3rd restaurant week meal. Been here before and its great.  the hostess really was having a bad night and just needed to go home. Not one smile or even a hello. When we walked in just a blank stare. Great! (sarcasm)  Food and service were otherwise really good.   I had the green chile pork enchiladas and I love a good tomatillo sauce. The tres de leche cake was also wonderful!  Its kind of loud place and we got to hear the conversation about blow jobs from the table next to us.
5,"Postinos on the East side!? Whoa, you like to think that youre immune to Postinos, oh yeah Its closer to the truth to say I cant get enough  You know Im gonna have to face it, Im addicted to Postinos  Thanks Robert Palmer and lets just say I wouldnt be surprised to see the fashion models around here.  Very attractive crowd!  I am honor just to be here!   Another bottle of wine and youll be mine, a one track mind  I cant be saved  4 flavors of Bruschetta is all I crave  If theres some left for you  and dont mind if I do  I might as well face it Im addicted to Postinos Ive always enjoyed attending Postinos on the West side of town, but the East side adds a new flavor.  The place still has a great deal on Monday and Tuesday nights.  Bottle of wine plus a large plate of bruschettas for $20!  The ambience is always chill and low lighting.  Quite romantic and add some pretty ladies and Im golden here!  Service is always great at Postinos.  The staff is definitely well train in the knowledge of wine and their service is spectacular! - Enjoy!"
4,"Brackins is my new favorite day drinking spot.  The bar itself is located perfectly within a tucked-away area in the Old Town Scottsdale mall area.  The atmosphere is very relaxed, and when the owners swing by, they really make an effort to get to know you.  Prices are also very relaxed, with bottled beer landing right around $3 for domestics.  All in all, if you are looking for a spot to hang out with a couple drinks, maybe enjoy some live music, and do some people watching; I would definitely recommend Brackins."
4,"Went there for the first time today.  Excellent burger, and all the extras on the burger are free which is pretty nice.  It was just over 10 bucks for a cheeseburger, regular fries, and large drink. The food was excellent.  I ding it down to 4 stars though, just because anything this good has to be unhealthy, and its definitely greasy.   The grease from the fries saturday my brown paper take-out bag.  They also squished the top of my bun pretty bad when wrapping it up in tin foil.  Im guessing if you eat there, you dont have this problem as much.  Still, 4 stars for an excellent burger and fries place.  Definitely a step up over In-N-Out."
3,"My gang usually stumble in her at some point during our nights out and about in Old Town.  They have a decent selection of beers on tap and there are usually a couple tables open if you want to sit down. Its a bar, not a club, so dont expect much.  They have servers that are polite and prompt and the wait at the bar isnt usually very long.   Worth a stop to support a local biz."
5,"Best UNIQUE breakfast / brunch / lunch spot.  This tiny place may look like a boring little bakery, but think again!   SIt outside on the small patio area, ck out the GR8 crepes! savory, breakfasty, sweet - u pick or choose!  Hubby luvs lox & cream cheese & capers.   I luv the chicken, aspargus, basil, feta :-)   Mmmmmmmm."
4,"I cant speak for the Vet portion, dog training or any other service, except the grooming dept. I take my dog in there during the Winter to get groomed, shampooed and nails clipped, because sometimes its too cold out to dry him off.  The girls in the Grooming dept. are very nice and accomodating.  They treat my dog well, and always have nice compliments about him. T They also do an excellent job and his nails are always done right.  Ive taken him elsewhere ONCE and they trimmed his nails down so much, that it hurt him to jump.  I thought he had an arthritic condition, when I realized that he had his nails done, and sure enough, he bounced back a week later. These girls know what theyre doing, and a couple of them have been there for a few years, as I recognize at least one or 2 of them every time I go in. Even to shop. Thanks ladies!"
1,"Sorry Banana Leaf... Im usually not picky at all but the Thai Curry Tofu and Vegetable dish I picked up last night was awful.  Really... it was almost not edible.  The packaging was not great, so it kind of spilled a bit in the bag - not a good start. Perhaps the curry is the yellow curry that Jenny R refers to in her review - maybe the chef should taste it before serving it - it was nasty! Seriously, Ive had better Asian food from the food court at the mall before! I will say, you did listen to my request to add eggplant to the dish - thank you... but if someone requests eggplant, perhaps you should make sure its cooked fully next time.  I had a bite that was barely cooked - it was crunchy.   So, needless to say - I dont think Ill be giving you another shot.  First impressions sometimes last a lifetime.  Sorry Banana Leaf!"
5,"I had the Crispy Steelhead, and it was delicious! The sweet pea risotto and roasted tomato-chanterelle ragout were a great addition. If youre looking for a great restaurant with an original menu, this is the place to go! Friendly staff and they were quick to seat us."
1,Worst enchiladas EVER and decor from a 1980s attempt at a mexican restaurant.  Taco Bell is a step up!  But if you like soupy enchiladas drowning in cheez wiz this is the place for you.
4,"So there name on Yelp is a bit behind the times as they are now Monte Vista $2.25 Cleaners..  Still, at $2.25, I find them to be the best place in the area.  You cant beat the price, and no matter what I drop off, shirts or pants to be laundered or dry cleaned, I always know it will be $2.25.  I hate places where some shirts are $1.50 and some are $4 but you dont know until you get the bill. Same day service is available for dry cleaning which comes in handy if you are like me and wait until you are out of clothes before you drop things off.."
2,"Ive known my way around Sky Harbor Airport since I was 4 years old and Terminal 1 was an actual terminal. In the time since then, their attempts to improve the airport, transportation and parking, and terminals have made it extremely confusing. Get in the wrong lane and youll end up in the parking garage, when all you wanted was to drop off someone at the Departures curb.  Terminal 2 remains the most accessible, with a parking lot located across the street and few airlines stationed there. Because only a couple airlines now use this terminal, security is a breeze. However, its the oldest terminal, smells bad (like rotten pizza) and doesnt appear clean.  Terminal 3 a little more of a hassle, although they have a parking garage attached to the terminal allowing you to enter any level through the elevator. More airlines use this terminal and its much smaller than Terminal 4, making it easier to navigate. Oh, Terminal 4. Youre so nice, new and clean. You have access to great restaurants like Flos Shanghai Cafe, Einsteins, Quiznos and more. I love Taberna del Tequila for a drink just prior to my flight inside security access (I dont like to fly, I prefer a bloody mary prior to boarding). You have tons of shops from Borders Books to local AZ tourist junk. I would like to love you, but you are just a mess. Its way to difficult to navigate your lanes to get where youre going, pick up and drop off is dangerous due to the people who pull away from the curb into lanes without looking, and security is painful- not only is there always a LONG line, but TSA agents regularly yell at people to ""pay attention!"" I dread flying out of Terminal 4 because I have to leave extra early for all the BS. There are much easier airports to navigate and use, but were stuck with Sky Harbor. I can only hope the light rail access once complete will help in making it a more user friendly airport."
4,"Tucked away on a side street off a main drag, we found Mosaic. Surprisingly fancy and expensive, with an elegant feel, almost like its your parents kind of dining experience. Loved the different options for the tasting menus. Focus on seafood and meats. My husband loved the What the Foie?? appetizer which had excellent presentation. My sea scallop appetizer had a monstrous scallop that could have easily fed a family of four. Feeling fishy that night, my better halfs halibut was surprisingly salty with a heavy sauce. My steak was good, but nothing special..in fact I was disappointed Id gotten it. Extensive wine selection, Dutch cheese plate and chocolate hazelnut custard for dessert.  Overall, a pleasurable meal with wonferul service and presentation, but for the price, they could really up the quality of the food. We had a dinner elsewhere a few nights later for the same cost that was much tastier from a food perspective."
4,"Their happy hour is crazy cheap!!! The scene though is like a poor mans Rehab/Wet Republic, but Im not mad! It gets really crackin there especially on the weekends (suffice to say, I was only there for a weekend hahaha). This is definitely a spot to checkout while in Scottsdale!"
2,"Are you serious? $4.50 for domestic beers during the usual ""happy hour"" time? That includes Old Style (we were there for the Cub game)!! At grocery stores you can get a 6-pack of Old Style for $4.50! And charging $5.50 for a Corona?! Cra-zy! ""World Famous Sliders""? These were the worst sliders ever, I think Jack and the Box sliders are better. Almost $10 for six southwestern sliders with a patty the size of a half dollar that got lost in the bun, one jalapeno, a small square of cheese, and salsa to make the bun soggy. I know they have a prime location being right outside of the ballpark and all, but does that really give them the right to charge whatever they want? They are going to make money regardless, they dont have to be greedy about it!"
5,"First, Im sorry this review is lengthy, but i really want people to understand how far a little kindness can go.  I entered Mimis Cafe at the end of possibly worst day ever. I came in looking to order food for takeout and get home to drown my sorrows in comfort food. i was directed by the hostess up front to go stand by the bakery and i would be able to order take out. i waited not 15 seconds and was greeted with a huge smile from a lovely girl named Danielle. She gave me a menu and told me to ask if i had questions and inquired if i had been there before. i looked at the menu for some time, unable to clear my mind enough to decide. She told me i was welcome to take a seat, and when i apologized for taking so long she responded with a smiley ""wheres the fire? take your time, can i get you a glass of wine while you decide?"" wine was a perfect idea! I finally ordered and sat drinking my wine. i waited, and then waited a little longer, Danielle the young girl doing take out informed me the kitchen was working as fast as they could but are very busy, she apologized for the wait and offered complimentary bread  and convinced me to buy a a second glass of wine. When she brought me the second glass i had just gotten off the phone and was visibly shaken with more bad news. Somehow this young girl had the courage to ask if everything was alright and what she could do to help. It was just the olive branch i needed. Just the inquiry was enough to make me feel better. i told her i was fine and thanked her for her compassion. finally my food was ready. She boxed everything with care for the drive home. All this time smiling. i couldnt help but notice Danielle interact with the other employees they always laughed or high fived her with each exchange. She had brightened my day, and it was clear she is a light for others in Mimis Cafe. This is the kicker...my bill was $30 and some change...i gave her what i thought was two $20 dollar bills, but in reality was a $50 and a $20. The young girl ran outside and stopped me saying sir, Im not sure these bills are right. i was overwhelmed by her honesty and told her no, i thought they were two 20s but the difference would be her reward for honesty. The food was tasty and just what i needed. Mimis Cafe is a friendly place worth the wait for food or a table, and if Mimis Cafe reads these reviews know that you have a superstar in Danielle."
5,"Hands down, the best pizza in the East Valley!!!! Tastes like Im back in New York City, thats how good the pizza is! They do all sorts of combinations and toppings. Mmmm mmmm good. The hero sandwiches and wings are good too. Located in a strip mall next to AMC movie theaters, its a great place to go before or after the movies. And they deliver, too. Much better quality than chain pizzerias."
4,"Margies just opened about two months ago. I stumbled upon it while looking for the Eba Cafe. This little place is open Monday-Saturday, 5:30am to 2:30pm. It is a great stopping point for commuters looking to get a coffee or breakfast bagel pick-me-up, check some email (theyve got FREE WIRELESS!) and head into or out of Tempe. I ordered a simple coffee and the egg-and-cheese toasted on an everything bagel. Tasty and a truly satisfying treat without a ding to the wallet. The place is very clean, soft comfy couches near bright windows, and Margie is just delightful. Great place to chat and concentrate away from the main throws of other well-worn coffee houses. Expect to find me there often--mainly because I want to keep this coffee house close, alive and well!"
2,"Walgreens has the best nuts. However, they recently changed their prices and only give a cheaper, 2-for on the halves and pieces. And they upped the price (again) on the whole cashews.  I will be shopping elsewhere."
1,"Is it illegal to have good Chinese good in Arizona?  We went tonight having high hopes of having high quality, fresh Chinese food and we were sorely disappointed.:( We opened our take out bag and the white rice had been left off of the order...we were going to give them a pass for that...but on the flavor issue...there are no excuses... The Peeking Dumplings were wilted and flavorless.  The sauce that went with them could not revive them.  The Chinese mustard was in little packets and had no heat...Viagra needed:(! The Mongolian Beef was so salty it tasted processed. The snap peas were stringy and overcooked. The General Chows Chicken...it tasted old like it was off an all you can eat buffet. Honestly...Panda Express is better...as least you know what to expect in a mall food court. It wasnt cheap...and Im not a food volume person but the portions were small...I was fine with it because who would want more of this plate of shame! I hope they can get there act together...but I fear the owner may be in over his head... Isnt there a Chinese Chef in town who needs  a job!"
4,"Lots of awesome packed in a cute little restaurant. Visited here on numerous occasions and never had to wait for a table. Service is excellent; friendly, and witty waitresses are a breath of fresh air. As is the patio, which is a perfect venue to enjoy a meal next to the fountains. The view of the gardens at lunch time is also a nice tidbit.  Loved the chips too. Chimichanga is A-okay!"
5,"Grew up in San Antonio and Austin. Have traveled extensively and sampled BBQ all over the country. The term Texas-style means beef, first. Period. And good smoke, and that aint mesquite. Oak is king. These guys have changed the face of Phoenician BBQ forever. Its a shame that the Scottsdale location was touched by ... well, Scottsdale. Friggin morons. If you have not been here, you need to go down to 24th and E. Roeser and try it. Hands down the best Q in the area, including Cave Creek. The guys are FROM Texas and they know the whats, wheres and hows of Bar-B-Que.  And for those ""the meal in a carton on butcher paper"" snobs who think that such is declasse, please, do me a favor... Head on down to Austin or, better yet, Lockhart. Stand at the front of the line at Stubbs or Blacks or Kruez Market and loudly proclaim your thoughts as a BBQ aficionado. Just let me know when you are heading down so I can hang out and watch the ensuing festivities. Freud said it best: BBQ and being horrifically anally-retentive is ALL about your unfulfilled dreams of your Auntie Ma. Or, shut up and grow up ya infantile gomers..."
4,"Innovative venue. Bleacher seating in the back is a bit odd, but it works. Dig the long bar at the far end of the hall. Excellent sound. Havent tried the food yet, but I intend to investigate."
4,Tasty standard bar food. Great bar service. Sweet servers (90% of the time). Huge awesome patio. The cherry on top is that it is NOT on mill ave! Best spot to be at on a beautiful spring afternoon in Arizona. What else could you possibly need?
4,"This is a good place to go when youre hungry, but dont want the ""blah"" weighed-down yucky, greasy feeling.  I always order the greek pita, well, because Im a feta fan! Yes, a large amount of the menu has feta, so if you dont like it, you may want to rethink coming here.  The rice pilaf is delicious, I also love the fruit bowls (not a fan of the pasta salad).  Chicken salad is good, but I think it needs some salt & pepper personally. Yayas chocolate cake is really yummy! All in all, I enjoy this place!"
3,"Came here for lunch recently with active Yelper and friend Brett B. Im sure hell post up his own review of the place. This is the kind of place you walk up to the register and place your order, then take a plastic number to your table and the server brings you your food. You also get your glass and go fill er up at the fountain yourself. I wasnt sure what to expect, but felt good vibes the minute I asked ""how big is the salad"" and the guy at the register walked into the kitchen to bring me a dish to show me. That was nice and above my expectation, as most places the servers will make a ""size"" with their hands and shrug and say, ""i dont know... about like this?"" So, yeah. I like that this guy actually showed me a plate and made a ""mound"" with his hand to show me some kind of size of the salad.  When I ordered ""just water"" he went to give me a plastic cup with a lid, and then said, ""you know what? Just take a regular glass, its more comfortable...."" He trusted me not to fill up my glass with anything but water (and I did only drink water). That was nice, and made me feel like an adult. Not like at some places (much cheaper than this place) that give you a plastic cup like the ones you pee in at the doctors office, when you order water. I really enjoyed my lunch here - Had a chicken caesar salad (one of my favorite things to order pretty much anywhere i go because Ill never make it at home), along with a cheese pizza. The caesar salad - for those who have a love affair with this meal - was ""perfect"" . The portion was generous, and it was chopped and tossed. The chicken was shredded and mixed in with the salad, which makes SUCH a difference in getting an even distribution, and reducing pain-in-the-ass-ness of having to cut up a chicken breast atop a salad with oversized utensils like at so many other places. It was perfectly dressed too - not too heavy, just right. And the parmesan cheese was shaved over it, rather than shredded or grated. Nice touch. Excellent flavor, every mouthful. The cheese pizza was a cripsy, ultra thin crust, delicious red sauce (kinda sweet, in a good way), and the cheeses were mozzarella and fontina - the saltiness mixed really well with the sweetness of the sauce and made this simple pizza taste extraordinary. Granted, having had some beyond-extraordinary pizza in new york, Im spoiled and have to say it was not as good as my favorite thin crust pizza from Totonnos in NYCs upper east side. But still, darn good. Id eat it again. (I took some home and it didnt look like it heated up well later on when my husband was having it). Brett had the tomato, gorgonzola, chicken, salad on mixed greens. I think it had pine nuts too. I got to taste it and it was even more flavorful than mine. Either one of these would be an excellent choice for those of you who like to order salads. Delicious.  And the service was great! The  manager even came by our tables to refill our glasses for us, though the drinks were self-serve from a fountain. the place was not busy when we got there, but it picked up as we were finishing our meals.  Great food - great service - great vibe. I hope this place sticks around.  Definitely would eat there again. Looking forward to it, even!"
5,"Great subs, the Club Supreme mikes style was really good"
1,Very nice location but food was awful.  Had a chicken salad yuck.  Service stunk big time!
4,"Im not a sushi expert by any stretch, but suffice to say that the rolls here are well-priced, fresh-tasting, and overall pretty damn delicious, with good presentation.  Im not a fan of their tea, but thats just a personal preference, I think. I enjoy the Las Vegas, but the Spank Me roll was really good as well. We usually mix and match our way around, and right now theyre running a ""happy day"" 4pm-9pm special on a lot of their rolls which makes them cheaper by $1-$3, each. Definitely worth it. Good service, laid back vibe, even if the decor is a little ""college dorm"" with the lighting, but overall, fun, good food, and affordable."
4,"As a visitor to Scottsdale, I thought a stroll through the farmers market was a great way to get a taste of the local flavor--literally. And it was! Theres a great mix of vendors, who sell everything from baked goods to coffee, from vegan wraps to preserves. There are also some interesting services like pet massages! Like Vicky T. said, it was surprising to see dogs with their owners wandering through the farmers market, because thats against code in California. But I thought it was great, and with the pet masseuse and a doggy and kitty treat vendor, it totally made sense. Farm Sessions, where local chefs give cooking demos with produce from the market, is a great idea Id like to see at my local farmers market. It did seem odd, though, that all the produce at the market was in one corner. It was the shadiest spot, so maybe thats why? Anyway, this was a great way to spend a Saturday morning and was very relaxing compared to my local farmers markets, where I often feel like I need to start throwing some elbows to get through the crowd."
4,"I stumbled in here craving breakfast because it was very close to the airport and very close to the Aloft hotel I was staying at.  Yes, I am a tourist and yes, I am from a part of the US where cowboys are not common, so walking into a place full of country western paraphanalia made me smile.  The service was good, the food was delicious, and I walked out with a few good photos.  The coffee was a tad bit weak, but Im a starbucks bold drinker, so I dont hold it against them."
4,"Let me preface this review by saying that for the past 2 years I have lived in Boston, which has some decent Chinese restaurants, great food, but rude/curt/abrupt service. I had learned to keep my head down, not make eye contact and not ask any questions. Eat as fast as possible and get the hell out before someone starts yelling at you! So understandably my guard was up when I entered Mu Shu Asian Grill. However, complete opposite here. Mr Mu Shu welcomed me to his establishment, asked me if I had ever been here before and took the time to explain the stir fry/salad bar station. I was in the mood for Mu Shu, and a place named Mu Shu must have great Mu Shu, right? Mr MS described to me his version of MS, I heard him say something about a burrito, but I really wasnt paying too much attention as I smugly thought I knew everything there was to know about Mu Shu! Boy was I wrong! When I get it, its bigger than my forearm. Its packed full of shrimp, veggies and fried rice. Wow, what a great flavour! Youve heard of Asian fusion? This is Mexasian!"
3,"This is a huge improvement over the last bar that occupied this spot. They obviously put a few bucks into the renovation and added pool tables. The rub is that when a band is playing here it totally dominates the conversation, and if the band sucks...   Please put in a smoking-friendly patio, right now customers have to stand by the parking lot sans drink! They have another less-noisy bar in the front, which I was pleased to discover was offering $1 well drinks from 9-10pm for guys -  we took full advantage."
5,"I had my brows done one month ago.  Heather did an amazing job!  I went back after 2 weeks for a ""no charge"" touch up.  I havent worn brow powder or pencil since, and most importantly my brows look TOTALLY natural.  I give her 5 stars and would strongly recommend her.  As a matter of fact I am going to go back and have my lips done!"
3,"Alright, Im not really sure I can give this place a fair assessment based on food.  I came here last week and ordered the Lox and Bagels.  So the plate came out to me and it consisted of Bagel (Im going to go on a limb and say they are not made in house) cream cheese, a pre-made product, Lox, a pre-made product (although damn good Lox) capers, pre-made product, sliced tomatoes, and sliced red onions.  So basically all they had to do is toast my bagel, and slice the onion and tomato and then just plate.  Nothing revolutionary here.  So this is why I cant really give Tryst a fair assessment.  I would have to go back and actually order something that was cooked.  It was a cute little place and has a lot of potential considering where it is located.  I have to go back again and update this review."
5,"Vitality Health and Fitness is a small gym that offers personal fitness, group fitness and fitness classes. The classes and the training programs are all varied, challenging, unique and fun. The members are positive, full of smiles and easy-going. The gym is not intimidating at all, the trainers are kind and build programs that suit your personal fitness levels, and the cost is VERY reasonable.   My husband and I have been working out with Megan, and shes a doll.  We havent gone for very long so well keep you posted on the impending RESULTS! Vitality also offers nutrition and massage -- which we both plan on checking out!  The owner is delightful and easy to work with. If you have any questions or concerns about your costs or the way you are being treated, she works WITH you to ensure you are getting the level of service that you expect and that the club/program can provide. The owner is honest and respectful, fair and reasonable. I think everyone should contact this club and see if it might work for them - you wont be disappointed!"
2,"Tried this for the first time today.  While my hubbies french toast was wonderful and the kiddos enjoyed their meal, my biscuits and gravy tasted much like bacon grease and flour.  Sending it back and trying something else is what I would have liked to do, but the server never returned to check on us until my family was finished with their meal.  The owner did apologize and asked us to give them a try again.  Maybe I will, if the staff gets some training.  Everyone seemed completely overwhelmed.  Its too bad~as I love going out for breakfast."
3,"Seriously the best 3am quesadilla I have ever had.  It was big and gooey, with just enough browning on the outside of the tortilla to make it a little bit crisp.  As an added bonus it was kind of cold outside, so it made a great hand warmer as well.  Why only 3 stars?  OK, you do have to sit on some questionable outside picnic tables and I dont want to think about how clean the kitchen may or may not be, but the entertainment value of watching tipsy people stumble around while waiting for their food cant be beat."
1,"Thank you to Sarah L for bringing to my attention that the lunch menu from which I got my information about the $34 crab cake entree was for the NYC location. However, I did note that the crab cake appetizer at the Scottsdale location  - presumably a smaller portion than the lunch entree - is $16. Yes, yes. It is Barneys and I understand the premium pricing. What I question is how Freds scored only $$. I often eat out with those on a tighter foodie budget than mine; the $$ is misleading, when Oreganos is also $$. Just sayin."
2,"Food was ok. Servers ok but cashier was horrible! Ok, some people are just not meant to work in the food industry. At least smile!  Place had a very gross smell! At first we thought maybe because we were sitting kinda close to the restrooms but the farther we moved from there the worst the smell got!  Maybe if Im desperate enough I will go back!"
4,"I was quite pleased when I visited Quick N Clean today. I opted for the $6 wash-- though now I cant quite remember what was included in said wash. I felt like it could have been a little bit more thorough in the rinse/dry section, as there was a trail of dirt coming off the back of my car. HOWEVER-- be not dissuaded by the dirt on my bumper (as I wiped it off, and the rest of the car looked great) because the vacuums at this place? OH MY GOSH! I have never been to this kind of car wash and experienced such suction. They were also an ideal shape for getting into the tight spaces underneath my seats.  Word to the wise: when you go to remove the hoses from their little canisters, pull with force. I stood there for a couple of moments as I attempted to gingerly remove it, and thought the hose was stuck. I soon realized that I looked like an idiot, and just gave the vacuum a tug, and it came right out.  Overall, I definitely say thumbs up. I had been hoping for a little rag to wipe out the interior, but am not sure if the rag was part of one of the other packages, so I will investigate again, and let you know."
4,"This was my 1st spring Training baseball experience so I cant compare the ballpark with any other.  However, as a newbie I can say that I appreciate the intimate setting. Every seat is a decent seat. Hubs and I had seat right behind home plate for less than $30. Its a really chill atmosphere. Feels like a college ball park. The concessions are priced fairly. The bathrooms were clean.  I had a great time.  See you next year!"
4,Great place to grab some quick mexifood. Service at this location has been great. Fast and efficent. Try the pick two for a healthier smaller portions!
5,"Great selection of gelato! Friendly welcoming staff. Reasonably priced, deliciously rich gelato!"
5,"Im not a fan of chains. I far prefer to find, and give my business to, new and interesting local fare. That said, there are a couple of chains I like and one is Texas Roadhouse. Texas Roadhouse does two things really well: steak and portions. I can go to a Texas Roadhouse anywhere and get a well-made ribeye at a very reasonable price. It made not be ""fork tender"" or the same quality as a $50 ribeye, but itll only cost me $18 and I know it will be far superior to any other, more expensive, chain steakhouse. But before I get that steak, Ill get peanuts, bread, salad, and sides. So Ill likely have half a steak for lunch the next day. Like I said, well made steak and portions. Im good with that."
3,"Whew!  What a hike.  Coming from Colorado, though, the relative comparison makes it just a 3.   Firstly, its definitely treacherous.  When we arrived between 730 and 8 on a Saturday morning, there were about four, maybe five firetrucks in the parking area...these rescue/aid teams just camp out there, I think, because of all the doofuses who dont plan accordingly waterwise or overestimate their ability to make this climb.  Also, two different areas of the Echo Canyon trail are especially steep and potentially slick, so theyve installed some metal railings to help you along there...but only if youve got some gloves or if the temperature is moderate (uhhhh,...that doesnt really happen in Phoenix during the day in summer), because those damn things get hot enough to fry an egg.  Also - water, water, water.  Bring a LOT, or top off at the start of the trail before you go up (though the water out of that tap attached to the water fountain is about 85 degrees, yuk).  It was a fun jaunt.  The view was worth it - not entirely picturesque as far as nature goes, but it was nice view of the city and surrounding area.  If you go, just be wary of the sun/heat, and know that youll be clambering over and around boulders and such.  (If you trip, its CURTAINS!)"
4,Great Happy Hour ! Great Food ! I work in the building and many of us wish they opened for lunch.
3,"Two and a half stars, really.  This place is really quite strange. Video coffee bar? I dont have much to compare it to, I guess. Well start with the coffee: traditional espresso macchiato. No microfoam, large bubbles in the milk, too hot to drink right away. The shot was good, but by the time it was cool enough to drink had lost quite a bit of flavor. Very friendly service, on the other hand. Given that Phoenix-foam tends to be subpar, I tend to think that service and atmosphere are almost more viable measures for successful coffeeshops than coffee. (in Phoenix)  The actual place was pretty odd. Large paintings of Mexican sugar skulls in the back, nice chairs and tables, an orange faux-finish on the walls... And then the video bar element. Three huge flatscreens on the wall playing pop music videos from the 90s. Very strange, in my opinion. Im not sure that Cher and Madonna really mesh with coffee shop, but I guess theyre trying something new.  I had a nice time lounging and it was relatively quiet with regularly good lighting."
4,"Basicly i would let anyone know i like it, never heard a wiper of a bad experience here.   Def a fan, i work very close by and if i really need they would deliver, yeah their that nice.   How can i put it Ladybug House of Sandwiches or Sandwich shop for short what a great place in phoenix to take care of the lunch fill with out going to Subway, (not saying i dont go there).   When I need a real sandwich I stop in here.   They are a lunch spot so they close early and will have specail summer time hours.   Why ladybug house of sandwiches well, great meats choice of differnt breads and its like what I love the ladybug theme.  and just what you think of ladybugs their nice not pests, pretty and would make a cool friend.   Small note, i put my business card in their bowl once and actually won!  I got half off for the whole office, thanks ladybug ladies your the best.   Once again Kevin, lets you know whats real, kind of like me McDowell right accross from the Banner Hospital  right smack in the middle of the whole campus of medical buildings and offices."
2,"Ive been to Buffalo Wild Wings before, but my first visit at this location was during UFC 117. If you come here to watch fighting events like UFC I would recommend arriving 2 hours before the main card starts if you want a seat inside. I arrived an hour before the PPV portion of the fight started and didnt get a seat until half an hour in and it was outside. I ordered 12 regular wings and I was very underwhelmed. I felt the wings were overpriced because they are smaller than average. The main reason why I went here was that they werent charging a cover or bill minimum for the fight. Also, the atmosphere for a UFC fight was really good compared to the other BWW I went to in Tucson. If you want a place with a good atmosphere for a sporting event, you should come to BWW. But your food expectations should be lowered a lot."
3,"I admit Im not a huge BBQ fan, as it usually makes me feel like exploding afterwards but since my dining partner loves BBQ, weve eaten here a lot. The meat is pretty good but at least one of the meats has been dry each time Ive been. My favorite has been the ham. The spicy BBQ sauce is pretty darn tasty too.  Ive found myself putting black pepper on the mac and cheese to spice it up and havent been all that impressed with the rest of their sides either. Im a big fan of sides at BBQ places, even more than the meat, so when sides disappoint I get sad. :( I dumped out their homemade root beer after one sip. Dont know what was about it but it was very *off for me, and I seriously love root beer. My dining partner loved it so ehhh...maybe its just me.  The place is very interesting on the inside, the decor reminds me of a mid century cafeteria but more modern. They have a huge hand painted mural of a farm and a large outdoor seating area for parents to let their kids run around in while they eat.  Joes gets packed. Ive seen the line wrap around to the outside on the weekends. I dont think its worth waiting the 20-30 minutes in line for, but then again I dont think a lot of places are worth that wait for cafeteria style dining."
5,"Truly a great owner who cares about his customers!   I highly recommend a visit if you like one of a kind, quality pieces....young, yet classic, tasteful, yet funky.   """
5,"They have anything from salads, pitas, wraps, burgers, and wood fired pizzas.  Although this isnt a 100% plant-based restaurant they pride themselves on having many vegan options.  Not only are there options, but upon visiting their site I found a table of what items are vegan, what arent, and what makes them non-vegan (which is always nice to know). Great to have so many vegan options that are spelled out on their website.   We expected a counter-service experience but were pleasantly surprised when we entered to find it was an actual sit-down restaurant.  The vibe was a classy yet laid back, youthful feel.  Most of the servers were high school or college age and wore regular street clothes (think Urban Outfitters style).  I loved the laid back atmosphere of the servers even though its a sit-down experience and really enjoyed the color scheme and tin plated ceiling. The food was absolutely FANTASTIC.  Oh my. For an appetizer we selected the garlic dip with two pitas.  The garlic dip is a mix of olive oil, lemon juice, fresh garlic, and smashed potatoes.  If you love garlic, youll love this. My husband chose the Falafel Pita which was topped with cilantro and spices, mixed greens, tomatoes, onions, pickles and tahini.  He was very happy with his choice, although next time hed ask for no onions. I went with the Veggie Garden Wrap that included zucchini, broccoli, cauliflower, eggplant, yellow squash, carrots, onions, tomatoes, brown rice, mixed beans, ginger, herbs and garlic. One thing we quickly found was that our entrees were HUGE.  This is not a complaint in anyway.  However, next go around we may share an entree.  Either way, this visit, we had leftovers to take home for lunch the next day.  Will definitely return."
2,"Yikes.  The only reason this place gets 2 stars instead of 1 is because I think their Baja chicken burrito is super tasty &  their Mango Salsa. Cons: The place is dirty (dont take my word, read the other reviews) The employees are always bullshitting until they rudely ask you what you want to order. The employees never offer suggestions, which may be an English Language barrier. The front door handle was broken my last time I went in here. Unreal. The burritos are likley to squirt and get extremely messy on the last few bites....sick.  Dont eat in the car unless you have a blanket in your lap, gross.  If Im craving a burrito, I will likely just go to the Chipotle across the street and wait in line for 15 mins VS this place....I think the only way Ill come back to this location is strait up steal their salsa and limes from their salsa bar. This place would be better if they got friendlier harder working employees that actually cleaned the place up a bit."
4,"Extremely friendly staff, very comfortable decor, and delicious food!  I enjoyed a sampling of a few different mezes and a greek salad - just wonderful!"
4,Because sometimes you just want to flip the bird at calorie counting and healthy living.  This valley landmark is the place for satisfying that once in awhile sinful urge to screw up your carefully laid out dietary plans.
4,"We arrived at the store several months ago to create a wedding registry, which was an okay experience.  A ""registry expert"" sat us down and went over the basics, and then wanted to walk us through everything we may need on our list.  We werent interested because were already home owners and just needed some entertaining extras and a few other items.  Luckily, after awhile she got the hint and left us alone.   Anywho.  Gifts began to arrive and were shipped directly to us, big plus.  Then came the true test.....returns.  Easy as pie!  No problems!  I even wanted to exchange some items for a Kitchen Aide mixer (which every domestic woman needs!), and forgot my 20% off coupon.  Oops.  Luckily, the cashier found one and let me use it - which saved me $80 bucks.   Everyone I encountered was helpful, the only downside is that its a little unorganized and seems crowded with merchandise.  Anytime I am in need of a kitchen items, Ill grab my 20% off coupon and return!"
4,"Nice crispy crust.  Came here the other night and ordered a pie at the bar, with a couple of beers.  Definitely  an Old Town Scottsdale institution.  Their calzone looked pretty good, and enough for two people, unless you were the 135 lb guy sitting next to me, that scarfed down the whole thing himself.  I mean if he ate it all, it had to be good.  They also have some pretty good local beers on tap and by the bottle.   Ill definitely add this  my repertoire of AZ pizza haunts."
4,The only place I go for a nice lunch on Mill. Two words: Beet Salad. Thank me later.
4,"Great soup at a great price. I go for the veggie soup normally, since Im a bit leery of the raw meats and strange meatballs you can get.  Their vermicelli is also quite edible. Service could be a little quicker. Bring cash if youre spending less than $5 - with pho and water you will pay 3.50 + tax.  Cheapest lunch in town."
5,"My husband called me from work one day after a coworker had brought in several dozen bosa donuts and he said, ""Ive just had the best donuts Ive ever eaten"". Me, being a pastry lover, had to give it a try. We went early one morning and got one of every donut they had, they were awesome! The place is a little hole in the wall and had I not been told to go, I probably would have never gone in. The donuts were soft and fresh, the cinnamon crumble one was my favorite, and they were also reasonably priced. We live in ahwatukee so its a little out of our way, but we will definitely be coming here again!"
4,"Though a couple of hiccups couldve ruined the night, Roaring Fork took great care of my boyfriend and me and the food was delicious to boot (ha, boot. Get it? cuz its western? Never mind). We were surprised at how busy they were on a Tuesday night, but we were able to snag a table on their beautiful covered patio. The atmosphere was nice, and i was surprised at the range of patrons (a family of 5 with 3 fairly young children at one table, and a 10-top of blue hairs right next to us). Our server Charlie was very nice and helpful when it came to selections (from wine to food). We are trying out places in prep for a family visit, so we want to make sure we get a good sapling of the menu. We ordered a bottle of sauv blanc, and though the wine was delicious, it took about the half the meal for Charlie to bring out the marble chiller. Thankfully the wine started out pretty cold, so no harm no foul. I orderd a bowl of tortilla soup (one of my faves) and I was impressed witht he presentation and taste. The bring the bowl with the chicken and tortilla strips out then pour the broth from a pot right at your table. Helps keep the tortilla strips crisp and was a great presentation. The soup was delicious, though a little creamier than i normally like my tortilla soup. We also ordered the seared ahi with guac and THAT was amazing. The pepitas crackers were delicious and interesting and the ahi was perfect. Great app for sure. Plus, the bread and butter were super delicious too. Garlic biscuits, mini corn bread and pepper butter? so good! For entrees the boyfriend ordered the bacon wrapped pork loin over grits and I ordered the signature Dr. Pepper BBQ Baby Back Ribs. We subbed fries for asparagus and green beans and ordered an extra side of their green chile mac and cheese. I know, a lot of food, but we planned on taking most of it home. Heres where it got interesting. Or should I say, boring.  So far everything (except the chiller) had been delivered timely and was tasty. But when we realized wed been waiting 30 mintues or so for our entrees to come (after theyd taken away our apps), it started to get a little annoying. After about 40-45 mintues, the manager came over and leet us know our tray of food had been dropped and had to be re-made. No problem! I understand accidents happen. But i think it wouldve done a lot to smooth us over if theyd told us right away the spill had happened rather than waiting until we were about eat the burger off the table next to us. RF did recognize the inconvenience though and completely took care of us when the bill came. So props to them for that, and we didnt even complain or ask for any special treatment. When the food finally arrived, the ribs were OUTSTANDING. the sauce was perfect, not to sweet, not to flat. And the meat was literally falling off the bone. The veggies were all good, but the really show-stopper was the mac and cheese. The crumble top was delicious and the cheese was melted and runny but not stringy or clumpy. Spicy from the green chiles but perfectly reasonable. I want another kettle of them right now. So good. The boyfriends dinner was also good, but i think my ribs and the mac and cheese were really the best part. We boxed everything up and ordered the huckleberry bread pudding to go. I was disappointed they no longer do the pineapple upside down cake, which so many yelpers have recommended, but I loved the bread pudding as a substitute. the buttery sauce didnt reheat very well at home, but it was still very very good and the ice cream was a perfect complement. I would totally order it again. Like a muffin fresh from the oven, still a little gooey. Overall, i loved the food and the staff was really apologetic bout the ""incident"". The atmosphere is great and i would definitely come back. Next time, the burger!"
1,"We were excited to check out this new restaurant! We were left extremely underwhelmed. We sat in the bar to watch MNF. It would have been nice to be able to hear the game over the discordant pop rock music at a mexican establishment but I understand that you are not a ""sports bar"". It was Monday night and with the exception of a large group  of blue hairs celebrating secretarys day the place was empty.  The bar area managed to fill up, because the Cardinals were on tv and it seemed as thought the high tops and patio were busy as well.  Our bartender Amanda was very polite and eager to up sell us their flavored tequilas and specialty cocktails. You can tell she was a little wet behind the ears but she was doing her best nothing a little training and experience cant fix. The wait time to receive a cocktail was excruciatingly long though being a former bartender I understand the complexity that new bars go though to develop new and unique cocktails.  We ordered the pumpkin margarita. I applaud the attempt but personally it tasted like puréed baby food.  I was feeling very open minded and wanted to experience as much as I could that TQLA had to offer so we ordered the salsa trio and chicken tortilla soup.   Queso dip: cold Habanero dip: sweet with a swift kick afterwards: not bad Guacamole: good: but was gone after 2 bites. I guess they feel if they place the guacamole on a bed of green shredded lettuce it will look like there is more than delivered. Fail Chicken tortilla soup: Thick tomato soup with dry dark meat chicken chunks. Maybe it is just me but I prefer a more broth based ck tort soup and juicy white/dark meat chicken. Bleh: Amanda offered to remove it off our bill but I insisted on finishing mine because I was hungry. My GF pushed hers to the side; DNF.  Meanwhile; whilst experience our starters we managed without any silverware or napkins and at this point Amanda being the only bartender on managed to become flooded with specialty cocktails in the well; thus not being able to properly oversee her patrons at the bar. Needles to say our drinks were empty, our plates, monkey dishes, empty bowl of chips, 2 cups of bland tortilla soup, saucers and wrinkled up black beverage napkins (used in the place of the real ones) were all tattering on the edge of the bar eagerly anticipating a bus boy to remove them.  Onto the Entrees: I ordered the carne Asada steak.  My girlfriend tried the habanero chicken platter. They were delivered by TQLA manager ""Joe"". Whom decidedly pulled himself from enjoying the football game to expedite some food. He crept up behind us and shuffled the entree platters in front of our faces after we spread our dirty dishes closer to the edge of the bar and politely stacked them for our ficticious busboy/girl to remove them properly. Now in my history with management; a decent manager would offer to remove the collection of dishes but instead he decided to ask us if we needed anything else since the look on our faces was disgust. Instead we opted to inform Joe that we would enjoy our meal a little better with silverware and napkins.  He acknowledged that was a novel concept and proceeded to fetch us a pair. Joe wasnt six steps away before he was interrupted by a member of the waitstaff who informed him that what she needed was more important than delivering two setups to some first time customers so they could enjoy their ever increasingly cold food.  At this point my girlfriends temper got the best of her and she jumped up and retrieved her own silverware off of a table in front of Joe and eager waitress to salvage any heat that might have been left in our entrees.  We dig in:   Carne Asada: was tender but lacking the Wow factor.  Habanero Chicken: Tasted like a chicken breast smothered in their warm fire roasted salsa... What happened to the habaneros?  Where is the heat...? Bland I hope they get better: but until then Nandos all the way. Never saw Joe touch any tables, never offered to help out a bartender who was swimming laps in an Olympic size pool. Occasionally the wait staff would come behind the bar and help out.  This is about the time that our appetizers, chips, soups, and entrees were all removed from the bartop. FYI Joe, the hostess stand can hold itself up on its own. You dont have to stand there and hold it up. Keep an eye on your staff and customers and offer help where they need it so people will be happy to come back and give you a second shot."
4,Being from NJ I am always on the prowl for my hometown pizza and Italian food. They have absolutely the best cannolis like my grandmothers!  The pizza droops like Rays Pizza in NY. Im not a big fan of sauce that has any sugar in it which most do so to many their sauce is awesome. I prefer unsweetened everything. The service is great and they are from New Jersey!  Its a great place to grab their special 2 slices and a coke for $4! YUM!
4,"Great food, fresh crispy veggies, excellent service. I love the luau pork, but its kind of salty, even for me considering I love salty food!  Mango iced tea is very refreshing and key lime pie is gooood. I have tried the tofu but it has been hit or miss the way they cook it.I like it crispier (or as crispy as you can get tofu:)"
3,"Finally tried Sucker Punch Sallys today and I think it has promise.  They are still on the small opening menu so the lunch choices were limited but I had the pork tenderloin sandwich and must say I was impressed.  Obviously made in house and not frozen, nice sized portion and very tasty, almost like a German schnitzel.  The fries were so-so, I dont care much for fresh cut fries as they are usually limp like these were.  Will definitely give them another try for breakfast and when they get the full menu going in a few weeks.  Nice vibe and the waitress was very friendly.  If you live in the area and have been thinking about it, give them a try."
4,Great pizza   We have enjoyed this place for quite a few years.   Ingredients are above average.   Love the fresh garlic topping Tough to beat for quality pizza on the East side
4,"My first ever trip to Bass was overwhelming. Like walking into a Sportsmans Warehouse that had mated with Dicks Sporting Goods, and then gone on steroids. Bass Pro Shops is an outdoor persons dream.  And its good for the whole family, oddly enough! Once you get inside this massive place, you have an upstairs and downstairs. There is a kids area, a restaurant with fresh fish, a huge womens section and mens, and areas for fishing and boats and hunting and camping and survival and gear for any occasion. You can look at the giant fish tank, climb up a faux rock side for $3, and just be purely entertained for ages. They have snack foods and jerky and sweets. BBQ grills. Do they have guns? I dont know, probably! They have GPS equipment and water bottles and on and on and on.  It was exhausting in a great way. My camping/outdoors needs tend to be more mimimalist oriented so I prefer an REI. But I like it here a lot. I picked up some socks that have a lifetime guarantee, and a nice woolen shirt for almost nothing, and a couple of gifts for the hunter/outdoors people in my life back in Tucson. Bass: it is an experience."
4,"Love it!  It was pretty far away from my home in Glendale, but I think it was worth the trip.  We had girls night here a couple weeks ago.  We had a cute waiter, who helped us with our wine choices.  We ordered 4 different types of bruschetta and they were divine!  Will defiantly come back even though it was a little pricey It still wasnt that bad considering the quality."
4,"LOVE it here. I stay at hotels about 80 nights a year for work, and often go to Phoenix. Gotta say, if it werent for the ""hood"" neighborhood, I wouldve given it 5 stars. The restaurant next door, Bobby Q, has rave reviews, so it seems like a convenient place to eat, but that seems to be the only dinner place around. Good thing its the Residence Inn, with a small kitchenette. This is probably the cleanest hotel Ive stayed in all year. The dishes and silver wear are very clean and housekeeping keeps it that way daily. Ive stayed at places twice the amount of this Residence Inn in Scottsdale and dishes in the kitchenette were filthy.  Small workout room but you can go to the LA Fitness down the street for free.  Oh, they dont skimp on breakfast-waffles, eggs, sausage, yogurt, fresh fruit and hot and cold cereal.  Beds dont look comfy but they are Devine.  I had some of my best nights sleep here. Its nice to stay at a place that is more like a home than a hotel."
5,"I frequent RnR quite a bit for happy hour.  Ive been here tons of times since I moved to AZ.  Definetly one of the best happy hours in old town.  Happy hour from 4-7 LOVE IT (I get mad when places are 3-6- who gets off work that early??).  And pretty every drink is on special during happy hour.  Really cheap wine, beer, and liquor.   Ya their food isnt orgasm AMAZING but its pretty good.  Ive havnt disliked anything Ive tried there.   I love the atmosphere and outdoor patio on both levels. Ive been for breakfast too and the bottomless mimosas are wonderful.  They keep em coming.  The food is good breakfast food.   I take family/friends from out of town here for happy hours. I love this place I dont get what the hate is about!"
5,"Sometimes its difficult to really feel satisfied with a raw vegan diet , but every time I go to Pomegranates I leave more than satisfied.   The atmosphere is welcoming and delightful, although very busy during the lunch rush. I did have to share a table with a stranger last time I was there but the stranger turned out to be a great lunch companion.  This is a must for anyone who is considering (or already is) a raw and/or vegan diet.  Everything is so yummy you wont know it is good for you!"
5,"My go-to restaurant for very tasty, genuine Thai food. Great lunch specials.  Favorites from the dinner menu: fish cake, tom kha soup, pad thai, hot basil, Thai iced tea"
4,"I LOVE the Bacado. There is nothing better for nursing a hangover than the Good Egg.  We try to visit every few weeks. Yes, the wait for a table can be long, but its totally worth it!"
4,The food wasnt phenomenal but it was very good. The service was excellent. The decor was very cool. A good experience. Great selection of wines by the glass. Very pleasant experience.
5,"The Rosson House Museum is a restored home from the 1895s.  And its also conveniently right next to the Teeter House Tea Room and across from Pizzeria Bianco.   For under $5, you can take a guided tour of Rosson House and learn what life was like for its residents so long ago. Its a really cool activity to do, and since its close to so many great restaurants, you can go for dinner and drinks after your tour.  Walking through the home, its easy to imagine the lady of the house sipping tea in a dainty cup with her lacy gloves on.  Or maybe its just me.  Houses like this tend to creep me out. I half-expected to see a ghostly woman in a pinafore around every corner, but let me tell you, Im glad I didnt.  Either way, coming to Heritage Square and exploring the historic buildings in it is a great way to spend an afternoon."
5,"This restaurant has the best Italian food I have ever ate in my life!!! Definitely one of the best restaurants in AZ. I had the sautéed calamari for an appetizer, and an amazing dish for dinner with red snapper and pasta. Their bread also melts in your mouth. Blown away by the service. Gilda was my server, and she was amazing. Everyone was super nice, professional, courteous, and sooooooo hospitable. Ive never had service this good at a restaurant other than at Cafe Poca Cosa in Tucson. SERIOUSLY. AMAAAAAZING restaurant!!!!!"
2,"Lets put it this way...  I ordered two topping-heavy small pizzas from Naked Pizza.  I had a Groupon for $20 that only cost me $10.  So, keep in mind I am rating this on my entire experience that cost me merely $10 out of pocket. The good?  The garlic topping is delicious.  The employees were friendly.  They were generous with their toppings.     The bad? Daiya cheese is disgusting on this pizza and tasted like raw dough.  If youre off dairy, get the pizza sans cheese.  It will probably be a lot better! The just okay?  The crust was okay-tasting, if not a little plain and dry.  The sauce was pretty good for one of us and just okay for the other.   This is one of the two times in my life that I have ordered pizza and not kept the leftovers.  Of two adults and three kids eating the two small pizzas, we were left with one and a half 10"" pizzas, which we promptly tossed in the bin.  My daughter disliked this pizza so much, she picked off a few of her toppings and then told me she was full (when she said earlier how famished she was).   I am only rating this pizza two stars versus one because I can see that it would be ""better"" without the Daiya cheese that I chose to have on the pizza instead of mozzarella."
1,"My fiance and I tried the place because of a Groupon.  We live in the same neighborhood and see the place all the time but the look of the place was never enough to draw us in.  There is nothing eye catching about the business front at all.  Its in a strip mall and looks old.  At night, they turn on strands of tacky Christmas lights that only attract attention to the fact that the lights are so poorly hung. When we arrived for dinner we were greeted by an empty corridor, no host station and no host.  We could see what looked to be a bar but it wasnt a bar that Id want to eat, drink and socialize at.  To pass the time until we were finally greeted we browsed the many framed publications touting how incredible the place was.  Im already here...I dont need any more persuasion.  Its time for the Chef/owner to take down the ""look how good I was"" trophy wall and go with a more inviting modern look. We were greeted by friendly gentleman who seated us on the main lower floor.  He handed us our menus and asked if he could get us something to drink.  There is no drink menu on the menu.  No beer list, no soda list, no liquid period.  We asked to see the wine list, which had only bottle prices and doesnt even hint that they sell wine by the glass.  Once I asked if they had beer and sold wine by the glass it was like we made a breakthrough.   The menu seems a bit outdated so I  went with the Lasagna, the basics.  While we sat waiting for our meal, the salads came.  Weird...the menu didnt mention anything about a salad nor did the waiter.   More lack of information from the menu. Now on to the decor.  It is terribly outdated.  Tacky, bland, pale paint scheme, brass fixtures, mirrors and cliche wine bottles.  There were beautiful fresh flowers throughout which we really enjoyed.  I was unfortunately seated directly in front of two paintings both with a woman and a little girl drinking what appears to be wine.  Im guessing they are personal family paintings but they are horribly out of place and bordering on creepy.  I couldnt take my eyes off of them and that distracted me throughout the night.  This place needs a makeover, new modern paint scheme and some updating on the artwork. The lasagna came.  It was OK at best.  I tried my fiances chicken genevese at it was horrible.  The chicken tasted like it was boiled which is an instant dish killer for me.  We did not take our leftovers.  We asked for the check and it came with a after dinner cordial which was a nice surprise and tasted delicious.  We wont be back.  To be honest Oreganos lasagna is better by far."
