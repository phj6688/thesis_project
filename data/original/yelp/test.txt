4	We got here around midnight last Friday... the place was dead. However, they were still serving food and we enjoyed some well made pub grub. Service was friendly, quality cocktails were served, and the atmosphere is derived from an old Unos, which certainly works for a sports bar. It being located in a somewhat commercial area, I can see why its empty so late on a Friday. From what my friends tell me - this is a great spot for happy hour, and it stays relatively busy thru 10pm. *UPDATE - Great patio for day-drinking on the weekends!
5	Brought a friend from Louisiana here.  She says that the crawfish etouffee here is the best shes had outside of Louisiana!
3	Every friday, my dad and I eat here. We order the same thing... pizza wraps. they are good and fillng. iced tea hits the spot. Typical strip mall pizza.
1	My husband and I were really, really disappointed with our experience at Coulter Infiniti.  We brought our 2006 G37 with barely 34,000 miles (and out of warranty) to have the moon roof looked at.  The moon roof wouldnt open or close, but you could hear the motor working. After leaving the car there all day we get a call that the car needs a whole new moon roof track - which would cost over $3000.  We contacted their corporate office to attempt to get some or all of the cost covered, due to the fact that its a big repair and the car  is barely out of warranty.  We were flat out denied.  Twice.   We were dreading the big repair, and decided to bring the car to a different auto shop (which will get a big, fat 5 star review) for a second opinion.  Turns out the track just had a BUILD UP OF DIRT AND DEBRIS and needed to be cleaned out.  Seriously?!?!  Just over $100 later we were on our way! I find it VERY hard to believe that Coulter didnt know this was the problem.  We are now searching for a new SUV, and will not be choosing Infiniti.  How disappointing.
5	Love this place!  Was in phoenix 3 weeks for work.  Ate here 3 times.  The squid salad is amazing!  They also have sushi, bibimbap, and tons of other items.  Must try!
4	This hotel is in a good location for getting to the sports venues downtown, the convention center or to just be in the heart of the city. Granted, it is about a 7 block walk to most of those places, but the lower price and FREE parking definitely make it worthwhile. I usually stay in Scottsdale when i am here for spring training, but I was here for a conference and walked to the convention center each day with no problems. It made sense to be downtown instead of Scottsdale. The hotel is clean, the rooms are nice and big and the free breakfast is decent. I did not visit the pool, so I cannot comment on it. Someone mentioned the area being shady, i walked to and from here at least twice a day including late night and never felt it was a bad area. Also, the review about passing cars was not an issue for me. I was on the street side and Im a light sleeper. Maybe their window was open?  i do agree that you can hear your neighbors in the bathroom, slightly annoying. In, summary - this hotel is a great choice and if the need arises, Id stay again.
4	I love that this place has top seafood plates and choices. The services is hit and miss but once i went in with three friends and we sat at the sushi bar and they saw we werent getting service they grabbed our order right away. Happy hour is good and drinks arent expensive anyhow so drinkers celebrate! Cherry roll (i do it without sauce), octopus, anything with their eels, i love the quality of salmon as well. The best part is that FOOD IS SERVED TILL 2AM!!
4	Awesome if you like ramen...even awesomer if you like boba tea!!!
5	Great place for a "home office" morning. One of my favorite places - indoor & outdoor seating. Always busy - they offer breakfast & lunch, their food is awesome! Very generous portions.
1	1 star for service, but the food is not ok :( they literally put 4 pieces of chicken on my taco. I let that go & figured was a mistake. When I went again, ordered different item & same result. Little to no meat. I will not be going back.
4	Good food and able to manage a large group easily. Our party had 11 and there wasnt a long wait at all. Highlights: spinach and artichoke dip, onion rings, and tortilla soup. Total tab was only $160 for the whole group.
5	This place is great! If you talk to anybody they have a suggestion for a great flavor. You can bring in food from another place to enjoy and just enjoy a great atmosphere. With the music that someone has an issue with you can just talk to the DJ to get a suggestion they are MORE than accommodating. They have a great happy hour prices!  Overall great prices, great people, and a great time! If you have the right mind :)
3	Air Jordan! need I say more?
4	There are many other reviews which extol the virtues of this location. I just wanted to add some of my experiences as well as a few observations. First off, at the time of this writing Ive been in Phoenix for about a year. Learning about all the necessary places to go in a new town, I had the opportunity to rate businesses objectively (not like My mom always went there so I do too...) Frys became a standard go to place. Their hours are great (5 AM to 1 AM). There are many locations, and their prices are very competitive. They also have a convenient VIP card and electronic coupon program. Specifically to my needs, this location has a good pharmacy, an organic/health selection and a well stocked bakery and deli (for parties and special occasions). Their parking is reasonable and the lot is well kept/secure. Theres also a Chase branch nearby as well as a Best Buy, Staples and Old Navy. On Wednesdays theres a Farmers Market just across the street for everything else I cant find here. Not all Frys carry the same things. For instance, I can only depend on this location to carry pita bread, garlic naan, large Fage yogurt as well as the Mexican version of creme fraiche. I appreciate this greatly. One word of caution, be firm with the staff at the deli. Take a number, insist on their attention, and dont let them gyp you with small wings or the bottom of the pasta selection. I know some of them dont care about their job, but dont let that ruin your experience. Remember: theyre probably making minimum wage. Oh, and the other reviewers comment about the parking is accurate, although Im not sure what they can do about it as this is a mall complex.
5	TJ was there for me when my water heater broke and started flooding my garage.  He walked me through fixing it over the phone until he was able to send some help to my house.  Very grateful, and I will continue referring!
2	So I was pretty excited about this burger joint opening since its President Obamas favorite...  The burger was good. Not great, not bland, just okay. My biggest hang up with this restaurant are the prices! Skip the beverage... its very over priced. I was also not impressed with the fries- regular or cajun. They were pretty average as well. Stick with the burger and skip the rest is my suggestion to you.
4	I really dont consider myself a Neimans type of girl... As a matter of fact, I dont really feel comfortable in Neimans - its extremely fancy and high end for me.  But, Ive gone in a handful of times and even bought a dress or two on sale at Neimans in the past.  I admit, the quality associated with the designer labels at this store is pretty amazing. Anyways, I felt some major pressure to register at Neimans from my mom, so I met my mother-in-law-to-be at this Neimans location on Sunday.  The housewares / registry department is extremely small... and although the woman working was sweet, she botched the spelling of Jareds name in the process.  Needless to say, i was not so impressed. Fancy sums this department store up in my eyes - Im much more of a Nordstroms or Macys or Bloomingdales type of girl!
4	I have been trying to reduce my caloric intake and found out that at Red Robin you can order a "petite" burger. It is smaller but has the same toppings you order on the regular. So for those of you that dont want to have a burger that is 1000 calories (yes they are and more with the endless fries) , try the petite.
5	Great pizza and awesome must have guacamole pizza appitizer!!!!
5	This is a quaint little airport which is very convenient if you are travelling to the Tempe/Mesa area, or already know people who live there.  I say its convenient-- if you are flying in from Grand Island or Grand Forks or Rapid City or East Bugtussel, since the only commercial tenant at this decomissioned air force base is Allegiant Airlines, which specializes in flying you from nowhere to somewhere (Phoenix, Las Vegas, Orlando that sort of thing).   But from landing to sitting in my rental car it was maybe 20 minutes tops and I was heading out to lunch in the Phoenix area (dont bother with purchasing the "snacks" on the flight, just make sure you are prepared beforehand).
5	Headed back to Lobbys. How I missed this tasty burger. I wasnt disappointed with round 2. The burger was still fantastic! Im also happy that the fries were a little bit less salty than my previous trip.  With any burger purchase, getting the combo pack (fries/soda) is the smart choice. I do wish that they would lose the styrofoam soda cups and offer more than one size of drinks. Make sure to grab plenty of napkins before you sit down. The burger can make a mess with the homemade sauce dripping off the meat and bun. Thats a good thing in my opinion!
5	Simple but really great cajun food prepared in steamers right in front of you.  Selections include gumbo, pan roasts (a tomato-based broth with chunks of seafood), or seafood creole all with your choice of shrimp, crab, chicken, crawfish, oysters, or all five, with rice. They also have fresh oysters, jumbo shrimp cocktails, salads, and tasty seafood chowder, as well as the occasional lobster special. Ive been probably 20 times and still never had a bad dish. The staff is friendly and helpful, and will adjust the spiciness of the dishes to your taste. By far the best option at the Talking Stick resort. As another reviewer noted, this restaurant is really just a bar with a couple of tables, stuck right off the casino floor. This is definitely not a fine dining spot, with the clanging of slot machines and dead-eyed gamblers shuffling around fifteen feet away. Still, its definitely worth a visit to Talking Stick. At $10-12 for lunch portions and $17-19 for huge dinner servings, and $25 for a massive platter of oysters, shrimp, crab, mussels, and clams, its a fantastic value for the quality and tastiness of the food.  Good, reasonably priced seafood can be hard to come by in the valley, but this spot is a gem.
1	Staff was very rude, bowling prices werent displayed to the best of their ability, extreme bowling itself was over priced almost $20 per person. The only thing about their extreme bowling was that it was extremely hot, temperature wise. they had many ceiling fans and not one of them turned on. And the bowling equipment malfunctioned three times during our games. It was not a pleasant experience and I dont believe well be going to this facility again.
4	The staff is really helpful.  I arrived without credit card due to a travel mishap and they were great about providing assistance to get me to a bank to help clear things up.  Their bell staff is friendly and knowledgable.  They can and will get you anywhere in town.   Room was okay.  Clean, well furnished and updated.  I had a window overlooking the courtyard and I would recommend avoiding that.  It can get a little loud at night.   Banquet food was good.  Not great, but good and plentiful.  Good variety of dishes for everyone from salads and sandwiches to hot dishes.  A few of the items were a little salty for my taste but with a buffet style service, if something didnt suit, you could replace it with something else.  The break service was astonishing--they really go all out!   If you are visiting during the right weather, do not miss the pool area.  Its fantastic!
4	Someone asked the question in the Yelp talk threads where the best place was for fried things, like french fries and onion rings.  Several people said Teds had great onion rings......so off I went!   I expected a smaller place but I was pleasantly suprised when I pulled up to a medium sized store.  I was greated with a smile and asked what I would like.  It was a Sunday afternoon so they were not very busy.  I liked the fact that you tell them what you want and they toss it on the grill right in front of you.  Everything is freshly cooked.  They did the same with the onion rings and french fries too.  Everything was fresh and hot.  My daughter had her favorite....a hot dog, which she loved, and fries which were fresh and crisp.  I had a burger and onion rings.  Yes, the onion rings were delicious!  The batter was great and the onions were a little on the sweet side.  My burger was cooked to perfection.   This is another great little place we will go back to.  Its also sort of near my work so maybe Ill get out one day and go here for lunch.  Thanks Teds and Yelpers!
4	After browsing at the Bookmans next door, we were feeling hungry and were tempted by the notion of tasty burritos.  We ended up getting non-burrito meals, but were fully satisfied with our entrees.  The green chile plate was filled with perfectly cooked pork with a spicy tomatillo sauce that went well with the pork.  The horchata tasted freshly made and was very refreshing and light.  Overall, I think Big Burrito is a good option for those that want a filling meal without breaking your wallet.
1	Prices are often way too high!
4	I have been to this place twice so far.  The first time I had no idea what to expect since I never heard of it before.  I honestly have no idea what to compare it to but I guess the closest thing is Texas Road House judging by the reviews here on Yelp.  Anyway, I know its not the classiest joint with the best food, but anything is worth a fair shot.  The first time my wife and I went we were in the area doing some shopping and just wanted something quick and casual for dinner.  We didnt expect anything great but to be honest our expectations were exceeded. The happy hour is pretty good.  $3 pints and 2 for 1 cocktails/wine.  Both times we went we ordered a 2 for 1 drink which would have been ok if they didnt charge too much for the first one.  I mean $5 for a small glass of Yellow Tail?  They are giving you 2 though so I cant complain too much I guess. The thing we love about this place is the 2 meals for $13.99 special they have going on.  There are some pretty good options if you stay away from the fried stuff.  So far we have had the chop steak, steak and the salmon.  They are all very good and decently sized.  They prepare them however you want (sauce on the side, etc.) and everything comes with 2 sides.  There are 10 or so sides to choose from.  I get a side salad and some grilled onions or mushrooms to go with whatever meat I am having and they are always very good.  My wife always gets some sort of grilled vegetable and they are good as well.  The service is very fast and friendly and the food always comes out pretty quick.  Oh yeah, and I also am a fan of their peanuts as well as the rolls that you get to start.
2	The wood saw is always out of service... The garden department is nice, but the staff is a little strange. This location never seems to be busy, so check out times are short.  The prices are higher than "another" home improvement store just east on Baseline. Meh.
2	Ive never been to a restaurant where we (a party of 6 with a reservation) sat at a cleared table with no water, no bread, no cutlery, no service for 15 minutes before receiving a menu .... when we finally had someone provide a menu, it then took another 15 minutes to get the wine we ordered.  Still no bread, still no food.  The server dumped the wine bottle on the table (unopened), and went to find glasses. 10 minutes later she then threw the bottle opener at our table so we could open the wine ourselves while she went to find glasses. Most (!?!) of the wine glasses arrived within the next 10 minutes, and still no bread or food.  Do I need to go on?  And while the server apologized profusely, she never offered to take anything off the bill or even a dessert on the house for our clearly disgruntled group.  Food was fine -- the house-made burrata is quite remarkable. But not enough of a reason to return. Others we were with have had better experiences, and I would hope for the owners sake that our dinner was an aberration...
1	My wife and I live around the corner, hadnt eaten here in a few months. We got food for take out, Mongolian beef,kung po chicken,pad Thai noodles.  Mongolian beef, there were more white onions then scallions and it was very bland. Kung po chicken,lots of white meat chicken the whole dish only had one peanut and the taste of this dish was non existent. Very very Blah... Pad Thai noodles,the dish was dry and came out of the container in one giant clump. It tasted like plain noodles, i was glad I had peanut sauce in the fridge to,add to it. Then it was edible .... We will not be going back to G@S.. Very disappointed !!!! From now on it will be Jade palace on 92nd street. For take out Asian !!!!  Do yourself a favor go elsewhere !!!!
1	Ok, so I have to share my morning experience. But first I must start off by saying this: Im no moron. Honest.  So, this morning I stopped for gas. My tank was getting dangerously low and there was no way Id make it to work. Thats okay, for I allotted time this morning for re-filling my tank. From my casa, I turned East on Indian School, vaguely remembering theres a Quick Trip nearby. Perfect. I had stopped there before.  But it wasnt a Quick Trip I saw at the corner of Central and Indian School. Not wanting to risk running out of gas, I opted to stop here, at this ampm station.  I pulled up to the closest gas tank, got out of my car, took off my gas cap and reached for the gas nozzle. Only then I discovered there was no pay-at-the-pump option. The short notice on the pump said to select my grade and start filling. "Wow," I thought, "Its so odd for a station to trust people - especially in this area - to not drive off without paying."  So, I followed the instructions, but nothing happened. I kept hitting the grade button. It kept beeping back at me. Still nothing. To top it off (no pun intended), the nozzle was wrapped in this huge rubber tube thing that compressed when I applied pressure to the handle. I had never seen anything like it.  Thinking my particular pump was fuct up, I pulled my car up to the next one. Thats when I saw it - this strange machine, like an Amtrack ticket dispenser. I approached with curiously. Thats when I realized. You swipe your card at this central machine (or deposit cash, if thats your preference) and then go back to your pump. Ah-ha. This is how this station works. So, I did just that. I punched in my gas pump number (4) and went back to my car to re-fill the tank. Already annoyed at this point, I figured Id pump enough gas to get me through the next couple of days.  Only, it wasnt pumping. The long rubber thingy was hindering my ability to hook the nozzle up to my gas tank. UGH. So, thats when I flexed my muscles and applied enough pressure to squeeze out $12 worth of gas. Then I re-hooked the nozzle on its perch and walked back to the strange machine for my receipt - it told me to do so when I swiped my card. Only, no receipt came out. I punched the keypad with defiance and walked off.  Stupid ampm station. Since when does any gas station benefit from being different? Im so used to pay-at-the-pump; you just swipe your card, select your grade, pump your gas, grab your receipt and go. Quick Trip doesnt torment me like this. There is no rubber nozzle thingy in my way. Grr. Screw this. Im never going back there again.  (Disclaimer: Said writer of review graduated high school with a 3.98 G.P.A  and attended a well accredited college of her choice, where you went on to graduate with honors, having made the Deans and Presidents Honor roll more than once.

3	Found this place by accident.  Not the greatest location. The pulled pork rates about an 8 on my scale.  Didnt need sauce, but the sauce (sweet) was good.  The Ranch beans are a tad spicy but still good.  The slaw needs a little help. I will definitely go back and sample the rest of the menu.
4	Im a little bit country. Im a little bit rock n roll...thank you Donny and Marie. Pinnacle Peak General Store is all country baby. 100% U.S. grade countrilicous! Well, ok, its in North Scottsdale so its got a pretty yuppified clientele. Part gas station, convienence store, cafe and post office....this is the cutest place ever. Was kinda my morning hang when I lived at DCRanch. Cup o joe, and the #1 Breakfast with 1 pancake, 2 eggs and bacon. Im tellin ya...its good. Hard to screw up bacon and eggs so Ill rave about my pcake...a bit crispy around the edges and full of buttermilk flavor. Syrup is heated just right and comes in a squeeze bottle the waitress pulls out of her apron pocket. Is that a squeeze bottle of syrup in your apron or are you just happy to see me? Coffee is sturdy and aromatic...like my lesbian cousin Rita. I havent eaten off the lunch menu...to me its all about breakfast. My friends have ordered and enjoyed canteloupe with cottage cheese and some kind of omelette which escapes me now, cuz, frankly, Im not a big fan of the omelette. Childhood trauma and I cant go into it now. The funniest thing about this place are the copper pots and other bric a brac hanging from the rafters that are all for sale. Some of the pots are like $100! OMG....They also have a gas pump thats like $5,000...I guess thats where North Scottsdale meets the country general store. So hitch up the wagon and skeedaddle on up to the Pinnacle Peak General Store. Tell em Thomas sent ya
5	This subway is one of the cleanest, and most efficient subways I have EVER been to.  Ive only been in the evenings, but I have to say every time I walk in, someone is always cleaning something.  Their employees are friendly and the food under the glass is fresh looking and appetizing and in their own bins.  Sometimes you can go to a subway and the prep area is a wreck. Thats what makes this Subway so great. Everything is in its place, and orderly and makes you feel like they take pride in their work.  Absolutely I will go here again, and I cant say that about many Subways unfortunately.
5	I agree with the other reviewers.. Ink bomb is definitely a shop that has a family vibe. All the tattooers are down to earth and have you, their customer in mind. There are usually 3 or 4 tattooers there, giving you a wide variety on technique, style, and experience.. all of which are important when picking your tattooer. I suggest always going in and having a consultation and looking at each persons portfolio to choose someone who fits your style whether it be "New school" or "Traditional"   This shop has on open layout and a friendly vibe which allows your to let your guard down a bit.. because we all know tattoo shops can be intimidating.... I will definitely be recommending this to all my friends and family.
5	Simply the best sandwiches I have ever tasted. The Mozarella, Tomato, Basil is perfect. The focaccia bread is perfectly crunchy and slightly salted to the consummate texture. I wish I still worked closer...
5	Went here today Sunday about 8:50 and it was crowded but not to bad, about 1/2 hour wait. Im warning you now, dont ask how much longer after you put your name in if they told you how long when you checked in.  About 10am is when it really got packed, just about when we got done. I ordered the chicken and waffles and i really liked it. I asked for some butter for my waffle because it didnt come with any and it made the dish perfect for me. The chicken had great flavor and when you take a bite with the waffle and butter and the syrup, heaven. I tried some bites without the butter and it wasnt even close to be the same for me.  My grandma got some omellete and she gave me some because she knew she wouldnt finish it and i would order that also. The omelletes are pretty good size but my wifes dish, my sons and mine where not that much food especially for $9. We are use to getting enough food for 2 when you eat at breakfast places and slighty cheaper. Not complaining because it was good but be ready.  There was 2 guys sitting next to use and trying to eat there 30 minute food challange. big ass egg plate with bacon and hash browns, they both only made thru about halfway.  I would definilty go back and get the same stuff. I also got a lemonade with mint and it was just right. My son really didnt like his reeses pancakes. Id like to go back and try some of this stuff ham steak w/ gravy, chicken fried steak w/ hashbrowns, bannana pecan caramel french toast
4	Great BBQ, although not a huge fan of the cafeteria style ordering. I have been twice, I got the brisket sandwich one time and ribs the next. Both were delicious. I added  bbq sauce to the ribs because I thought they needed it. Try the homemade root beer at least once, too. YUM. We got there just in time ( a bit before 6 on a Friday night)  as we were leaving the line was 3x as long...out the door and around the corner.  Oh FYI...for sides I got the beans (loved them) and my kids said the macaroni and cheese was good. Dad wasnt impressed with the coleslaw.
2	Well I just wasted 38 bucks....never again
3	While staying at The Pointe Hilton Tapatio, we decided to eat here for our anniversary dinner. To sum it up, Ive had everything better somewhere else. Nothing blew my socks off.  Hubby is eating mostly vegetarian right now (due to a health concern), and he did really like his "wild mushroom" rigatoni. We werent sure what was so "wild" about criminis and portobellos, but the pasta was in a light sauce with plenty of other veggies. His French Onion Soup was better at Capital Grille, my antipasto plate was far better at Craftsteak, and my ribeye was far better at 1130. They did serve a neat wedge of au gratin potatoes- multiple paper thin cheesy slices cut into a triangle. The gins are standard, but Hubby had a nice Bonny Doon Riesling. The free anniversary creme brulee was on the runny side, the vanilla was indiscernible, and the sugar crust was too thick- Ruths Chris still wins that one in my book. Did I feel dinner was worth $120? Not so much. The service at dinner was great, and it was fine at breakfast. Again, everything was decidedly mediocre and way overpriced. Ive had a better Belgian waffle at IHOP, my bacon was limp, and the coffee not what I would expect from the Hilton. Hubbys BLT breakfast bagel was better. Come on, Hilton! Is this the best you can do?
1	Ive eaten here many times, but none as bad as last night. Service was excellent, and highly attentive. Food, absolutely horrible. My expectation was they would serve a steak on par with their seafood. After all, they were charging 39 bucks for a ribeye.  What I was hoping for was a 1- 1-1/2 thick steak, cooked Pittsburgh style as I had ordered.  What I got a a 3/4 in thick piece of meat that was mostly fat, gristle, and in no way resembled Pittsburgh Style.  Salad, similar to something you could get at Chick Filet Veggies, blah. Bread basket, ample, but day old, and if not, it certainly wasnt fresh.  In addition to bad food, we were crammed into a small room where we were nuts to butts with 6 other tables, listening to conversations ranging from someones recent bout with pinkeye, and another couple who elected to speak entirely in French, until the waiter showed up, then it was like they turned off the French switch and suddenly began speaking English.  Ive had it with this place. If Im going to pay 150 bucks for dinner, itll be at Mortons, or Maestro where the steaks are 1-1/2 in thick, cooked to perfection, and half of it doesnt wind up on the plate as fat and gristle
1	Some of my friends brought me here last night and the first thing that came into my mind was that this was a set up for To Catch A Predator. I was ready for Chris Hansen to pop out and grill me with, "What are you doing here?" If you feel like Kubricks Lolita really speaks to you, as in it mirrors your life, then youve found a place to feel comfortable in your pervert skin. If youre of age to consume alcohol, theyve got a bar here. The thing about this bar though is that theyre really sloppy about pouring drinks, ie. a Manhattan should not taste like a barbers cleaning solution. The decor and set up of this place really needs a face lift. A few pluses though... If youre under 21, I could see how this would be appealing. Ill admit that the under-21 clubs that I went to when I was under 21 were fun, but now that I think about them they really suck. It seems like an alright experience if this is your first step into the club/bar world. The DJs here spin pretty much straight hip-hop which is fine, its very mainstream though and nasty bumping music. If you go here youre one of three types of people: 1) You were dragged here by your friends 2) Youre under 21 or, 3) Your usual excuse is a heart-felt plea, complete with waterworks, that goes something along the lines of, "I swear, Officer, I thought she was 18!!!!"
3	Uh-oh. Where am I?  The view from atop the mountain is superb. The city can be seen in all directions. Look, theres Downtown 1 and Downtown 2. And a bunch of houses under construction. And look at that sky. Wowza.  Ok, so stopping to enjoy the view is one thing. Stopping to figure out where the hell you are is another. "Dont worry," I told my friend. "This city is laid out in a grid. If anything, we can walk down the other side of the mountain and cut back across on the street." Oh, little did I know.  Let me give you the back story. Ive been to South Mountain twice. The first time was Christmas Eve 2006 when hardly a soul could be found. I met a friend there and we blazed our own trail. He always had his jeep in sight, so no harm in getting turned around. I trusted him to be my guide.  The second and last time I hiked South Mountain was in February. My best friend flew in to Phoenix for the weekend (for my birthday) and since the weather was so great (in comparison to Detroit), she wanted to be out in the sun as much as possible. No problem. I knew where we could go for a good hike. Little did I know wed get lost.  We parked at the 24th St. entrance and picked our path, the Mormon Trail. We were on our way to discovering religion, we joked, passing by several other hikers. When we reached a recognizable summit, we stopped to appreciate the view... and then ponder our location. Should we turn around and go back the way we came? Were we still on the Mormon Trail? Where were the markers, the loops, the signs from God? We looked at each other, each of us having a take-no-prisoners personality when it comes to conquering great piles of rock. "Onward!" we shouted, punching the air with our fists.  A little while later, we were once again stopped, our eye squinting against the retiring sun. I wouldnt call us "lost," as this point in time, but thats only because Im too stubborn to admit such an error. "Lets ask somebody," I suggested. So, the next hiker dude that passed by, we stopped to ask him, "Will this trail loop back around?" "Where do you want to go?" he asked. Thats when I realized we had tied our tennis shoes tight only to march into a rocky labyrinth. I told him where we parked and he said it was a good 2 hour hike back to our car, yet about another mile or two to the 48th St. entrance. Oh, no problem, I thought, since the city was laid out like a grid. Little did I know there are exceptions to that.  We pressed on, thanking our impromptu guide friend. We hiked and hiked and hiked, passing by fellow hikers and mountain bikers. Finally, the trail opened up to flat land. We were close, or so we thought. When we reached the end of the trail, there was no parking lot and no street connecting us to where we needed to go. Instead, there was a long gravel road that weaved itself through a golf course. W.T.F. We set out to walk the long gravel road until we hit Baseline, in which we were determined to cut back Westward and find my car, the only way we had of getting anywhere. The sun was setting. We had no time to waste.  Having hiked about 15 miles already, our feet were heavy, like cinder blocks. But, we continued on. "Lets hitch a ride," I suggested. People were gathering in their wonderful Ford pick-up trucks and jeeps. Hikers are friendly, I thought; somebody was bound to accept our plea for help. We opted to just do this ourselves.  Thats when a car slowed down. "Ugh, creep," I thought. Instead, it was our helpful hiker friend from the summit. He asked if we needed a ride. My best friend and I exchanged glances. I thought, "We can take him." After a 70-second long pause, we accepted. She hopped in back and I rode shot gun, leaving my seat-belt off and the door unlocked, in case of a speedy getaway.  We chit chatted on the drive down the road, which lead to another road, and then another and another, until we finally touched Baseline. Where the hell were we? Thats when it hit us. We would have been walking another 7 miles on foot back to my car. All these windy, disjointed roads. Damn golf course. Damn South Mountain. Damn unmarked trails. It should change its name to the Moron Trail, for we just blazed it enthusiastically.  The kind hiker man dropped us off at my car and drove away. With a sigh large enough to blanket the skyline, we unlocked my car, got inside and drove away - away from South Mountain, natures beast and practical joker.  We counted the miles and the minutes it would have taken us to get back to my car. Another hour, at least. The sun would have set by then and we would have missed our dinner engagement. Lucky for us, we stopped the right hiker friend at the right moment; otherwise, I may never have made it home to write this review.
4	Mmmmm, Mmmmmm, Great food.  The popcorn shrimp here are to die for-they leave a wonderful lasting impression.  So does their desert plate...The service was wonderful and quick and attending to us.  Also, we had been lounging at the pool all day and were not looking so sharp but they didnt seem to have a dress code or anything as they were more than welcoming.  It is a bit pricey but im not sure you can expect anything less when going to a W Hotel.  I recommend this place to anyone who wants a more chic sushi experience, cool atmosphere, doesnt mind paying the extra dollar and enjoys tasty food.
4	Decor  functional  Staff friendly and are really kind to our toddler food rocks  within my  limited range of  red and yellow curries ( so much so they suggested I try something else, hey its not my fault these are so good that I didnt want to risk anything lesser.  Prices are a bargain for entrees,  spice is there, they really get the request to make it very very hot.   This is probably the best bargain  in North Phoenix for  spice hounds
4	I was looking for a comforter for my new bed when I realized that this B,B, and B was close by so I stopped in to look around.  This is a nice store, It was organized well and the sales people were nice, not pushy.  I did not find a comforter but I did find several other things.  They have a nice selection of quality products and those 20% off coupons I get in the mail arent bad either.  Prices can be a little high on some things but with that coupon they are about right.  I spent about an hour browsing through the store. They have a great knife section, coffee pots, food processor and all manor of kitchen gadgets too.  Just the kinds of things I love to look at.  Im sure I will be back since its in my "hood".  Thanks B,B, and B!
5	I had lunch today at CASK 63 with a banker to discuss our collective power to create business in the Phoenix Market. I HAD THE ABSOLUTE BEST CRAB SALAD, Ive had since leaving the Gulf Coast of Mississippi. Red Crab Salad....fresh, clean, sweet, crisp..light...in a very well appointed setting. Very  good iced teas as well....hard to find in Phoenix.....Go there...Eat there...you will like it..and we might see one another...who knows...be like nike..just do it...:)
4	While Im a sushi fan, my husband is a sushi FIEND - we made biweekly trips to his favorite haunt in NYC (Monster Sushi) and if he was on his own for dinner, I could always count on him to be there for a bite.  After relocating to Phoenix, hed been jonesing hardcore for non-commercial, non-fussy sushi in epic proportions served with a smile.  Our trusted source told us that Kyoto was their favorite and we had to indulge.  The mixed views on Yelp made be a tad nervous, but I like to give places an unbiased chance.  Very glad that I did. The interior of the place is a little strange given the shape of the restaurant and lack of windows, but we made ourselves cozy in a table next to the sushi bar.  I also did not notice a pre-club atmosphere - it was chill the night we went, but maybe it was because we went after work (which is probably on the earlier side for the see and be seens). No teppan for us that night - it was all about the sushi.  We started with a pleasantly savory miso soup, flavorful seaweed salad and moist, tender tako (octopus) salad.  Next was my favorite dish of the night (and no, not traditional for sushi, but whatever) - a peppered, seared tuna with onion sauce.  Divine!  I could have had three plates of this and called it a day.  Most of the folks in our party ordered rather classic rolls, while I ordered an additional three specialty rolls (Candy Cane, Ichi and Shrimp Tempura - I love to crunch it out).  The rolls were so HUGE we struggled to eat it all.  Keep in mind that those specialty rolls are massive, particularly the Ichi (should have been called Ichi the Killer Roll) which you could barely eat with chopsticks.  I was a mess of dungeoness crab and spicy tuna by the end of the night, but I was happy. Price was absolutely fair for the quality of the food - there are many (MANY) overprices sushi places in Scottsdale and many dirt cheap places in the valley.  This one charges fairly and keeps the quality up.  I dont ever mind paying if its worth it. Will most definitely come back and hopefully take in some teppan next time :)
1	If you have to be some place on time, dont use them.  I called at 2pm for a 4:15 taxi to arrive.  At 4:25 they were calling me saying he was right around the corner, and gave me his location.  Estrella called a couple more times to "verify my address".  At 4:35 I called them and cancelled the cab and got a ride from my neighbor.  As we pulled out of my neighborhood, we PASSED the cab. He had taken a street that he thought was going to be a through street and got himself lost. This is a TAXI service, they should know how to get around the valley!!  Dont these people use GPS, or MAPS at least?!?!?!?  End of story, I was still late for my class that I paid 250.00 bucks for. I was not allowed in, and the money is non refundable.  So thanks Estrella wasting my time and costing me money.  WORST TAXI SERVICE EVER.
1	When owners/staff changed we kept hoping for the best.  (The friendly owners/cooks of the previous restaurant were top notch, hence the good reviews).  But now, alas. . . Lemon chicken that turned out to be pork (and bad at that), wontons in soup that fall apart, greasy greasy lo mein and eggrolls, its just not worth it.  Prefer to give locals the business, but this is truly awful, even after many hopeful tries.  Panda Express it is until someone else does a better job.
3	I like it better then Dennys so I stop on by to get some breakfast. Its okay not the best place in the world but if your having a hard time picking between after hours with Dennys and Waffle house I would pick waffle house for sure.
4	Neat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This place is like a trip to a non-petting zoo and aquarium and aviary while you dine on fairly decent Mexican food.  I was here for a late brunch and didnt wait at all.  I was near a window that right on the pond, and just about every turtle in the pond crawled out to come on over and see what the Rock was cooking and how I was enjoying it... no joke, see pic! The ducks and geese were very active in the lagoon, showing off for all the diners, and it thrilled the kids to pieces.  The guacamole is decent and the 3 types of salsa youre given were all good in their own ways.   If anything, swing in here for the atmosphere.  I bet its awesome at night.
4	Ive been going to this place for years, and they have always stayed true to their own style.  The place is a bit shabby, but the food is delicious. Their prices are decent, not too expensive not too cheap.  The staff is friendly enough, and if anything ever goes wrong, they have no problem fixing it. All in all, a good place to grab a slice of pizza.
4	Beer is almost a 4, food is a 3, service was a 4.5.  + Check in deal makes it a 5.  Add that up and divide by the hungry fellow and you get a 4.   I got a pretzel and an oatmeal stout pulled pork burger.  Forget the pretzel, its a essentially a utensil to enjoy their amazing sauces.  Even if you dont like pretzels or the sauce, it makes for a great palate cleanser between beers.  The burger was nothing spectacular.  I dont know where the oatmeal stout in the sauce, but it might have been in there.  Best part of the trip was getting a got a complete education beer mixology.  WHAT PEOPLE MIX BEERS!   I learned about the Stumbler and the Snake bite; ask and you shall receive.   Sampler note: Make sure to bring another mouth to finish a sampler, unless you plan to taxi and walk home.   Beer Recommendations: Lady friend who hates beer: Snake Bite Hop Head: Pale Complex Beer Drinker: Stumbler or MonkeyShine Pilsner.  light and amazing wheat finish, I can drink this all day Blonde ok little citrus, Pilsner was better Pale. Light with dry bitter finish, not for average drinker  Red. Simple hoppy red  Brown. a bit darker crispy red Oatmeal. Not smooth enough for a dark oatmeal,  surprisingly a bit hoppy  Old Monkeyshines. Simply intriguing  If you are looking for a clean cut safe beer place with decent food and some beer geeks, Nimbus is your place.
3	I love the layout of this outdoor bar. However, the price of drinks here and the lack of well options is a huge turn off. Its also going to be interesting to see if people are into the idea of an outdoor "dance club" once summer comes back around.  The view is awesome. Im always up for supporting independent downtown businesses, this place just needs to make some changes to make me want to come back.
5	The waiter got the drink wrong: "up" means served strained without ice, not on the rocks, but I was happy about the mistake, The Salmon melted in my mouth and the bread pudding made me fat for hours, but was so worth it.  Great atmosphere and none of our plates were empty when taken away.  I would definitely go back.  Good service, great food, fun atmosphere.  Great flexible hours on a Sunday.  GO !
5	I am in love with Yogurtland fro yo!!  It is super delicious and inexpensive!!  I got the coconut and added shredded coconut and mochi pieces...yummm.   Cant wait to go back.
5	I found this restaurant when they were located in Buckeye. I have tried everything on the menu probably more than once and have never been disappointed. My favorite is the Red-Chili Frybread with cheese added. The service is excellent there. You always get treated friendly and with a smile!
1	We use to visit this Pub 10 years ago because they had a nice English waitress and excellent fish and chips for the price.  However, we went back a few weeks ago and boy were we disappointed.  The price of the fish and chip dinner went up and they cut the portion in half.  No one assisted us in putting two tables together, we had to do it ourselves.  Two guests wanted a good English hot tea and they didnt brew it in advance, it was just thrown into a small metal tea pot and we had to ask for cream and sugar.  So weve decided there are newer and better places to eat fish and chips, especially up in north Phoenix.
2	Writing my 7/29/11 review prompted me to return to this establishment for a manicure. I got there at 9am, but unfortunately the sign on the door states they dont open until 10am. So I ran a few errands and returned at 10am. There was no one in the store and all the lights were out. Again, it is already over 100 degrees outside by 10am. I decided I didnt need a manicure that bad and left.
2	This place is way under seasoned.  The beans were ok.  I hate that they use store bought tortillas.  I dont plan on returning.  There are better places near downtown Chandler.
4	If you appreciate a good dive bar, you will love this place!  We came here for the first time when our team was playing in Glendale.  Dos Gringos played host to all BCS fans and it was a blast.  They have giant Jenga, dancing, multiple levels & bars and a great outdoor space. The facilities are a little beat, definitely a place where you dont want to touch anything in the bathroom, at least when it is packed.   The bar staff does a good job of managing the crowd and I never felt like I was wasting time begging for them to ask me what I wanted. We returned for a bachelorette party and although we still had a good time, I think this place really thrives when you are with a huge group.  Food is decent, but not why you come here.
3	As Targets go this one is standard fare. That consistency is part of their brand recognition. However, as a part of the Up-Scale Desert Ridge Shopping Center, Id expect a bit more than a Standard Target. Dont they have some sort of a Flagship Target? Also traffic and parking can be atrocious at Desert Ridge. I drive to Targets and WalMarts much further from my house because the round trip time is less when I dont have to negotiate the teen packed Desert Ridge lot. Probably safer too.
4	Lets rewind four years: "Youve never been to Chino Bandido?" "No, what is it?" "How long have you lived here?" "About eleven years, but a bunch of those years were when I was a toddler, and I just moved back from a few years in Flagstaff." "And youve never been to Chino?" "NO. What is it?" "Amazing." "Take me there." "Okay." Yet we never went. On the drive home from the Childrens Museum of Phoenix, I realized that I was hungry, on a budget, and Chino Bandido was not too far off of path.  I ran the plan by my father, checking to make sure that would be an appropriate Fathers Day dinner.  I received a confused look and thumbs up.  Hes not the most adventurous when it comes to dining experiences, but is generally a good sport. If my friend and I had been on the ball, I could have been eating here for four years.  Granted, I rarely have business around 19th and Greenway, but I could have made Chino Bandido my business. We both ate a perfectly reasonably sized and delicious dinner for less than $10.  Three cheers for Caribbean influenced burritos and homemade teriyaki sauce. Stevey P mentioned the only reason Im giving four instead of five stars: If the dining room werent so disgusting that I had trouble eating in it, it would easily be a five star place.  Wipe down the counters and tables, and perhaps give it a new coat of paint, and Ill be completely thrilled.
2	Ahh man, .....I REALLY wanted this to be good. But honestly, you end up with something thats more like "flame broiled" than the earthy wood-fired imagery you pick up from their corporately consistent signage, menu, and decor. That being said, its a cool concept, and great crust- but the signature pizzas like the "Greek" end up feeling themed ,and lacking of soul and an intuitive fussing-over that they need to really be crack good. The salads, while seemingly possessing all the right stuff- are the same. Too salty/ too soggy, and somehow too rich. The gelato tastes like it must come from a squeeze tube. Anyhow- enough bitching. Better than Pizza Hut, but for all the fuss and flash, you expect alot more.
5	WOW what can I say... our friends have eaten here for years and we finally got to eat at Don and Charlies for the first time in all the years that we have been coming to Spring Training.   We had an excellent dinner i was in the mood for fish and had the Macademia crusted Halibut.... WONDERFUL!!!!! My hubby had the prime rib and finished off every last juicy bite... the scalloped potatoes were the BEST I have ever had at any restaurant. Must make this one of our usual stops during our yearly visit to Az.
5	Favorite Pho in the phoenix area so far.   Great, tender meat in my pho chin nam (#8). I see they also have bun bo hue on the menu so Ill have to try that sometime soon.     Nom nom. Friendly staff. See ya there!
2	Wasnt impressed. Dressing tasted like a store bought bottle dressing and tomatoes very very mushy.
4	This review is specifically for my experience at Trader Vics last night (a Saturday night) for Happy Hour (4pm - 7pm). My wife and I and two friends had a great time!  We spent the Happy Hour in their outdoor bar area - so cool - which is slightly shaded and very calming.  The apps were tasty, especially for their low, low prices, and my wife really liked her  vodka cocktail on special.  They didnt have any beers on special, but I had a draft Stella anyway. Neither of us cared much for the fried calamari, but it wasnt bad, just not our style.  Everything else - the edamame, mini-burger, and sweet potato fries - was awesome.  Oh, and speaking of awesome, so was the service.  The waitress was friendly and helpful, and the bussers were very attentive! We will be back for Saturdays Happy Hour again soon.
3	Im giving the 3 stars solely for 1 reason:  The veggie sandwich!  Theres normally only 1 person waitressing/taking orders, so expect a slow turn around during breakfast & lunch time. To avoid the crowds Id pick up a flier in the morning, call around 10 am & pre-order for pick up. If I had no time to wait to check out I would simply ask for delivery. A girls gotta eat! :)
2	Years ago, and I do mean years ago, their Mill Avenue location in Tempe, was outstanding. As they expanded, the food along with the total expierence has gone DOWNHILL, big time. Why has this happened ... theyre doing franchising.   Im suggesting a name change: "My Big Fat Greek Disappoinment"
5	Really?  Because it doesnt get any better than this.  For what it is and for what its worth this place is truly unique.  A slight step up from a hole in the wall type of place, this quaint spot serves up good, tasty, and satisfying food hot from the kitchen. What is a pasty? A pastys history can be associated with the tin miners in England.  The story goes that these miners were covered head to toe in dust and other nasty stuff and would eat these calzone like dishes as a means to have nourishment without the need to return to the surface.  Supposedly, the miners were able to eat the pastry like food by holding onto the "handles" and when done, discard the tainted remains into the mine thereby appeasing the spirits that haunted the mines. At the Cornish Pasty Co. I can first hand recommend the Chicken Pesto.  Very good flavoring and filling.  Or you can go with the more traditional route with beef, potatoes, and swede.  The sauces that come with your pasty are there to accent the flavors and are highly recommend to try as well. Pros * Good food * Originality * Portions * Customer service * Coat hooks at the bar Cons * Small interior
4	Oz is a great local bar and a nice change from the bumping Charlies (which, dont get me wrong, is still a good bar). Booker, the bartender, is the coolest and will bring you any of the toys on the back counter, so long as he has time. The cheap prices, awesome juke box (sorry Korina, we were probably the ones playing all the Madonna) and a chance of spotting Stephanie Ann--the most fabulous drag queen around who really knows her vodka--are but a few of the reasons why I  love this place. Its also walking distance from my BFFs house.
3	Love the atmosphere and how trendy rhus place is, reminds me of Nip/tuck kinda, the way they have it set up. I had thd NY strip steak and i don not think it was worth the price. The steak did not come with a side. Sides are ordered seperately. Great customer service, however I dont think I will be eating here again.
5	I dropped off a ton of things here when I was liquidating my life in this town and it was a terrific experience. Their donation program is quick and easy (just drive around to the back of the store and put it in a bin) and really helps out people by selling things at affordable prices and the profits go to provide assistance to the community. Such great people at this location especially.
2	I ALWAYS pay in cash at this Pandas. If it wasnt across the street from work, I wouldnt go here at all. Two separate times I have been double billed on my debit card for my lunch. Im not saying it was intentional, but either way it is annoying to have to dispute a charge with your bank. Fair warning.
5	I love love Barrio Cafe. The food is amazing and it is very cute and artsy.
3	La Condesa is in a rather unassuming location in Phoenix.  But has a nice atmosphere when you get inside.  The first thing I noticed was their huge salsa bar.  We sat down and were brought menus and chips.  I tried most of their salsas.  They all had their own very unique flavor.  the peanut salsa was really interesting.  My favorite was their tomatillo salsa.   I ordered the Oaxaca Mole taco and a carne asada taco.  The mole was excellent with great flavor.  The carne asada was bland and flavorless...huh?  I dumped salsa on the carne asada taco and when finished was rather disappointed in that particular offering. Also ordered their calabacitas.  They were seasoned well and tasted great.   I had a bite of my partners pork taco and it was amazing.   I am glad we found La Condesa and I will definitely visit again to try some more of their menu offerings.
5	Tried the Restaurant Week special, and chose the Stetson chopped salad, mixed mushrooms with polenta, and bread pudding.  The Stetson chopped was amazing.  The preparation is beautiful when they bring it out, and then the taste is the perfect mix of sweet, savory, crunchy, soft once the salad is mixed up.  I tried some of the testosterone salad, which was decent, and filled with a lot of well prepared beef, but it didnt quite compare to the chopped salad.   Just as a general side note, if you choose the restaurant week menu and have the chopped salad and then the mushrooms, I think the flavor of the chopped salad is more bold than the mushrooms, so the mushrooms will taste bland to you.  This happened to me as I transitioned from the salad to main dish, but when I took the mushrooms home in a to go box and ate them later, the more delicate flavor showed through and I appreciated it a lot more.   The bread pudding was amazing.  Perfectly moist, with lots of flavor, and not too sweet.   Service was excellent (Thanks Owen!), and along with the extensive selection of wines, they also have some more unique beers such as lambic, as well as a nice selection of non alcoholic sodas (The cream soda is locally made and very tasty!)
4	Yum! Delicious tasting pizza, a wonderful atmosphere, and oh those  Nutella crepes are devine!
4	I had a chicken panini and was more than enough! It was dinner and lunch! They have this special bread that is like a big bun. The people is very friendly and patient to explain their different options. Nice place, and for sandwiches it was just good.
4	I have to admit: I am impressed. I have been to a few vegan-only-menu restaurants and I was... underwhelmed. Nothing against the raw food movement, but unless it is a raw-specific place, I expect more creativity. Show me what food can do, be, taste like. Dont just cut it up and toss it on a plate. Four of us came in to eat on a Saturday and the place was PACKED. A good sign, surely, AND it was a really great mix of demographics: young and old, many nationalities, singles, couples, families... we liked that it had a wide appeal. The place smelled fantastic, too, so we started perusing the menu long before we had a table to sit at. We waited about ten minutes for a table. Its a bit like a cafeteria in that you order and pay at the counter, and the food is brought to your table. While we waited we were given a bowl of the "house soup" which, basically, was warm carrot water with a piece of carrot or two and some tiny, tiny mushrooms. We all agreed that it needed more of a broth flavor (more types of veg? more mushrooms?), but it was tasty enough and definitely whet our appetites for more. The spring rolls were really good but needed more. As we removed the peanuts for my friend, I "blame" this on us... I will have to have them with the peanuts next time. The crispy rolls were spiced and savory and light and perfectly crispy.  My favorite had to be the Pate Chaude. Flaky, savory with a bite from a wonderful combination of spices, and a meatiness from the mushrooms that made us think a die-hard carnivore in our lives may not miss the meat if he were to eat it. THE dish of the day, hands down. The curries were a bit bland (Save-Planet and Divine Curry Noodles). They were fine, OK, but nothing that made us think wed come just for that. Much better elsewhere. The Gracious Spicy Noodle soup was really tasty but it needed a tad more spice. With spicy in the name, we expected more.  Some stuff is pretty basic: the sushi rolls are basic veggie sushi rolls. The rainbow salad is a tasty but commonplace cabbage and carrot slaw. The fried rice was fried rice. All yummy, all fine to eat, but nothing spectacular, different, or altogether exciting. Basic isnt bad. Four stars for the surprising and amazing pate chaude and the rolls, for sure. Ideally, 3.5 stars this trip, but I rounded up for the good parts.  Couldnt go five stars for two reasons: too many items were just basic and the service is slooooooooow. 20+ minutes for fried rice (that we had to ask about)? 25+ minutes for some soup? It was a crap shoot as to what was going to be delivered and when. While they were swamped when we came in, the crowd was thinning out for their afternoon down time (they close from 3p-5p). Overall, our lunch took over 2 hours, most of it waiting on dishes to come out. No bueno if you have other plans that day. So... tasty, some major standouts, some "meh, Ive had this before." We *WILL* absolutely go back to give the menu more of a chance to wow us; the ones that knocked us off our feet are worth the return. (Hopefully its delivered a little faster this time!).
4	I am a huge fan of local coffee shops with free wifi. I am also a huge fan of iced lattes. I know, how trendy of me, dont judge, I have some weird phobia about drinking hot lattes...I cant explain it...getting off track...anyway! Cartel! I really like getting my work done here. This is a short walk away from Js place so whenever Im in town and need to get work done, I head here. I like the decor, I like the music they play (I dont even need to tune out with my headphones and spotify like I normally do when at coffee shops), and the coffee is pretty good. The ambience is chill and very oddly conducive to me getting things done. The staff here is really nice and friendly too. Note: They also always have tempting pastries that one day I am sure I will break down and try. Im nearly positive theyll be delicious. Like the 4 stars say... Yay! Im a fan!
4	OK, lets face it: there are better steaks in the Valley. As a matter of fact, if you just took the steak at face value, it might not even crack the top 5.  But Durants is not just about the steak, or even the food.  Durants is a classic in every sense of the word, the type of place that can rarely be found anywhwere in Phoenix. Its also a lively and classy night spot, something that didnt exist anywhere in downtown Phoenix for years, and as several new places have developed around Durants overe the past few years, it has remained consistent and cool.  And thats what Durnats is really about. Yeah, the steak is pretty good. The seafoods alright. The bread with the hot garlic butter is awesome. But Durants is just COOL. Its classic Vegas, Rat Pack-style cool, and you feel it from the moment you walk in.
5	This is a great dog park.  Plenty of grass to run around on, and there is always a good crowd to play with.  And drinking fountains and places to sit.  The majority of the dogs are nice, but there are a few Scottsdale poodles who think they are the shit and their owners just ignore their bad behavior.  I just stick my gum in their curly hair and go on with my day. The best part of the park is when I get home and the dog takes a nice long nap, and I can do chores in peace.
5	This has got to be the best barber shop Ive ever been to in my 38 years on this planet.  I was always getting terrible haircuts at places like Great Clips and Hair Cuttery (when I lived in Virginia Beach), and I just assumed it was because I naturally had jacked-up hair.  After getting my first haircut from Israel (the barber, not the country), I know Id have a hard time looking elsewhere.  I dont know if these dudes were ever in the military, but their attention to detail is top notch.
4	Got a pretty decent HAND car wash for $15.00.  They asked about extras but werent pushy about it.  After I paid I noticed their gas prices.  They were about $0.20 less than the going rate in the area.  The frosting on the cake was that I got a $2.00 senior discount.
4	Home made fresh noodles.  Reminds me of San Francisco china town food.
3	This really is more of a ladys hardware store with more design/decorating stuff, small appliances, and such. But this time they had something HD didnt, and at a good price.  Almost exactly what I was looking for, too. Even if youre a die-hard HD shopper, it doesnt hurt to check here too.
4	I found this on yelp and what a great wine bar! I went here last night after work with friends and we shared a bottle of wine and had sandwiches. It was so good cant remember either name of the wine or food. It was very small inside which made it cozy.
3	The very definition of an average brunch.  My omelet was pretty decent, and its nice that they let you choose a bunch of ingredients if you want to.  However the breakfast potatoes are extremely weak, fairly bland and underseasoned and are probably not hand cut and prepared.  They are mixed with an uninspiring blend of green peppers.   The rest of my table seemed to feel about as enthusiastic as I did about their breakfast burritos. The service was also pretty slow.  Despite the awesome patio and pretty good eye candy among the patronage here, this place is definitely one you can skip.
3	Glorified Pei Wei
5	Another great Italian find! My BF and I went to Roma Garden for dinner last night because he was given a gift certificate there from a friend.  Wed never heard of it, but were always up for trying something new, especially with $50 towards our meal.  We pulled up to their strip mall location without expectations and we were both pleasantly surprised! When you walk in, the lighting and decor are welcoming and the staff is friendly and attentive.  It was a Thursday night and there were plenty of other guests in the restaurant, and there was a lively energy in the air.  After browsing the menu, I ordered one of the few Chefs Specials of the night - tilapia with fresh veggies and pasta in a lemon caper sauce.  BF went with Pollo Parmagiana.  He had a glass of cabernet and I had pinot grigio... and voila - a warm bread basket arrived on our table at just the right time! We were both happy with our orders when they arrived as well... the fish was cooked just right and the sauce was tasty... good portions as well!  Although we were full, we decided to order a dessert to share - the homemade snow white chocolate tartufo - yum!  The perfect sweet ending to our meal.  In addition, we were each brought an after dinner drink of amaretto on the rocks, on the house. ****I just have to share that I was pleasantly surprised that the womens restroom was clean, spacious, and had a fresh fragrance to it - I normally dont notice that, but I was impressed by this! In speaking to the waiter and the owner, we learned that this restaurant recently changed locations but theyve been in business for over 15 years.  Gotta love the local businesses that last in the valley... well be back to support Roma Garden and enjoy their fine "Northern Italian Cuisine" without a doubt.  I suggest you go check it out also - bon appetito!
4	Im not a coffee snob, but I love a good Americano.   This place has the charm youd expect from a locally owned coffee shop complete with  eclectic decor, artwork on the walls, odds-and-ends of gaudy lamps and stained-glass windows.  The coffee is pretty good from what I have experienced.  The air-conditioning is right where it needs to be as well.  Most important factor for this business:  very nice staff.  That alone makes me want to come by more often.
5	Went here while on vacation in Phoneix based on seeing it on Man vs Food. Could not have been more impressed. Food was amazing. Far above expectations.  The torta was huge and delicious. Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic authentic meal at a good price!
4	The Hyatt Place Scottsdale is a hidden jewel in old town, just off the main drag this place is perfect for a weekend getaway.  They offer complimentary breakfast which is pretty standard but nice and even have "real" plates and utensils vs. plastic products.  They also have free WIFI and the rooms are HUGE!  It is a great place to take the family since the kids can stay in the first part of the room on the sofa sleeper while you can crash on the comfy bed closer to the TV. The only reason I give 4 stars vs. a perfect 5 is because the pool is really small and not that great.  If they upgraded the pool a bit they would be golden.
4	This is my neighborhood grocery store. Its at the two locations I shop at most. Its always clean and well stocked and I never have to wait in line for very long.
4	Some of the food here is fantastic such as the Chicken Corfu $14.95 and others like the Gyro I found to be less than good becasue the meat was very dry some parts burnt with the obviously strong taste of fish.  I sent it back and they took it off our bill.  The remainder of the meal which consisted of the Corfu, salads and soup was great and our waitress; the owners daughter promised to address the Gyro with the kitchen.  This restaurant is located at the park in Fountain Hills with unobstructed views of the lake and fountain which erupts every hour spraying water more than 500 feet in the air.  We took a nice walk in the park after dinner which was very relaxing.  Recommended
2	If you have $6 burning a hole in your pocket, and would like a thimble full of ice cream, this is your place. They have a terrific selection of flavors, and you can sample as many as you want before choosing, not to mention they are part of a coffee shop too. Unfortunately, they charge you a thousand dollars for a scoop of it. Id rather go to Mary Coyle and get a Banana Split for that price, or just save my money because the idea of paying $6 for a scoop of ice cream is absolutely a fool parting with his money. Two stars because it actually was tasty.
4	Loved the atmosphere most of all.  This is a converted bungalow house that should set an example for downtown revival in the future.   Very respectable selection of beer and wine and a limited menu, but with creative selections. * The house beer, made by Four Peaks, tasted like something made by Four Peaks, which, if youve ever had a beer crafted by Four Peaks, is the sincerest of compliments. *  The "G Red" blended red wine didnt suck.   *  The Ham and Eggs:  Deviled eggs were quite tasty.  The ham was medium-thickly sliced and put on a stick.  Nicely warmed.  How could you possibly f up ham? *  Grilled cheese and tomato soup:  Both quite delicious. * Cheese plate:  Three cheeses with toasted almonds, crackers, dried apricot and apple half.  Ive had better cheese.  Not the greatest selections.  Could stand to include a nice blue. An overall pleasant experience, but I agree with Omer K. that the music was distractingly loud. Fortunately, our service was acceptable.  No complaints about it.  Matt even passed through checking on customers a couple times and chatted with us briefly.
5	This is the new mecca of Phoenix music.  Charlie Levy who booked for the now legendary Nitas Hideaway and also the owner of Stateside Presents is the man behind it all! He is a music fan first and ... well ... thats just what he is ... a music fan not a natural businessman.  The place is just beautiful (for now, soon to be broken with the wear and tear of rock and roll no doubt). The room is small ... stage big (for the size) ... no doubt this is going to be the best place in the city to see any band for a long time to come! Thank you Charlie! Music fans unite! This place MUST thrive! btw ... they have live music every single night of the week ... and they open at 4pm every day (the lounge will have musicians and DJs for your entertainment).
4	This is a really nice coffee shop and restaurant tucked away in a corner toward the east end of City North. They have great food, wine and, well of course, coffee. We were there last Saturday and they had live music as well as an artist. April Howland from Howland Studios was there painting and giving a live demonstration. I am not certain how often they have music and an artist but if you managed to catch them one of these nights, you wont be disappointed. Also, make sure you try one of their fruit smoothies. They are simply amazing.
4	Took Mom for dinner Monday night. This was the second time I took her here, and itll be the last! Guess Tapino just isnt for her. Out of the three small plates we shared, she only enjoyed the lamb kabob over quinoa ($9). It was the second-best dish of the three I enjoyed. Id wanted to try a glass of rose ($7), since Mom is a fan, but she was "too tired" to have wine, so Ill have to bookmark that for next visit. We started w/ the butternut squash ravioli w/ sage butter ($8; mmm... I adore brown butter and sage... My Mom, however, doesnt). I appreciated the sweet creaminess of the squash puree against the slight toothiness of the ravioli. The sage butter added just enough salt to the dish, while the toasted candied pecan bits on top added impeccable crunch! How I wished I had all three pieces! (She ate one and didnt even enjoy it! How infuriating! LOL)The second dish we tried was the baked escargots w/ butter, parsley, lemon, and puff pastry ($7). Compared to the multi-faceted ravioli dish, this was a bit disappointing. While I enjoyed the textures that the snails and crunchy puff pastry offered (TOO crunchy, if you ask me! Those babies were bordering on hard! Wheres the "puff?," I ask.), the butter and parsley treatment fell flat. Mom again only had one. I believe there were 6 total. Dont misunderstand- I still ate all the rest... I was hungry!! :D Last, but not the least, came the skewer of lamb kabob (3 pcs; $9) w/ bell peppers and onions, served over cold saffron quinoa w/ cucumber sauce (served on the side).  Thankfully, the lamb pieces were savory enough not to have needed the sauce. Loved the quinoa. Check out the photos I took... Ill have to take a photo of the ravioli on my next visit!
2	I am a very loyal customer to pure sushi and have been for over 2 years now. Up until about 6 months ago I would have given this place 4, possibly 5 stars, but with the horrible service I have encountered the last 6 months Im only giving it 2. Normally I order my food to go at the bar and just take it home and eat it. But the for the last 6 months when I go in to order my food at the bar, its always the same bar tender working and she is rude. The last 3 times I have been into order food I ended up just walking out and not ordering anything. She is always taking to what seems to be her friends at the bar. I always know what I want right when I go in, so there is no need for a menu, she greets me and hands me a menu totally ignoring me telling her that I already knew what I wanted. Then she precedes to talk to her "friend" or whoever at the bar for 15 minutes before taking my order. I know all of her personal business and even what she plans on wearing to her friends wedding in a few weeks. The food is good, but considering there are so many other really great sushi places with so much better customer services i would not recommend this place at all. Now I totally understand if this happens once in a while, but it has happened every time I have gone in there for the past 6 months. I feel almost as if I were betrayed, I was such a loyal customer and referred so many people to Pure, I just hope they dont receive the same kind of service I do.
3	The sales people here are very knowledgable and helpful. They are also very friendly and great with reccomendations. I know it is a comic store but I only went there for DnD books/suppliments and ocassional Anime. I am pretty sure their Anime is bootleged, but due to how cheap it is and the fact that you usually cant find it anywhere else I dont care. They often come in complete sets for like 30 bucks which is great for a whole series. I have had problems watching them on PS2/Xbox sometimes but due to the price I keep coming back.  Now then if it werent for this next part they would have a 4 star. They no longer sell DnD books, or Dice sets which breaks my heart. They always had the best selection when it came to dice and I havent been able to find another place that carries more than 5-6 at a time. Out of all the Atomic Comics I have been to I like this one the most, the people there are always fun and inviting I cant stress that enough.
1	Once again, THE TROUGH SLURPERS offer far too many stars to this mundane eatery, proving again that they are truly CANAILLE of the first order.: Slow indifferent service Mediocre food The kind of wine that patrons of kokopelli swill with delight, calling it ambrosia when its actually dishwater. But..as with Kokopelli, it keeps the shit eaters out of the better restaurants! So, I say to you canaille..flock, flock there with your disruptive screaming children and your leathery palates.
2	We were excited when we found that we could add George and Sons to our delivery list.  The food is good, not great, but it was a great option on lazy nights.  Tonight when the food was delivered it seemed like the price was a bit high.  There wasnt an itemized receipt attached to the credit card slip so I said to the delivery guy this seems high.  He gave no explanation so I tipped as usual.  Well turns out that there is a $4 delivery charge so this guy made a pretty big tip for driving down the street. I have no problem with delivery charges because there are some crappy tippers out there; I just hate having extra charges slipped onto my bill with no explanation. This will probably be the last time we order.
5	Love this place ! Food is spicy and always cooked just right.  Menu changes every so often and have nightly specials too.  Service is great.  No matter what night you go it is busy. it is a great little find.
5	I attended a UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event) here and I have to say that Haus Murphys pretty much wowed all 20 or so of us! It has taken me over a week to get to the review.  I was still reflecting on the German meatloaf, red cabbage and Weihenstephaner Hefeweizen. How do you say, "Damn that was good!" in German?  I have new found respect for German cuisine thanks to Chef Hoffman (not sure about the spelling there). The fubar of Yelpers (I am pretty sure that is the correct term for a large gathering of Yelpers) dined on the patio which is a great space.  Service was very good throughout the meal. There was quite a bit of sharing going on and although I dont remember everything I tried, it was all really good. It was great to see so many friends and meet some new Yelpers like Norm!
4	Like Red Robin, Carrabas is my go-to Italian joint that I know I wont be disappointed in.   I love their bread and the yummy oil/herbs that go with it.  I do ask for butter as well, but they always seem to bring out this frozen ball of butter.  I dont get that. The best dish they have is their Pollo Rosa Maria.  It consists of two chicken breasts, stuff with fontina cheese and covered with a huge helping of sauteed mushrooms.  Make sure to get it with fettuccine alfredo.  Its a must!... if you dont like pasta, I dont know what to tel ya.  The combo of the two is a match made in heaven. They have great salads and their own special house dressing.  Heads up on your ranch lovers.  they do not have ranch dressing. As for their deserts, Im not much of a fan until they have their quarterly creme brulet. Good food!
4	The green chili  pulled pork omelet  was delightfully good.  The coffee was great, and so is the decor.  The cream chipped beef and biscuits are also pretty fantastic.
4	This is one of the only places in Phoenix that carries legitimate book binding supplies like book cloth and all sorts of decorative binding papers (unlike the decorative kind for scrapbooking). I love that I can order online, and then they will call me when my order is ready and I can just head on down to Tempe to pick my stuff up. While I havent taken any of their classes, they look pretty awesome. I have had experiences with old letter press techniques, and this place offers classes in it. I think Im going to have to sign up!
3	Their beef gyros are delicious!  Great portions for what you pay.  And their falafel is really good too.  Not a great portion it seems for an order of hummus, we got like one piece of pita.  Just didnt seem to be much there.  We always do carryout, and either the bartender is really nice and funny, or just werent very friendly.
5	One of my fav sushi places in the Valley.  Great place to take someone who has never tried sushi or still is unsure of what they like.  Great place to take someone who loves sushi but is indecisive.  Some of my favorites include the spicy shrimp/crab roll, Phoenix roll, and their squid salad.  Plus - you cant beat the Vegas roll - $1.50 for 3 pieces? Its a steal!  Definitely one of the more fun sushi places in the Valley!
4	So great to see the occasional NY style pizzeria pop up amid all these chi-town "pizza" impersonators... Sorry, but if you think pizza is cut in squares, or its crust should taste like a stale saltine cracker, perhaps this isnt for you. A great street style joint with friendly staff and always a great selection ready to go, and conveniently located right next to AMC 24. Bring a messenger bag or purse and get some Vincents to go, and avoid the concession stand. Just sayin...
3	I dont know what Bar Smith is trying to be. I feel like instead of just saying okay we are going to be a X music club on Saturday night they decided to try and appease too many people. 90s R&B and Hip hop on the first floor Techno Electronica on the roof top bar.  oooooKAY. I visited the during the 4th Annual Pub crawl at 11:30 at night the place was still pretty empty.  Drinks-Meh Crowd-Meh, I am still trying to find the young professional males in this area. Layout- I like it Bouncers-Really big and Super nice but then again I smiled a lot and didnt give them a hard time about my ID.  The last 2 is what gives it the A-Okay and not a full out Meh. I could see throwing a party there, people love dancing outside and on rooftops. This has both and the first floor DJ was decent, all things considered.  I will give this place another chance.  Maybe it can redeem itself up to 4 stars.
1	I am not a fan of this place. I like to try to stay positive though so here is my attempt a the proverbial "positive sandwich" Top Bun: The location is fantastic. I really like where it is, its a cute little place that is very easy to find. The Meat of the Matter: The food here is odd. I am very open to trying new things and experiencing different cultures. As I have mentioned in other reviews, I love all types of food from all over the world. I didnt care for this place. I ordered an appetizer that was wrapped in a banana leaf and i honestly thought I was eating an ashtray. It wasnt good. The pad thai that I sampled was very lifeless. I had a friend get a big bowl of soup that looked good but i didnt try it.  Lettuce, onions pickles, tomato: The service was not good. I sat at the bar the first time I went here and we got ignored for the most part. The bartender (who i believe doesnt work there anymore, luckily) sniffed at me when I asked for clarification on something. There are also jars of really weird floating things at the bar (probably pickled/preserved veggies/meat/fruits etc.) it was unappetizing to be around....I dont have a weak stomach at all, it was just odd. The second time I went in, the service was equally as bad. there was a table of 8 of us for lunch and the place was mostly dead and I had to go up and ask them to take our order after we sat waiting for 30 minutes. Subsequently, the menu is small and the prices are high with not much room for substitutions or changes Bottom bun: I like the owner, he is really nice and friendly. The cooks were also friendly. I like to believe that my taste buds merely didnt care for this place. I know a lot of people that have very positive things to say about this place. I will not recommend it as a personal favorite and I will quite frankly probably avoid it unless it is specifically requested by a client. I am completely fine with the concept that not everyone has to like the same things. I personally have not had a good experience with this place, but I respect the fact that a majority of the reviewers for it have.
5	I LOVE love LOVE Coffee Bean.  I have been in love with Coffee Bean for years.  I am so bummed out that they are not all over the place like the "S" coffee store.   One of my favie drinks are the Pure Cholocate Ice Blended with whip cream and Green Tea Latte.  The service is always friendly, perky, and fully of sunshine.
3	The noodles are delicious here. I had the vegetarian spicy noodle. It doesnt come with anything but noodles and the sauce. It would be great if they could add some veggies in there though. So you chose the type of noodle you want and then the flavor. The prices are super cheap and the service is fast. The portions are huge and I could have eaten the whole plate if I didnt stop myself. I am curious to know if they use MSG because it was that hard to stop eating.
1	Long wait for food, waitresses that dont know what theyre doing, grumpy hosts, and crappy food that keeps us off the lake for 2 hours is not somewhere I plan on going ever again.
5	Amazing sushi. Fast, clean, fresh. Friendly staff. Favorites are Arizona, Beauty, Alaska, and Spicy Ninja, although everything here is some of the best around hands down!
4	Part 2 of the business trip.  Dinner with the sales team. We always have fun when out on the road and this was no exception.  The need for sushi is somtimes primal.  This was one of those nights.   Starting off with happy hour prices that were awesome we easily knocked down three bottles of Sake while deciding what treats to order. We ordered a tableful of great sushi- alot of variety and had a great time.  The one disappointment was that the sushi just didnt have enough spice.  Not nearly enough heat.  The staff was excellent and very helpful.   I would recommend Ra.  The atmosphere alone- great music and fun staff is a good reason to go.
4	The 4 stars is in comparison to other Chipotles Ive been to, especially in this area. I have to admit, when they were building this plaza, my friends and I tried to guess every day what it was going to be. We had it narrowed down to a Chipotle or a sushi joint (both would kill me for sure) and I cannot believe we were actually right.  I am pretty pleased with this place. Both times Ive stopped by its been clean and pretty speedy service. Every time I come in, I am surprised by all the extra room around to the side and out on the patio and it makes me happy. Im sure anyone reading this has been to Chipotle, but if not, or if youre feeling like trying something new.. my signature dish for the past few years has been carnitas bowl with black beans, corn, fajita, lettuce and a little bit of the dairy stuff. Wash it down with a Nantucket nectar apple juice and youre golden.
4	Great place to see a show.  Prices are the best around, and its never too crowded.
4	Usually stop here for breakfast and mimosas. Agreed the service is not always the greatest but who expects 5star service at a breakfast/lunch cafe. I say have a mimosa and chill out. They also have a fun drink/beer list. Or fresh squeezed OJ that is worth the trip. The food is bought locally and prepared fresh so the wait is worth the quality. I usually do the omelettes... mushroom garlic. I cant refuse that mushroom sauce!! I have had their huge a#$ burgers and a couple of their sandwiches. The Loki and the vegetarian stand out. What ever you try I dont think you will be disappointed.
4	Nice clean airport with lots of places to shop and lots of food options.  Terminal 4 is nice. Two things:   1.  The marathon walk from the Southwest ticket counter to the D gates...good God, they need a tram or moving walkway. 2.  The Security bag screening machines are old and tiny; my bag got stuck; its NEVER been a problem at any other airport Ive been through (SMF, LAS, SNA, ONT, SAN, BUR, SEA, LAX...) Oh, and if you rent a car, be sure to allow extra time because the shuttle ride to/from the airport itself is at least 10 minutes.  But its a nice rental car area...
4	While doing a bicycle ride to the Orange Table, I pointed to a friend that LuLus Cupcakes was accessbile from our bike path. She immediately exclaimed- "we are SO there tomorrow!" Today, I get a phone call at 4pm, saying she is picking me up to go get those damn cupcakes. She was serious! Since I had off and she got off early, we were able to visit the holy mecca of cupcake land. She picked me up in what may be one of the most ridiculous blue convertables known to man and we zoomed up to Scottsdale, blasting bad hip hop, psyched about individual iced cakes! Upon arrival, the space was sparse and very IKEA-ish. Pinks and lime greens dominate the palate. To the right of the counter was t-shirts, rubber duckies and other merch. They do have a brown with orange stripes guy shirt...in XL. I guess big men love cupcakes! But the real star are the cupcakes themselves...lovingly displayed under glass domes. Carrot cakes, german chocolate cake, mocha chocolate cake, blonde (vanilla on vanilla), chocolate on vanilla, and the special of the day key lime....oh man. MERCY. I kept dodging between the carrot and the mocha and went for the Mocha. All natural ingrediants and VEGAN sprinkles! (But very much all dairy icings, btw). Our lady, I think Melissa, was super helpful and even offered samplings of cupcakes to help us decide. She put each individual cupcake in a plastic bubble and in a cute lime green/pink dotted bag. She noted they do have mini cupcakes for events (OMG) and I would totally splurge for those suckers.  The only real negative (besides times..I mean if this place was open late, it would be HEAVEN) was the lack of drink choices. Coffee, milk or water. Um..I mean, I dont knew a bazillion options, but even tea would have been nice. I chose hot coffee which was fine. But iced coffee as an option would have been kick ass...or lime rickeys! OMG! As an FYI, you can leave the strip mall complex and head down to the park and eat your delectables under  a shaded tree on a park bench over looking a "pond" like we did. I savoured my 2.95 cupcake, and the icing and cake was perfect. I cant even describe how yummy it was. It was worth every cent. And they arent gigantic, so you feel perfectly satisfied with your cupcake. 100% Natural, 100% Naughty is their logo...LOVE IT!
5	The Harkins Camelview 5 gives Arizonans the unique opportunity to see movies that are normally reserved for screens in NY and CA. Without this theater there would be very little chance to see independent or foreign films in Phoenix. I give a lot of credit to Dan Harkins for keeping this theater open. He certainly cant  make much money at this location. Its financially  impractical to keep such a small theater operating on such prime real estate. This just shows Dan Harkins commitment to sharing great films with the people of AZ.  Thanks Dan!
4	El Taco de Chandler exceeded my expectations.  Ive driven past it almost every day for a year.  My curiosity finally got to me, so my boyfriend and I went in to try the food.  We waited quite a few minutes (easily 10 to 15) for our order, which is a good sign for fresh preparations.  The joint is hooked up with a juke box, pool table, dining area with tables and chairs, and two benches near the register, for those waiting to take their food home.  There were special desserts in a glass display cabinet, including coconut clusters and sweets Ive seen in Mexico.  The assortment of beverages is outstanding, offering both Coke and Pepsi products, juices, CapriSun, horchata, beer, and Sunny Delight!  The menu is about par for Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area, in terms of content and price.  I got a fish taco, which was outstanding!  No cheap tartar sauce here!  I also got a cheese quesadilla, which came garnished with lettuce and tomato slices.  The quesadilla was warm and fresh, on an obviously fresh tortilla filled with tasty cheese.  For the two of us to eat a few a la carte items from the menu, the total came to $11.00.  There are also combination plates available, as well as quite a few soups.  Overall, I was very impressed!  This looks like a fun place to hang out.  The food is definitely worth the wait.  I happened to ask the cashier, and they are open until 10pm on Saturdays.  Muy delicious!
3	Drunk people go here. Service is good depending who you get. The Burger according to one Arik B can not taste his burger. When ask the server, how come my friend Arik b cant taste his burger? Why? You had to be there to laugh. What a fun night!!!! Dont order the pancakes, they are not very good. The chicken strips were a-ok.
4	I finally went here, after reading the reviews and pouting about how busy I was with work and how it is hard to find someone to be my Designated Driver, since Arizona is way more strict than NJ when it comes to people drinking and driving.   So, I finally arrived at Casey Moores last night and was impressed.  This is an upgraded Irish pub/bar with a great beer selection, yummy yummy yummy crab cakes, and a cozy atmosphere.   It was Thursday night in which they have a special on Kiltlifter (sp?) and I was pretty excited.  The music was not that good.  I wish that they would have a DJ there on busy THursday nights.  That would really enhance the atmosphere and probably their people traffic as well. I vote for a DJ on Thursday nights, heck, I have amazing music, I could just be the DJ. I will be back very soon to try their oysters and some of the other seafood dishes and of course more beer on tap. Seriously, you need a DJ on Thursday nights.
3	Not the newest or the nicest but, everything you need and usually no wait for machines. The staff is super nice and there are magazines to read while your there. If they could just turn up the AC a little bit and put ESPN on more than two of the TVs.
4	wouldnt you agree that a key part of enjoying the dining experience in part depends upon the company you are dining with?!  having said that, the times i have dined at abuelos have been with my fellow co-workers, all female, and yes, we all get along!  needless to say, we had totally fun & memorable experiences, filled with great conversations, great food and good prices.  their corn chips are fresh and lite, their salsa comes in different levels of heat.  i usually request the hot salsa.  im partial to their chicken enchilada.  portions are just right, one is plenty for me, usually served with rice.  in all fairness, believe i need to sample other dishes, before i could rate it any higher.  found another great restaurant in chandler, az!  top3 reasons why...1- great tasting dish 2- good value  3- atmosphere (location, service, ambience)
5	Love Belly Rubz!! At first little Oscar was timid about me dropping him off but when I came to pick him up he didnt want to quit playing! He has really bad separation anxiety and hates kennels, so it is always worrisome when we try a new groomer. He loved playing and came out looking so handsome! We will be returning to Belly Rubz this week for some more play time and grooming!
5	This place is fantastic. Great food, superior service, gorgeous decor... I had a Breakfast Casserole and a generous side of Cheesy Grits. My girlfriend had the Blue Plate Special which was a frittata.  The Breakfast Casserole is a medley of sausage, roasted vegetables, and potatoes with cheese, topped with a poached egg. There were no overwhelmingly strong or weak flavors, and I didnt see any extra oil in the dish. It came with a side of toast. I chose the marble rye and was disappointed only to see that the butter it came with was a hard stick. The grits were definetly made with milk and butter and had some cheddar cheese sprinkled across the top. The grits were more solid than watery which was a big plus for me, as I prefer my grits closer to the drier end of the spectrum.  After breakfast I ordered a bloody mary at the bar inside and it was spicy and delish, a really good balance of tomato to booze. I liked it a lot. What I liked the most, though, was the really good service and friendly attention we got from our server, the hostess, the bartender, the bar manager, the valet drivers, and even being greeted by the concierge and check-in when we werent even staying at the hotel. I will definetly make it a point to come here again.
4	Had dinner and brunch, not on the same day...the dinner was good, although I thought the mandala masala could have used more flavor.  Brunch was great, tried 2 different tofu scrambles and both were very good.  Service is...lets say uninterested -- its hard to be burdened with angst and chipper.
3	Rolling Hills is two executive courses, and great for a quick cheap round of golf.  Totally not an out of towner destination course, but a nice little local fave of mine.  The front nine is the old course, and is a bit like mini-golfing, a fun distraction.  You even get to hear the occasional strange animal sound from the zoo hidden behind the trees along a couple holes.  The back nine is a newer build, and is way more challenging and scenic.  Either way they both give a fantastic view of the valley, and its a great place to play a quick 9 holes after work in just over an hour Only eaten at the clubhouse once, but both me and my bud liked our burgers, and it sits next to the 9th green, which is great for a little free entertainment.
4	I had my first meal at Mieles last night, and was pleasantly surprised.  I purchased a Groupon to the restaurant a month or so ago, and am glad that I did because otherwise may not have noticed this cute place amongst its neighbors in the strip mall. We started with the brochette, and spent the next 10 minutes raving about how amazing it was.  The tomatoes were crisp and fresh, the chopped garlic was very complimentary, and the oil had a fantastic flavor.  Definitely a good choice.  For dinner I had the spaghetti and meatballs and my boy had the chicken toscana.  Both had a very authentic Italian flavor that accompanies food made with care.  The meatballs were everything I was craving...a little spicy and filled with flavor.  My portion left enough for leftovers, but Brent ate his entire meal.  We both left with a full belly and intentions to return again soon. I have no complaints about the food (delicious!), but docked the restaurant a star for two reasons: 1. The lights are way too bright.  While I appreciate that the restaurant is more casual than some Italian joints Ive been to, a dimmer switch on the overhead lights could do wonders for the atmosphere! 2.  One of my favorite treats at Italian restaurants is bread dipped in tasty olive oil with fresh ground pepper and Parmesan cheese.  The bread is delicious, but the prepackaged butter that accompanied it didnt impress me.  I also would have liked freshly ground Parmesan on my spaghetti. We noticed a lot of pizzas being picked up for takeout, and both thought the bar looked like a cute little place to come have a drink and a bite sometime. Highly recommended and a great way to support a local business owner in Tempe!
4	Sure its walking distance from my house - so I was hoping I would have a new place for my morning tea.   After finally re-opening after the fire on 16th and Bethany Home, I was excited to check out Lucis. The design of the the place is fantastic simple, sexy, a little modern and throw in some retro corner grocery feel.  I was greeted with fun, friendly service, and then left with a great pastry and a tasty ice tea for the road.   They seem to still be working out some kinks since the re-open, but I see it only getting better.  In fact I just got myself excited.  I think I am going to head over there now for my morning snack.
1	Take your money elsewhere, unless youve got kids.  I really try to like this place.  A family member signed me up for the discount card, so Ive been going more often, but I just dont love it.  Its simply ok, but the prices are outrageous.  And the sounds and animatronics are a huge distraction from the so-so food.  The cocktails are alright, but, again, the price is not right.  The ony thing fun about the place for an adult is the gift shop and the light-up cocktail glasses (which cost extra.)  Ive seen a lot of happy families in here though, so I bet its better if you have little ones to bring along.
5	Yum yum yum! Mexican food has to me my favorite type of food and Arriba is for sure at the top of my list for Mexican restaurants! This is a New Mexican style restaurant with lots of hatch green chilies in their dishes. You can also buy them fresh from here by the pound during the month of August.  I have eaten here probably 30+ times and they are always consistent. The chips are always fresh and warm  they serve two different salsas as well as bean dip. All three are the bomb! My favorite item on the menu is the whitesands chimichanga. Do not order this though if you cant handle spicy stuff. but if you are like me, the spicier the better, then go with this!  Everyday they have good lunch specials. I like to go on Thurs because they have chimis for $1.99. For an extra dollar they will smother it with the white sands sauce. What a deal! And on Sunday they have kids day with a clown that makes animal balloons. And best of all, kids eat free!  And if your a beer drinker they have a microbrewery too. Im not a beer drinker though so I cant tell you how good it is. But the margaritas are on point!
4	I was here not too long ago.  The place is cute and when you look at the menu, you cant help but be get excited to go there the first time.  But its one of those places that after trying it the first time, you never have the same excitement to eat there and when debating where to have dinner on a given night in the area, Main Ingredient always comes up as your third choice in case the your first two preferences are either closed or packed.   Meal:  We both had sandwiches and a side of the mac and cheese.  I cant remember what local beers we had, but they were excellent.  They have a terrific beer selection. Taste:  There were many, many delicious choices on the menu and sadly, the food is not as appealing as billed on the menu.  Its still good, but it doesnt live up to the hype.  7 out of 10. Value: I thought the prices and potions were very and reasonable, but the real value is in their happy hour specials. 4 out of 5. Service/Cleanliness:  Our server was very attentive, silly and friendly.  Her recommendation for craft beer was dead on.  9 out of 10. Atmosphere:  I hate to repeat what others have said, but the atmosphere is a perfect place to chill out at.  I recommend this a top place for "Friday Afternoon Drinking Club".  5 out of 5. Overall:  If you are in the area, you should give it a shot.  I think the next time I visit, it will be just for a few drinks and an appetizer.  25 out of 30 points, 4 out of 5 stars.
4	I went here again when I got back to Phoenix after being gone for six months. This is one of my moms favorite places to eat and I can understand why. The ravioli and the miso soup are so delicious! The wine was ok and I would recommend one of their elixirs over an alcohol beverage. Still a pretty delicious place to go in Phoenix.
3	This place isnt all that but there food is OK.  There are better Chinese options for the price (try Chinese Cultural Center restaurants).  The restaurant itself is well furnished and clean but I cant get over the fact that people rave about this place.
5	So freaking good.  The drinks are great too.  Ask for "the icon" not on menu, but very good! Love everything I had there!  Service is great and food is absolutely delicious!  Wish I lived closer!
5	Another excellent find in Scottsdale.  The service is wonderful and the food is extremely flavorful with good size portions.  The sea scallops and herb chicken are highly recommended.
4	I do enjoy this coffee shop, though admittedly it has largely subscribed to bohemian bloodletting since emerging from the former Willo House. They still present photographs, paintings, sculptures and more throughout the cafe, most, if not all, for sale. The clientele has changed, as has the interior. Regardless, its still a nice place for coffee. For those who havent been, its set in an old house on the southeast corner of 3rd Avenue and McDowell. Personally, one of my favorite activities is to start here for coffee and take a walking tour in the area. Its one of the few neighborhoods in Phoenix with historic homes from the 1920s, which seem to be untouched by the authoritarian overlords of homeowners associations so popular in suburbs. I could be wrong, as I dont live in the area. But, to stay on topic, the menu is a bit pricey but Hob Nobs has retained the Willo Houses cozy, neighborly feel, though yes, over a few short years it transitioned from hippie to yuppie.
4	Thai Basil is just delicious! I love Thai food but i try not t drag the bf along too much since he has not yet found a Thai place that has a dish he really loves but that changes since bringing him here ! WHOOP WHOOP!   Really good and quick service for either eating in or taking to go ( we have done both). He is in love right now with their chow mein and i as always am a big fan of Pad Thai.  their pad Thai is not as spicy as other places i have been which is ok considering i can spice it up myself if necessary. only downfall for me is i am not a fan t all of their sweet and sour pork which is a big deal for me, since next to Pad Thai that is definitely a second.   Their chicken sa tay and spring rolls are really good as well! Cheap!
3	My sis recommend this place for our weekly dinner. We shared on of the large appetizer platters (hummus, baba ganoush, tabouli and dolmades and two pitas). Very good and perfect for a light dinner. I would have to say the best thing was the fresh lemonade...wow! If you like tart youll love this.  I thought overall the service was great. Not only was our waitress extremely attentive but the manager stopped by to make sure we were enjoying our food I give The Flaming Kabob 3 stars!
4	Never been in - but I get pizza delivered from them now and then. I am a New Yorker and to call me a pizza snob probably doesnt go far enough. The crust is crispy, thin, and foldable, the outside edges, crispy and bubbly. Great mozzarella. I have never been disappointed by a topping. A little greasy, as it should be; it reminds me of NY pizza, and thats a big compliment coming from me. We dont have a Rays in Central Phoenix... but we do have Mamma Mias.  Yo! Tony! You make a good pizza.
5	I am not usually a fan of botanical gardens. They seem too precious, too "perfect" to be of much interest. And, lets face it, flowers and plants are beautiful things, but when you pay to look at them in neat rows, something is lost. That said, Desert Botanical Gardens is an exception to this garden cynic. Many of these cacti look like they are from another planet, like something you would see in a sci-fi film and say, "wow, its too bad those crazy plants dont exist." They sprawl out on the ground, weaving and turning every which way, or compose huge bizarre formations high off the ground. I never knew such bizarre life forms existed, or that some cacti look like trees. The gardens are full of windy paths where one is also likely to find a family of quail, lizards, or a jackrabbit or two. Various species of bird can be seen here as well, especially at dusk. I especially love watching the birds fly in and out of nests theyve made in the upper arms of cacti. This place never grows old. Its a great introduction to the desert for people from out of town, and because the cacti have been collected from around the world, a cool botany lesson for us all here.
5	Thanks fellow yelpers for brining us to Four Peaks!  My husband and I were stuck in Phoenix for the night and needed a place for dinner.  Ironically we ended up at Four Peaks (a Vikings bar) on our way back home to Minnesota.   My husband loves beer (brews a ton of his own) and especially enjoyed the beer sampler. Trying 10 beers for around $9, yes please!  I dont really love beer so I had a cider and it was exactly what I needed.  For dinner I had the turkey burger with fries.  The turkey burger was standard but the fries were awesome.  I think it was the beer batter.  My husband go the carne adovada and he raved.  I think he may try to convince me to fly back to Phoenix just for that dish! The atmosphere was also great.  It was very laid back and fun to be able to sit amongst the beer being made.   I highly recommend Four Peaks whether you are a Phoenix native or otherwise!
4	We went over for dinner- had the spring rolls, chicken curry, and lemongrass chicken. The spring rolls and lemongrass chicken were about a 3 star, but the chicken curry was really good and made up for the others. We also had the coconut water, which was fresh. Prices were reasonable we paid around $30.
2	Ive been here a few times now and I would say it is decent, slightly overpriced Mexican food. Their regular dishes are just OK. I have had their tacos and enchiladas and prefer Arribas (right next door) or Carlos Obriens, just down the street. There is even some mom and pop place by my apartments that equates to the quality and taste.  What I like about Los Olivos is their Nachos. OMG this thing is huge. Imagine a large pizza in your head and then replace that image with the same size plate of nachos. I am not even kidding. Four or more people could munch on this. They do it exactly how I like it too, lots of cheese, tomatoes, jalapenos, sour cream, and guacamole. YUM  That is what has been keeping me coming back, but after the other night I feel I am sure to find somewhere whose nachos make me just as happy.  Every time I have been here, it has been dead. And last time I came at prime dinner time. Then why is the service so awful? This kid kept coming up to our table and trying to take things. We werent even half way done with our nachos when he asked while Im in MID BITE "are you finished with that" not only asking but reaching his hand to grab the plate! And this happened repeatedly as we tried to finish our food. I dont know if they wanted us out of there or what. And then for someone who was so "attentive" I waited for 5-10 minutes for a drink refill (make the glasses clear and it wont be so hard to tell if I need more)  My friend and I left full but irritated. If I thought the quality of service was a one time thing I wouldnt even put this review up...but the fact of the matter is when you are paying for overpriced Mexican food in North Scottsdale, it isnt as if your options are slim.  My advice, go next door to Arribas. Good food and GREAT service!
5	01/04/2012 I thank Yelp and ATC for giving me the great opportunity to experience a terrific performance of "Daddy Long Legs," ATCs first musical production, at The Herberger Theater tonight!  The two-actor (Megan McGinnis and Robert Adelman Hancock) musical, plus the invisible, but great assets, the orchestra and sound crew, entertained and amazed me w/ their execution of a well-written body of work.  It had comedy, romance, deception, and sorrow, to name a few... whats not to like?  Truly enjoyed McGinnis impeccable timing, as well.  It is sad that many people pass up the opportunity to watch live theater due to the higher ticket fees, and I cannot fault them-- whats easier to bear: $37 per person plus $3 parking fee, which you may buy at the box office prior to attending the show, or $10 and free parking at the movies (well, at least when youre NOT catching one in downtown PHX)?  However, when you do decide to place the financial investment, you will almost always be rewarded w/ a highly-memorable night, believe you me!   I had a wonderful time, and I would definitely recommend "Daddy Long Legs" to anyone who enjoys great acting and music!  (Much thanks to McGinnis and Hancock for their lovely harmonies-- I cherished them!)
4	In spite of being on the corner of 44th and Camelback it does a good job of insulating you from the traffic and taking you some place else, in this case our dear Communist neighbors to the South.  I like the sampler because it allows you to enjoy the finest island interpretations of pork, beef, and chicken.  Also, no meal is complete without going bananas for the ....well, tostones. You gotta hand it to those Castro brothers.  They forcefully preside over a country that has a pretty great national cuisine.  Viva La Revolucion!
1	Disgusting!  Had a Groupon so my daughter and I tried it out.  Very outdated and gaudy 80s style interior made me feel like I was in an episode of Sopranos.  The food itself was pretty bad.  We ordered pretty simple dishes but they just had no flavor at all!  After trying it out Im positive all the good reviews on here are employees or owners creating them.
2	I dont often review places on Yelp because of the time commitment and because usually I am just looking for a good bite to eat. This time, though I feel I should if not to balance the ridiculous number of 4 and 5 stars bouncing around for this place. The food was decent, and the atmosphere OK but seriously, how can this place cost as much as it does ($60+ for two people eating light)?? And how are people fawning all over it? I dont like to complain about a good meal, and indeed this meal was good but I cant seem to justify the cost as compared to most any other place I have tried in Phoenix that would be considered in St. Francis class.  I ordered a Hearts of Romaine Salad and a bowl of cauliflower soup. I shared a plate of the baked goat cheese with my guest. Not one of these dishes would have tasted much different had I made them myself from ingredients at the Public Market. Indeed, I have had cauliflower soup at the market that tasted just as good for a fraction of the price. The service was good, I will say, and for that I would offer a higher rating. But the general ambiance of pretension was more than I could justify, again for a meal I feel like I have had 100 times before.  In the end I guess I would say if they would knock about $10 off of each plate, and cut some of the pretentious attitude, I would probably be offering a much  better review.  I am not planning a return anytime soon.
3	Okay, so I like Canteen and all, but dear Lord, lets turn that music down a notch! These guys have a great happy hour, but I realistically wouldnt come here if it werent for that. I quite enjoy the small bites baby back ribs - the portions are so small, but since they are half price during happy hour, I get two orders! Im not a big fan of Tequila, but I know they have a big selection (obviously). I really like the atmosphere here, and the service has always been good. I may or may not come back, but well see. Three solid stars from me.
4	Always reliably good.  Great beer selection as well as fabulous "bitch fizz" (ciders, etc.) and cocktails.  Their pizza is outstanding AND they have a healthy menu.  I generally steer clear of chains but this is an exception.
2	This gas station is like the bermuda triangle of gas stations! I came here w/ a friend on a first friday, she was DDing and i was her passenger "and i ride and i ride i ride through the citys backside.." until we eventually reached E and desperatly needed petrol. Like a suspicious siren this little green long necked demon sang to us, luring us in w/ his dino siren song. As we pulled in a car was broken down near the entrance and several dudes were milling around the engine, hood propped open, pondering their next move. I grimaced at their misfortune. We filled up, i strolled inside to pay for my friend Kathys gas and get some munchies. I walk back out to her car and pump her gas, we chat and make jokes. All the while i notice Kathy is so sketched out, ( a case of white girl from the burbs out of her comfort zone late at night down town). Gas pumped check. We climb back in, she turns the key in the ignition, and dead silence. A mere clicking and then nothing. SSSHHHIIIIIIITTTT. she starts panicking, i can only help but laugh at our misfortune. Two cars in the same gas station broken down. Our situation only seemed more dire as time passed, and each car that came to Sinclair refused to help us, or just shirked us off w/ some lame excuse. It was only until two young mexican teenagers came to our rescue that we were able to move. the other car had managed to start up, and the boys asked the men in spanish if they could give us a jump, reluctantly they agreed. The Mexican men swung their beater over towards Kathys engine and we hooked up the cables and...LIFE! we said our thank yous and shook hands, and then brought the teens back to their homes, much to the protest of my scared white girl associate.  Had it not been for those wonderful people wed have been stranded at the Bermuda Sinclair possibly till day break.
1	The service here was awful, we waited patiently for over 15 minutes for our server to come by our table. Finally a hostess came by and noticed nobody was helping us and got us drinks. Another 15 minutes roll by and finally our server decides to make an appearance saying "have you guys decided yet on what you want?", uhh yeah! Overall, service was poor and food was just okay. Wont be going back.
4	Finally, a pizza place that satisfies the individual pizza taste buds of my family! We ordered the Rockys Philly Steak Pizza along with a cheese pizza and both were delicious! Everyone left happy.
4	This place is right up my alley. Smithwicks on tap- check Awesome fish & chips (award-winning for a good reason)- check Good pub vibe accompanied by live music- check A nice soccer following (the unofficial bar for Glasgow Celtic supporters- not my club, but good enough)- check Ill go with 4 & 1/4 stars.
5	After driving down a teeny dimly lit road and coming across what looked like a medical office building in the 60s, my husband and I found the amazing Fuego Bistro. We had a perfect meal there. Amazing ambiance, twinkly lights in the courtyard, live musician. Great wine. Food was so unique and delicious- Id describe it as Southern-Spanish fusion. This meal was the highlight of our trip to Phoenix.  If you live in Phoenix, you have no excuse to not come here. I live in Chicago and Im sure Ill be back.
4	The meat and bread is so fresh that it makes Mr. Goodcents my number one sub place to hit up when in the mood for a sub
4	Been dining here about a year and still trying diff things from the menu and all have been good. I dont think the heat is unedible even the hottest plates are just "good" hot.
4	As a travel consultant for cre8adventures.com, we came away impressed. This is a moderately priced getaway of unquestionable value. For travelers seeking style in an in-town locale, this chic desert retreat may currently fall behind the Mondrian, but it easily surpasses Chaparral Suites next door. The staff is showing off its Kimpton training, and the service standards were very welcome. This hotel gets high marks on all fronts. Taggia, the hotels new restaurant, is a stylish Italian venue with a unique Ligurian-anchored menu that features fresh seafood and creative traditionally inspired dishes. A large kiva-style fireplace warms the alfresco section, and waterfalls surround it. The only downside is that Kimpton hasnt fully finished up on the room makeovers yet. Compared with Kimptons usual attention to room furnishings and design, these digs are mild-mannered. The older patterned carpeting was disappointing. Still Kimpton has done an admirable and feverish job at making over this property. Kudos.
4	I really love Pita Jungle.  My first experience was at the one downtown, and now, I have to get my fix.  I found this location since it is close to my home, and wanted to check it out. Upon entering, I was pleased with the location.  Well decorated, clean, good lighting, ample seating.  I was greated by the hostess, and sat at the bar.  The place was pretty busy, and I was by myself.  I was greeted in a quick manner by a nice server from behind the bar.  I took a moment to review my menu, and decided to skip a full meal and go for some lentil soup. Now, here is where things get dicey.  I wont hold it against Pita Jungle, but I have to put this in the review.  First, after being seated, I noticed that it was a little toasty in there.  I think they could have turned up the A/C.  I am sure if I had been drinking, I probably would have broken a slight sweat, as it was warm in here.   Secondly, after I ordered my lentil soup, it took what seemed like forever to get it.  I did not time it with a stop watch, but it took a long time for just a bowl of soup.  Secondly, when I did get the lentil soup, I didnt care for it.  It looked kinda gross and didnt taste all that great.  And, in case you were wondering, NO, I didnt send it back or complain.  I was to tired and didnt feel like being a sourpuss. The other problem that I experienced, was the server girl brought out my check WAY before I was ever served my food.  I hate that!  At least bring my bill with my food, not before! Aside from that, I dig this place.
3	I only go here when my little cousin is in town and he adores this place. My cousin is 4 years old and obsessed with trains so he loves the small train display, the stationary trains you can walk through and the little train that goes around the park that you can ride on. A definite place to go with little kids especially if they like the trains.
3	I really wanted to fall madly in love with this place, I mean, a British themed pub in Heritage Square? So promising.  As you walk in, the bartender is standing behind in an elaborate wooden bar structure. This made me think publican instead of bartender (as in "Mate, Ill take a pint and dya have any rooms available?"), which is probably the idea. As there was nice selection of draught beers, we walked around to the bar to the right and ordered a couple of pints. I ordered a Boddingtons, my friend ordered a Stateside micro brew. (Would have been nice if they had Old Peculiar on tap, but you cant have everything.)  Due to the combination of things cooking in the kitchen, it smelled a bit like my grandmas house. This prompted us to make a beeline for the patio decorated with super-heavy wood furniture. I assume this is to discourage thieves from selling their tables and chairs on the black market. Smart. The piped-in music selection that night was a bit off-putting, in fact, one of the other patrons commented on it as well. It appeared to be a satellite radio station that specialized in 80s hits like Wham! and Depeche Mode. I guess George Michael and David Gahan ARE British. Indeed! Wikipedia just informed me that "Dave Gahan (born May 9, 1962 in Epping, Essex, England) is the baritone lead singer for the English electronic band Depeche Mode, and is also an accomplished solo artist." Now I feel better.  There are many cozy nooks in this place, so that would be a good thing if you wanted to have some one-on-one time. They were also playing football (soccer) on the flat screens, so should make some team scarf-wearing Brit ex-pats in the Valley very happy. Will I be back to try the food? Probably at some point. But, for another round of drinks, I think Ill wait for a Friday or Saturday night when its hopping.
4	With a name like "The Lodge", I thought I was going to an old dirty restaurant with some of the neighborhood locals. We went here after a soccer game two weeks ago, and I have to say, I thought I was going to be disappointed. I expected greasy food, and grimy scenery. This was not the case, although the scenery was mildly disturbing as most of the decor included some dearly departed wildlife. I had a great sandwich I believe called the healthy choice, that was supposedly was healthy? It came on this great thick toasted buttery whole grain bread, egg whites, hollindase sauce, tomato and avocado. It was one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. I dont think it was a calorie saver by any means but I am sure it was just the idea it was made with healthier ingredients. For a lodge, this was a terrific restaurant, and yes this is a compliment by far, joking aside, as you remember my thoughts of what a lodge was all about. This is nothing like the local VFW. The only other scary part was this jerk at the bar decided to take his shirt off, and throw it across the room. And ladies, no, this was definitely not a pretty sight nor was it funny. They need to enforce the shirt and shoes required law here otherwise it will earn a lodgey reputation from me. Luckily, as this ghastly sight appeared, we quickly disappeared on our way home.
5	Im not going to lie - I indulged in fantasies about Howard Roark during the course of my 90-minute Insights tour. His spirit and convictions were brought to life by FLW and being in this incredible complex where he lived, worked and taught was indescribably cool.  The tour takes you around the property and through many of the rooms, restored to various periods of Franks life. I was a bit dismayed at the disrepair some of the rooms are in, so I spent money in the gift shop hoping it will go to repairing some sad looking chairs and windowpanes.   Overall, the tour guides are genius at describing and making you feel like youre seeing things through FLWs eyes with his vision on architecture and lifestyle.  This is not to be missed!
5	I got a coupon at a past Yelp event to try them out and Im SO glad I did!  Massage Envy really exceeded my wildest expectations for a chain that offers affordable rates for massage therapy.  I was pleasantly surprised by the level of expertise and professionalism that I experienced! My massage therapist was Dannie and she worked through my trigger points and loosened my tight muscles with an intuition that I have rarely experienced. I highly recommend this place and hope to return soon!
4	I didnt pay much attention to this place for several years.  Passed it many times, just didnt catch my eye enough for me to remember it on those nights when I desperately try to think of some new place to try. Ive since been here twice (over about a 3 month time span), and I really love it.  First time, had great food (all server recommendations - although he disappeared prior to arrival of meal, seemed to be doing side work so he could bolt out).  Great although somewhat minimal service for the second half of our dinner, former waiter did not say he was leaving, we sat for a little while before someone new arrived.  Ambiance and company made it barely noticeable.   Personally, I dont care as long as I get good service.  Were not family, I dont need an apology or heartfelt goodbye.  The garlic app - what it is called? - your server will know, its probably their most popular dish, it is AMAZING.  Order this unless you hate garlic or are on a diet.  I consider myself a good cook, but I would leave this up to Richardsons.  As I write this I realize the whole reason for my review is that dish, because I dont remember anything else I had.  Stopped by for drinks the second time, ended up ordering a pizza, expected little since it didnt mesh with the menu, it was really quite good.  Bartender was great (I think he was actually the take-over waiter from my previous visit).  Very cozy place, if you come later or are are willing to wait, you can get a private table in a cave like nook.  The place is not cheap, comparative to other finer dining establishments.  Overall, a lively but romantic place with character, good food, and decent service.
3	Food is just ok, but the problem is its way overpriced! I mean $9 for loco moco? Outrageous!
1	I was searching for a unique item to give as a Thank You gift and I stopped by Practical Art over the Labor Day weekend after viewing some items on their website.  I was extremely under underwhelmed by the service I received and do not plan on returning.   When I arrived the young woman behind the counter was having a personal conversation with an acquaintance.  Besides the employee and her conversation buddy the store was empty.  I spent about ten minutes looking around and the young woman did not have the common courtesy to acknowledge me with a simple "Hello", even as I was viewing items directly in front of the counter.  When I was leaving the store she did break long enough to say "Bye". I believe it is very important to support local business but I will not spend my money here.  I did find several items I wanted to buy and made note of the artist. I have done the extra leg work to reach out to them to find out how to purchase their items through other channels.  I do not feel they should miss a sale due to the sub par customer service at this location.
3	the food here is deeee-licious. i like the decor, the ambiance, the menu, the waitstaff. however, i hate the feeling that im being some trendy little scottsdale frou-frou by eating here. the salads are totally inventive and yummy, but a little on the sweet side. i loooooooooooove that you can add an egg (genius!!!) and fresh garlic to your pizza. i adore the fresh and homemade ingredients, and i really like the cute little neighborhood-eatery feel. eating here makes me feel as if im in a bigger city than phx.  LGO is on the pricey side, and definitely caters to those who want to eat gourmet/designer pizza. however, taste wins out with all the fantastic and fresh toppings. and if you ever get sick of franchise restaurants a la CPK, LGO is a great alternative.
4	My boyfriend just reviewed this place and although we have never  been here together - I thought that I might chime in as well. I really enjoyed this little burger place.  It makes eating a burger seem fancy in a very modern setting.  I really LIKE the sweet potato french fries....Mmmmm!
3	1. Good Customer Service 2. Clean Atmosphere 3. Good Margaritas 4. YUMMIE Carna Asada Burrito
5	I am proud to say that I sent Kristin S. here for her awesome hair transformation (8 inches is a lot, girl!) I just had my second hair cut here today, and I was just as happy this time as I was the first time around. First of all, the service is top notch - they take care of you quickly, kindly and enthusiastically. They are not snobby, which is a welcome relief when living in Scottsdale. I have always felt welcome and comfortable here.  Moreover, the prices are amazing! I have very easy and basic hair, and they charge me $45 for a hair cut - if you want to spend more, you certainly can, but I am fine with the "stylist" level (who charges $45). In Tampa I paid more like $65, but I much prefer Par Exsalonce. This place is a well oiled machine, and they know how to run a salon. They carry B&B products, which are fun every once in a while. I really love this place and will not look for another hair place in the Valley. This place knows how to treat customers, style hair and create a pleasant experience. The Market Street location is a bonus, too, because you can even do some damage shopping when you bounce out with your new do.
5	note: the 5 stars im giving this place is for their happy hour menu, not the regular menu. if you order off the regular menu no amount of advice can help you. M&S has to have one of the best happy hours in the world, aside from Spearmint Rhino. $3 drafts and a rotating $2 bar food menu, such as 1/2 lb. burger with fries, hot wings, fish tacos, beef taquitos, etc. dont order the fish chilli though, it tastes like A1 sauce. they got a lot of winners on tap, like kiltlifter, guinness, bass, fat tire, pyramid hefe, etc. happy hour is from 3p-6p and then again from 9p-11p, which is pure genius. make sure you get your parking ticket balidated, because the Eritrean girl in the parking garage will make you go back in the restaurant and get that joint stamped if you forget. BUZZKILL.
5	Have you ever eaten somewhere and just cant get the craving out of your head and you have to go back!  This is the place that does it to me.  Ive decided I need to try everything on their menu! You have to try the Roasted Turkey and Stuffing it is to DIE for!  And the mac n cheese  so yummy.    Ive also had the Prosciutto and Fig Jam sandwich and I thought I had died and gone to heaven.  I had that with fruit which was good.   Guess where Im going for lunch... yeah there because I need it after doing this review.  :-)   Oh and before I forget... When the weather is nice sit out side!  You will love it.
4	Stopped by for a quick bite on a Saturday afternoon. Did not realize that the place had just opened (or at it appeared that way). Quite crowded with patrons, a bubble machine, and a DJ.  It was bit loud with all the commotion, but still within reason. The menu is compact, but offered all the usual suspects. I went for the Pulled Pork sandwich with a side of cole slaw. I dumped the cole slaw on top of the pork and went to town on the sandwich. Meat was moist and smoky. The sauce had a hint of of kick. Very tasty. The service was a bit slow, but the place was pretty much full up so I expected it to take a bit of time. Good joint. Would return.
2	Not exactly what I would call a great place to eat. If you want to take your teenager out for a shake or ice cream you may enjoy it :)
4	Great drinks!!! Good atmosphere Fantastic food (the bbq chicken pizza is a must) Nice people to conversate with What is not to like? Oh yes, the creepy guy that kept staring at me. Oh well, he will not be there next time I go...I hope :)
3	As a fairly new connoisseur of Greek food, this place is pretty good. I like their pita a lot, and the fire feta is quite addicting.  The salad and rice arent anything to write home about, and Im not crazy about the tzaziki sauce here (love it other places)... the street gyros were decent, and the tea that they serve here is delicious when mixed with pink lemonade. I wouldnt go out of my way to come here, but Ill be back when Im in the hood.
5	short leash is awesome! we tried the sample platter and they delivered it to us inside the bar. we were also given an additional sample tray to try for free. everything was delicious and had a very unique take on a common american snack.  I cant wait until they come back!
5	Visited the phoenix public market - open air market - farmers market they have on saturday mornings and decided to give mojo bowl a try! They are at the market for food truck fridays also. Check out their website for their usual schedule. They can take cash or credit (with square). I tried their strawberry banana smoothie and my wife had the Funky Monkey (peanut butter / chocolate blend). They were both great quality with fresh ingrediants. They serve salads, yogurt parfaits, and soup also (which I didnt try) but Ive heard their smoothies was where they shine and they did not dissapoint. Give them a try, at $5.00 for a 24 oz smoothie, you cant really complain about the price - its basically a meal itself.
3	Service - 5 stars (which is so rare). Food 2.5 stars.  My husband and I are a little picky when it comes to steaks (we eat Mortons and Mastros) but we wanted to try a new steakplace while visiting Phoenix and Durants had great reviews.  When you get to the restaurant, you walk through the kitchen (pretty cool to see everything) then youre greeted by the host. We came for a pretty early dinner and literally every single person - host, kitchen staff, waiter/waitresses greeted us. The decor is pretty cool - kind of burlesque-ish, all walls are a deep red, there are huge vases of roses everywhere. Our waiter Fred was awesome!! Very friendly and professional.  I had their vegetable beef soup (good but salty) and my husband had house salad. I ordered the trout with lemon caper sauce which was very bland. My husband had rib-eye and it was also bland which was surprising. Their dessert - trio creme brulee - was the best part of the meal! So from this meal we decided if we want steak, were sticking with our usual Mortons.
4	Had an outstanding lunch here.  The view is amazing, their cheese fondue dip was delicious, and they serve up a tasty burger. I definitely recommend it and would come back in a heartbeat on my next visit to Phoenix.
5	Hybrid class!! Did it a few years back and to this day its the best workout Ive ever had. Will be going back FOR SURE
3	Ive swung into Echo a few times and havent ever had a bad cup of coffee. The cappuccino is pretty solid and the zucchini bread I had for breakfast one day was a win. If I recall correctly it came in a cute little box too. For some reason Ive never been able to feel relaxed and at home enough to chill and enjoy an afternoon or evening there. Not sure why, but just havent.
5	Love this place! Wish we had one here in CA. Great vibe once you walk through that door. Fantastic drinks and goodies!!
4	Well, this is where I got my iPad, and I am hooked of all Apple products.  Yes, they are expensive, but they are so cool.  I am amazed to see little kids playing with the iPads and computers, I am sure they are a lot more tech savvy than me.
4	I finally made it to this place after hearing nothing but great reviews from others.  Now I can see why it is held in such high regard.  If you are a fan of Paradise Bakery, this place is better...hands down.  At first glance, it appears to be identical, but on closer look it wins in two important categories.  First, the vast menu blows away the Paradise selection of "like 3 items"  There are countless sandwhiches, salads, soups and deserts.  Second of all, the prices are incredible.  It is very affordable for the quality and quantity of food.  Finally, the food is excellent.   Not that I have a problem with Paradise, but given the choice, Wildflower wins every time..
3	The best example North Scottsdale has of traditional Phoenix sonoran mexican food.  Los Olivos restaurants have been around forever - at least since the 60s.  The food is great if not fancy, and the place is pretty free of gimmicks.  You can get your fix of cheese crisps (aka quesadillas for you CA transplants), deep fried tacos, chimichangas, combination plates with so much sauce and cheese you cant tell whats underneath but it all works together to taste so good.  Los Olivos still plops down the free chips and salsa right when you sit down so youre good an full when that combo plate comes and glad for it.  The atmosphere is more like a nice mexican diner than mexican cantina and service is solid. They often have mariachis playing on weekend nights.  Margaritas arent great, but the beer is cold.  Dont bother with dessert.  Cheap eats for all the food, especially since you wont be hungry for another 24 hours.  If youre in North Scottsdale and in the mood for traditional Phoenix style mexican food, Los Olivos is a great choice.
4	Very good food! We ate some shrimp tacos and macaroni and cheese. They split our tacos up for us and didnt charge for it...the portions were great too! Our server was friendly as well. Would definitely return!
5	When I moved to the Valley, our first place was a rental in Old Town.  The previous tenant/owner generously left a bunch of take-out menus for nearby restaurants.  Defalcos was one of them.  But not being a fan of the sandwich, it took me four years and a move to actually go in.  What a fool I was.  This place is fantastic!   First off, its not just a deli, its an Italian market.  Had I actually read the full name of the place, I might have known that.  Its also got a somewhat extensive selection of wine available for purchase.  So now weve moved from a deli, to a grocer, to a wine shop.  Dont forget the pasta dishes and the pastry, too.   My fave sandwich is the tomato, mozz, and basil on a sub roll with olive oil and balsamic.  Simple, yet perfection.  Im a huge fan of those sub rolls by the way.  Crusty on the outside, but not so crusty that it makes a big mess every time you take a bite, yet soft and chewy on the inside.  Its always about the bread for me.  Great selection of prepared salads in the deli as well.  One of the best red potato salads Ive had in a long time. It certainly wont take me another four years to go back.  I think Ive been there just about every week in the last month!
5	Being a former band nerd in high school, so much nostalgia kicked in upon entering the museum. I saw all the instruments I was familiar with in high school, and many others that I wasnt familiar with (and learned much about).  They supply you with headphones and a wireless receiver that plays the audio/video of the different sections you walk into. Each plays a sample of what the instruments sound like and some give detailed history on the instrument. Very enlightening experience. Best Part IMO: They have a room where you get to test random instruments to your hearts content! I really wanted to go ham on the gong but there was a sign that said something along the lines of "do not hit the gong repeatedly". I was disappoint... but otherwise many other instruments in there kept me occupied for awhile (xylophone, conga, harp, etc) Its not an arm and a leg to get inside, and this place has something for everybody. Youre sure to spend a few hours enjoying yourself here. If youre going to do anything in Phoenix, this is one of the spots you should definitely check out.
4	I am not as enthusiastic about the Cornish Pasty Company as some, but if you are looking for this type of place to eat, you will probably enjoy the experience. A Pasty is basically a turnover; at Cornish Pasty Company, it is a very big turnover.  One is a meal.  Here they precook them until they are almost done, then finish them when you order.  This process introduces a drying effect that detracts from the product.  They do serve a sauce with each pasty, and as the sauces we tried were quite good, you can use the sauce to counteract the dryness. When all is said and done, the pastys are tasty.  But not knock-your-socks-off great. The atmosphere at Cornish Pasty Company is cramped and noisy.  It seems more like a college hangout than a restaurant, and this is not surprising because it is a college hangout, but one where the quality of the food has attracted a wider clientele.  If you like this kind of atmosphere, you will be right at home at one of the few small tables or at the bar.  I prefer the bar. Prices are low (typically about $9 for a pasty), considering the size of the meal. Hints: 1.  It is always crowded.  Try to come at an off hour, like 4:30 on a weekday. 2.  Skip the very average salads and the oven chips (dry, tasteless), and probably the other appetisers.  Just get a pasty.  If you are an abnormally big eater, follow it up with a dessert pasty. 3.  It is a bit hard to find.  Turn North on Hardy from University to find the Cornish Pasty Company in a small shopping center hidden by a large gas station.
5	I had other piercings done here and then went out of state and got my nose pierced with a friend and when i got back I was having problems with it. I went in and talked to them and they changed out the stud for me gave me a discount on the jewelry and were really fun, friendly, professional and very informative. This place is top notch. Wont go to another place for my piercings again! No way! It is very clean, and these guys know their stuff! Really impressed...I could go on and on! I wont get my jewelry anywhere else either...they have a a great variety and if they dont have something you want they order it, easy peasy. Love it!
5	My mother and I were actually getting out of the car to go to Streets of New York next door when she smelled the Mexican food and suggested we try Robertos instead.  That should tell you what you need to know right there. Its a hole in the wall place for sure, and leaves much to be desired visually, but the staff was exceptionally pleasant and the tables were clean.  If youre looking for fine dining, this isnt your place.  At $7-$10 for an entree, though, it was delicious. Beans, rice, and chips were pretty standard, but the salsa, fish taco, and shredded beef tostada were very flavorful.  The food tastes homemade, and in this case, thats a good thing. This place was also featured on TLCs Diners and Drive-ins show back in the day.  One of Anthems best kept secrets.  Ill be back!
5	Great surprise-- I have driven by this place several times-- food was excellent-- I had the Enchantment platter-- just the right amount of heat without being overwhelming- Cool cave-like atmosphere inside and fun patio area-- I will definitely be back and bring out of towners
1	Would have to agree with Rana A below... I think she said it best Actually, I had several folks tell me this place was lousy before I went... it even fell below my already low expectations... Given that I just left the real Barcelona (in Spain)- part of me was truly crying inside that night. OK, I gotta admit- everytime I tell someone I was just in Barcelona (the city) and they say "you mean the one in Scottsdale" there is a part of me that wants to just pack my bags and fly back...
5	A real gem!
5	These are the best, most consistent donuts in the valley.  I was always a fan of the Chandler location, so I tried this location as soon as it opened.  I was pleased that the donuts were as fresh and as varied as the other location. I dont care if people go to dunkin for the coffee..a donut shop is about the donuts, and I havent yet had any donuts in the valley in the same league as BoSa.
3	I visited on high reviews.  I think its a little over-rated, but good none the less.  My burger was a bit overcooked, food was overpriced but the service was top notch.  Great service, exciting atmosphere (although a bit cramped).  I would go again with hopes of a better burger.
5	The mall of malls, for sure! So many designer boutiques, so little time! On this trip, I was given the utmost in attention from the fabulous women at the Fossil store....what fun they were! I enjoyed a smoked chicken & black bean salad @ Z Tejas next and the service was excellent. I then perused the new styles at Aqua before finding a great pair of shades at Solstice = shoppers bliss :) This review is a bit late; I visited the center on 1/27/12 - and Ill be back :)
5	Ive been using mineral makeup for a couple years now and Bare Escentuals is the best in my experience. You can order their stuff online as well and its free shipping after a certain amount, but I like being able to ask questions and compare things side by side before I buy, and the salesgirls are always really helpful with that. Once I find a product Im loyal to, then I do the online thing. This stuff just feels much better on your skin and doesnt clog your pores. It seems like an initially pricey investment when youre first getting started, but mineral make-up keeps much better and I can use less of it to achieve the effects I want.
4	Excellent Park!  As metropolitan areas go, Phoenix maintains a higher sense of civic duty than most towns, and that is reflected in its parks systems.  White Tanks ranks in my TOP TEN list easily above #5.  It is HUGE.  It is DIVERSE.  It has EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES.  Bathrooms are CLEAN.  And they have LOTS of EVENTS! Check out the calendar of events at their web page! http://www.maricopa.gov/parks/white_tank/
5	Along with Bliss, FEZ is another one of my fav brunch spots. They have $3 specialty drinks (mimosas, bloody marys, bellinis...). The service is always quick and the servers are always attentive and very patient with my ridiculous modifications. They have a drink called a "g-spot" and it is fresh grapefruit, grapefruit juice, ruby red vodka and soda. It is unbelievable and on thursdays they are $3 (i think) The menu is different with kasras and stylish burgers but somehow we always fill up on the appetizers. The cheese fondue and the little pyllo pockets are my favs. Ive never been disappointed at FEZ and I absolutely will continue to recommend it and go back! (Thanks thomas for the corrections!)
3	For such a small space, Stinkweeds definitely does a good job of packing as much variety as they can in their store. As far as record stores go, theyve got a pretty decent collection in both CDs and vinyl. My only qualm with this place is that they tend to only carry newer stuff or the more popular titles of indie genres. If youre like me and like to peruse through older and hard-to-find collections, be sure to check out Tracks in Wax a few blocks down the street on Central. That being said, this is definitely a place youll want to drop into. Their selection of concert/music video DVDs is pretty solid as is what their magazine stand has to offer. Sure, its no Amoeba but its the next best thing.
2	Why Meh?    The state of repair on the games made this a voyage of discovery, e.g, with a 2 hour unlimited card I could work out which machines actually worked:)  .Id rather have a downed machine than something that is unplayable but maybe Im just unlucky that I hit the 4/5 games with issues in my first plays.  End Ghost Recon.. gun on left wont hold steady target  jumps all over.  Opposite of it : Need for speed Carbon has a intermittent brake pedal which wont let the car go too fast) Mechwarrior 4/ Beach-head 2000 unit.. Hideously slow , jumping frames, jerking hydraulics, broke after playing.  Cant get 8 way direction on left side of tekken 5  Gave up and played Galaga after that:) Yeah left / right fire that works:/ Variety is lacklustre, Shoot, Drive , and oh shoot AND drive is about all you get with rare fighting games, not a single vertical  / horizontal scroller
4	Went in midweek for lunch with a few guys from work. Place was quiet, easy to get seats. Staff were super friendly and efficient.  Some of the best wings I have ever had... Try the boneless wings, hot, and "Finished on the grill"... AWESOME!!! Also highly recommend the patty melt on marbled rye with sweet potato fries.
4	Fun neighborhood bar, with a new backroom filled with fun games such as skeeball!
3	Went here for dinner on a Saturday night.  Put our names in...and only had to wait about 30 min. Not too bad. The bar was a little too crowded to wait there, so we went a couple of doors down to pass our time. On to dinner...we had a great server.  He was super friendly, nice and was vocal with his opinions.  I would love to tell you that all of his reccs were spot on...but they werent. We started with the pretzels and the cheese fondue. DELISH.  I went halfsies with my friend and we shared the prime rib sammie and the shrimp caesar salad.  The prime rib sammie was mediocre.  The beef wasnt flavored at all, and when we got the fries, they were cold.  Hot plate, cold food..not a good sign. We did get fresh fries, I didnt finish my half, and moved on to the salad.  The salad was good, but not great. All in all, I would go for a drink and some apps, but wouldnt really want to eat dinner here again.  I may have just ordered wrong...but two meh things do it for me.
4	You know how you poke fun at people who go to a steakhouse and they order something like chicken or seafood? Im one of those people, but this time I teamed my seafood with STEAK! They had a prix fixe menu that carried over from their New Years Eve dinner, but I skipped over that... I have to say, I loved my sirloin and 5 pieces of shrimp. Shrimp was done correctly - not rubbery or charred and *gasp* it was actually de-veined. I cant tell you how Ive gone to nicer restaurants and their shrimp wasnt de-veined. So that alone got a little happy dance from me. Food was a bit on the salty side, but it didnt make me have a massive thirst craving when we left the restaurant. Server was friendly and knowledgeable, which was great! Hubby ordered his prime rib, but they didnt have it blue which was the way he wanted it. Its all good, they still brought him out some of the rarest prime rib Ive seen in a long time... For an appetizer we ordered bacon wrapped scallops. I am a firm believer of bacon makes everything good! and it did. The sauce that came with the dish was delicate and flavorful. The fresh rolls that came minutes before the entree was served were my favorite kind - light and fluffy on the inside while the outer layer had enough crunch that satisfied me, yet didnt make me feel like I was about to chip any teeth. ;) I cant wait to go back and try some of their other dishes!
5	Let me tell you about my first crush in Phoenix. It happened to me when I least expected. I was sitting at my small cubicle during my first job. Birthday cake graced the break room practically everyday but today was different. When I walked inside to sing an out of key version of the birthday song to my coworker, I noticed a masterpiece in front of my eyes. A white cake topped with the freshest of fruit and the creamiest of white chocolate morphed into a piece of artwork. One bite into the white cake filled with fresh strawberries and I was in lust. It later turned into love and Ive been happy every since.  I silently thank the coworker who introduced me to Honey Moon Sweets because I cant imagine life without knowing about this sweet Phoenix treat. Over the years, Honey Moon Sweets has been my go-to bakery for a special occasion. Ive purchased the "basic" cake for birthday parties. Let me just note here that a basic cake from Honey Moon Sweets is practically a masterpiece in any other bakerys mind. When planning my sisters baby shower, I knew exactly where to go. I wanted the perfect cake and a work of art to grace the baby shower table. And behold the Honey Moon Sweets baby cake. It was three tiers, blue with rattles, pacifier, building blocks, a crib, a teddy bear...you name it filling the top. Some of the pieces were frosting creations and some were real toys. It was almost too gorgeous to eat, but we couldnt resist it so enjoyed every bite. It was just as good as it looked if not better. Honey Moon Sweets does a fabulous job of using the freshest of ingredients and you can tell upon the first bite. The scariest part of this cake adventure was the travel time from the bakery to the Biltmore for the baby shower. One wrong move and the cake would have been toast so be prepared to move lightly with this cake in hand. As you can imagine, cakes from Honey Moon Sweets are not budget-friendly, but for what you get from the cake, its reasonably priced. Just save your coins for a special occasion because its worth it. I promise.
1	This wendys is terrible. I grew up going to Wendys but recently the whole chain has become disgusting. This one is just a slow, disgusting chain. Blah, rather eat pretty much any where else.
1	PIECE OF **** manager wouldnt put air conditioning on yesterday. It was 90. They just lost alot of business.
5	what can I say - were CF regulars...just love the place. I guess we are lucky because we have never had to wait more than 15-20 minutes for 3 of us.  We eat here at least twice a month and we always start with the avocado egg rolls - they are to die for and the dipping sauce is yummy!  I usually get a Glam burger - the only time I eat red meat -  and so far have not had one I did not like. I  often take 1/2 home so I can save room for some cheesecake, an absolute must when at CF. We have never had a bad cheesecake and try a different one each time. This is the only hamburger that I have liked the next day - usually hamburger is the one food that is not a good take home food as it just does not taste good as a left over - but I have actually eaten it cold because I took a bite before heating it and just kept going...yes, weird I know. If nothing else, go there for some avocado egg rolls and then treat yourself to a cheesecake....Im totally addicted! Absolute divine decadence! ;D
2	I have been twice, both at lunchtime. Cute (trendy) place, sushi rolls are decent, not spectacular. Loved sitting out on the patio; however, there was a distinct smell of sewage wafting by every once in a while. Not sure where that was coming from.  The hostesses were unfriendly. Waitresses were nice enough, but wow, S L O W service.  I mean, my God. I had nearly polished of a bottle of sake by the time the food got there (which may account for my belief that the sushi was good, lol!). Same embarrassingly slow service in getting our check to leave. Overpriced for a lunch menu, I thought, and the calamari appetizer was a huge disappointment. It was like ... TGI Fridays or something. Just very ... sportsbar-esque. Huge, rectangular chunks of calamari, heavily battered and deep fried. What happened to light tempura and calamari rings? Isnt this a Japanese restaurant? All in all, it was okay. I was in good company both times, and had plenty of time to spend, so the slow service was not an issue, but it could be a problem if you have other plans. I will likely go back until I am able to find a comparable or better sushi place - Im new to Arizona.
2	The fry bread in itself was great, it is just what goes inside it is not that great. I have been wanting to come here for a long time since I have heard so much about it. I got a bean and cheese fry bread and the beans came half smashed with whole pinto beans in it, which I cant stand. The beans are not very flavorful when they are whole. The cheese was a thick shred which didnt melt and it was altogether disappointing.  My partner got the fry bread with ground beef which he said was not flavorful at all. It was like they just cooked the beef with no flavoring at all. Maybe they were having a really off night? Yelp, why have you been betraying me lately? I keep going to these great reviewed places and they suck.
5	So going on vacation in a week and wanted to get a brazilian for the first time.  I gotta say the technician, Christine, was great!  She tells you what to expect and tosses in a little humor to keep you comfortable.  It was very clean, the wax isnt to hot, and the technician never double dipped.  I found the place very clean and comfortable.  Pricing is just right too.  I like that there are options to buy it for a year and go anywhere they have a shop. I did get told about product as others reviewed.  However, I didnt feel pushed because Christine explained how it can be used and why.  In addition, she told me of other uses for the product.   It was an all around good experience that I would recommend to any friend wanting to get waxed.
1	Still a place that is unacceptable in my book--especially when a server there goes out of their way to message me privately on Yelp to complain about my punctuation, and signing off--every so "sincerely" i might add, with: " love the B*tchy waitress from AZ88. Way to keep it classy over there.....
1	IF YOU HAVE KIDS YOU MUST READ!!! My husband and I have never been more insulted at a restaurant than tonight at the Hillstone Restaurant (Biltmore). This is the same restaurant group that includes Bandera and Houstons.  We deliberately went out early-- at 5pm -- with another couple and our son. He started to fuss on and off during dinner. Mind you the restaurant was already noisy when the GM Miranda Geranios instructed us to leave; other patrons were complaining. That was news to us- and weve seen far worse outbursts in the past from children. Ironically, our son at that moment was playing happily with the other couple when she rudely asserted herself.  We were in the middle of dinner and to add insult to injury, she didnt even offer to compensate us for a future visit without our little guy. Just go home without dinner and pay the bill. Of course, she herself has no children.  To ask a repeat customer to leave is absolutely disgusting. We will never visit any of their establishments again and wanted to share our unfortunate experience with our friends who also know the challenges of having a family.
5	I cant really say enough about Liberty Market. The place is beautiful, comfortable, friendly and the service is awesome. I havent had anything that I didnt like. From the wood fired pizza to the delectable salads, everything on the menu is worth every penny. For me though, its all about the Cortadito (espresso drink) and the pastries. These are completely off the chart awesome! You simply MUST try them! Another great plus to this place is that on just about any given day, you can visit and see Joe (the owner), hanging out, chatting with customers and all around having a great time. Joe is truly one of the nicest and most sincere people I have ever met. Makes Liberty Market all the more worth visiting. Oh! As weird as it sounds, you have to check out the bathrooms, they are the best I have ever seen. (seriously)
5	I love this place! This was the 4th and final stop on our search for a great dive bar in Old Town. Coach House was just was the doctor ordered, that is if the doctor had ordered you to find a great dive bar. Im still trying to find a doctor who will do that. Anyway, from the minute we walked up to the guy checking IDs it was a great experience. Everyone was friendly and chill. People actually talked to you and were having a good time. It was a great mix of people. We played pinball with some guy we met who I renamed the Pinball Wizard. I also found out that I am not as good at pinball after I have been drinking. Apparently if affects your hand eye coordination or something like that. Who knew? ;)  We also had fun hanging out with some other dudes we met there, and my drinks were $4.25. What more could I ask for? Great bar, great night!
4	Food and atmosphere, its excellent for me. We ordered the chicken satay with peanut sauce, my husband is generally picky and only praises the American comfort foods but this time , he liked it a lot. We ordered red chicken curry and two thumbs up! I cant wait to dine in at that place again. Winner!
4	Our visit to Scottsdale brought us into Fountain Hills to look for a home. While we were there we decided to look at the beautiful fountain we heard so much about. Thats when we happened upon this place. The pizza was fantastic!!! It made us want to move here even more. Delicious!
4	Happened upon Four Peaks when we drove up to the restaurant we wanted to go to and there wasnt a car in the parking lot! My hubs and I thought it was just the temps in Scottsdale, and everyone headed out of town for the weekend. However, when we walked into Four Peaks, it blew our assumption out of the water. The place was packed and the only seat left was in the bar, which was OK since we were only there for appetizers and beer.  We ended up ordering 1 entree as an appetizer, the fish and chips. The were quite good! Nicely cooked, not overly greasy and very crunchy.  Hubs got a dark and I got a light. We were very pleased with the beer and will be looking for a 6-pack in the stores. Im looking forward to heading back to Scottsdale to hang out here a bit longer and try some of their great looking menu!
3	Came here the other night in a party of 17.  Overall the experience was satisfying.  The waitresses were nice (yes, some had serious cleavage) and they were mostly on top of things - ordering the kids plates first, getting drinks/orders put in. The drinks were huge - I had a margarita which was served in a wine carafe.  Unfortunately there was hardly any alcohol in it so I supplemented with a shot of silver tequila.  Probably could have used a couple more shots! I had the baby back ribs.  The order was huge and I did my best.  The meat was tender and the sauce spicy.  Overall it exceeded my expectations (which werent too high given what Ive read here).  The plus was the entertainment value with people trying to ride the mechanical bull.  Only one person from our group did it - after 4 shots of Jack Daniels! Overall a great place to go to if youre looking for a casual place with some eye candy, decent food, and side entertainment.
5	This is my favorite place to go for Greek food. The owners are from Greece and frequently several family members are present. The food is delicious, large portions, friendly service. I wish they were located in Surprise, but they are worth the drive.
3	I thought the place had a lot to offer with the atmosphere and the ingredients used in the all of the dishes.  I only thought that the menu spoke louder than the dish.
5	This place is very good.  I have dined here for breakfast, lunch and dinner, but Sunday brunch takes the cake.  Food is all extremely fresh, and tasty.  The best time to go is when this place gets cranking, the style is smaller portions of the food, that have to be replaced very often when busy allowing for extremely fresh food.  Asian food is always good, and the gentlemen behind the line can do custom stir fry for you.  Italian station has fresh pizzas, that once again are made fresh for you, or order a custom calzone like I do.  Mexican station always has the staples, but recently had crab stuffed poblano rellenos!!!!  .  Bertos gelato with like 16 flavors is a great way to end your meal.  If you like buffets, do yourself a favor and make this your number 1!!!
5	Came for the beer, stayed for the scenery.
3	The features in the room seem outdated.  The room was a sauna when I got in and could not fix the problem because the thermostat was hard to figure out.  I woke up in the middle of the night because it was unbearable and a staff person did come by and was able to make the room a little cooler. I like the check-in and check-out kiosks so I dont have to wait on a line for a live person who seemed to be just chatting away with someone.
5	The best Asaian store around. Love the selection. Awesome smoked herring for cheap. Everything is so much cheaper and better than any other Asian store Ive been.
5	Great gluten free Italian place! Tell all you gluten free friends, they will love you for it!
4	So Ive been at Solo Cafe for about 2 and a half hours now writing a paper and so far so good!  When I first arrived here I was greeted by a very friendly barista who was happy to discuss the drink options with a first-timer. I settled on a mocha and it was delicious! I like that it wasnt scorching hot - so I could enjoy it right away instead of having to sit and stare at it for 5 minutes.  Also I really like the atmosphere here. The place is pretty small (I like this in a coffee shop - at least until I get here and theres no where to sit). Its also pretty quiet, which makes it a good place to sit and study. My favorite part is that I have been here for a while now and dont feel obligated to leave like some places.  The -1 star is because the chair Im sitting isnt very comfortable (hahah) but they do have couches, which is probably a better alternative. Also, they dont have a very wide selection of pastries/food. This is always a bummer when I go to a place to study. Im generally pretty lazy, so I dont like having to stop working to go somewhere else to get food. Despite this I will definitely be returning soon! (Anyway, my Yelp break is over... back to the paper) :(
4	The vibe exuding from this place is pure awesomeness. Reminiscent of a trendy hipster coffee joint, this is actually a casual vegan restaurant.  I am a pescatarian and unless I am eating seafood, I steer clear of meat, even the mock kind usually however once in a while its delicious... so why try it here at Green I thought. The menus style is comfort food, which as we all know traditionally is heavy on the meat, sauces, and fat content... so at least if youre going to be bad, you can do it with organic and pure ingredients. So as I wanted to sample as much of the menu as possible, my lovely friend, her fiance, and I shared a few items: *Artichoke Gratine: The corn chips were amazing, lightly salted and crisp. The dip was a bit too garlicky and runny for my liking. Ate a few bites of this but could not see myself eating the entire thing solo. *Spicy Buffalo "Wings": first things first... do not let looks dismay you... true it looks gross but they taste legit! The flavor of the buffalo sauce was perfect, although could have been spicier. And the cucumber ranch dipping sauce was perfectly creamy and lightly flavored as to not overpower the "wings". This dish is a must try!! *Vegan Chili Fries: the fries are thin cut and tasty. The chili sauce was good, at first, but I quickly got sick of the flavor. This could be because I was never a huge chili fan even back when I ate meat. Hmm, I think you are better off ordering the thyme fries. *Crab Puffs: Perfectly crisp with a delicious creamy filling. Another must try! Lastly my friends fiance ordered that days special which was a green chili burrito... delicious and huge. A bit too much rice but besides that a great option. It came with a side, which he ordered the curry pasta salad, mmm. Green serves bowls, sandwiches, pizzas, salads... next time I am back in the area I will be checking out more of the menu when craving "meat" and not my usual tofu, seafood, veggie diet.   Might I add the service is friendly. Perfect place for a casual friend date.
5	Great flavors even though there arent many to choose from! Fresh fruit is such an awesome feature as most places are def not and limited to the healthy choices of topping! I visit as often as I can!!
5	Everything here is awesome! I love the Kung Pao shrimp and the Hong Kong soup which has wontons and and egg noodles they make in house. The soup they bring out before your meal is delicious as well. Everything tastes made to order, always fresh never greasy, and is presented beautifully. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Definitely try this place! Its a regular lunch spot for my office. They also have great lunch specials. :)
5	One of my favorite places to go with the kids for lunch.  Bring a small amount of $ - grab yourself a table under the trees and enjoy the afternoon away while your kids play within eyesight.  The entire "patio" is really a large, fenced grassy, tree filled area with 2 volleyball courts, multiple gathering areas, ping pong, horse shoes, jumbo checkers and even another fenced in area full of sand and toys for the kids.
3	Okay, so Kevin and I initially wanted to go to Samauri Sams next door, but they closed at 5 (seriously??), so we checked out Yelp reviews for this place and decided to give it a go. The atmosphere was... interesting. Very loud mural on the wall of a cartoon pig cooking meat, with innuendos littered all over the place (see photos other reviewers have left). It is a very clean establishment, and the staff was super welcoming and friendly. I am not a huge fan of barbecue, but my pulled pork sandwich was amazing, as well as the warm cornbread I got on the side. Kevin got something similar with some spicy sausage or something. I didnt care for his, mostly because I dont like spicy things, but he enjoyed it. I think the food and the staff is worth between 4 and 5 stars, but OMG the music. Nothing but really lame jazz and 90s soul music. Each song was progressively worse than the last, and I kid you not - Brian McKnight came on and I just about lost it. The music did not match the atmosphere and killed the vibe for us, although we had a few giggles and fully enjoyed being there anyway. Would I go again? Yes. Would I most likely strangle the person in charge of music next time? You can count on it.
4	I almost dont even want to write a review for this place. Its so near and dear to my heart and I basically live here that I just dont know how to NOT write a novel of a review for this place. So Ill attempt to bullet point my feelings on the joint: A. Friday Happy Hour - need I say more? Pretty sure all the homies would agree that weve spent thousands of dollars here over the years. Youre welcome Lodge.  B. Cheese Curds - FRIED cheese balls and ranch. nuff said.  C. Best server ever, my homeboy Michael (you guys need to give him a raise. I havent seen him around much lately and Im pretty sure thats why Ive been at Kellys more recently) D. Black-outs D+. I have a scar on my left knee where I ate shit playing cornhole. How do you eat shit playing cornhole? No clue. Probably because of the above point listed above.  E. Lodge stimulus package - $6 for a can of PBR, a shot of nasty ass whisky, and a cigarette. BEST DEAL IN TOWN. Pretty sure the ex got nice and hammered a few times off this lil package - great deal ladies. Get your man sloshed and then take advantage of him. Always a good idea.  The only reason why theres not 5 stars is sometimes when you sit on the patio, it takes about a year for a server to come around. Best bet it to hunt one of them down and start a tab that way.  Oh The Lodge. Such great memories here...and most of them are just hazy bits and pieces.
2	Meh. My standards for quality froyo are high since I frequent Yogurtology (Shea and Scottsdale), Yogurtland (Im the Duke in Scottsdale), and sometimes I go to Mojo in Tempe.  This place has "ok" flavors. I had the original tart, that was quite a bit tart. The toppings are ok. My friend really liked the fact that they have banana chips, but thats because we usually eat our froyo at home and we were far away from home, and she didnt have to use her personal stash.  Since it made her happy, I gave this place an extra star. Im cool like that. Hmm...lets see. They have a snow machine. Not really sure what this is for. It seems out of place.  Its far from my house, and not really worth my drive. I guess if it was by my house, and I had no other options, Id frequent this business.  This is the one time, and one time only that I will say this.....Thank God, I live in Old Town Scottsdale.
5	I have been coming to this place for atleast 5 years. This is a favorite of my friends whole family.  This place is so very consistent. They always have the same good things. If youre looking for buffet variety this is not the place.  Everyone is so very nice. This place has been open for 30 years for good reason. I have never ordered from their menu because their buffet is so good.  Go and try not to get hooked.  Enjoy!
3	The property is beautiful and clean.  Restaurants were great.  The problem is the front desk snobs.  No personality.  They messed up my reservations, made me and my family find our own hotel for the night that they messed up?  They didnt even try to get us another room, despite me paying any price.  After a long day of travel with an infant, toddler and wife, the last thing I want to do is look for another hotel at 11 PM, only to come back the next day. The attitude of the front desk is sad and horrible.
4	This is a little hockey dive-bar located in the Arcadia area.  TV screens hang above the bar & as you look behind the bar you can see the hockey rink and players.  Enternaining as the other review said.  I had Dunkel Hefeweisen and my girlfriend had a Corona.  Good times as a group of kids played Rock Band and sang off-key Nirvana covers.  I like this little hidden place.  Just be prepared - its your average little bar for the average Joe guy.
5	This is a brand new delicatessen whos grand opening was September 24th 2008.  Since I dont have a kitchen in my place, this re-heat one-stop shop near my neighborhood will be a place I plan to frequent via walking.   They have a cute cook book lounge and the deli layout is fun to just paroose.  Their chocolate chip cookies taste home made.  So nice to still feel like you have some input in the cooking preparation process when you live with just a microwave.
4	I went there on a Mon around 9:30 am. It was a ghost town and we got seated very quick. I have to say they have the most comfortable seats!  I didnt sit in the chair but a like bench couch thing? Super soft. The whole decor and music vibe was really cool, I really dugg it. My girlfriend got  french toast (because she is a bitch and has to be super toned and fit with out working out or eating good) which came with chicken apple sausage. Ok, heres the thing about that, I hate sausage(insert lesbian joke here) but it didnt have the typical sausagy flavors. It was really  really good. It was tangy salty and sweet.  The french toast was extremely good. I think it may have been dipped in blueberry before cooked? The waitress was super accomodating, and nice.  Oh and they do have french press coffee which I was disappointed by , but after I had it.. holly crap best coffee ever!!!! it was smooth had good flavors, no bitterness at all.  The only use butter and vegetable oil which is soo nice to see they dont load you up with horrible for you margerine.  My only complaint is, I ordered a sandwich and got a totally different one. When I told them she went to the cooks and found out they didnt have that bread and randomly added egg?  She took it back and it was no big deal but she informed me it was only a month old and were still learning the menu.  Kinda weird but nothing big, my new favorite breakfast place.
3	Food is ok. Pad Thai is sub-par. The happy hour is very cool baby suburban around this joint.  Its attached to Chandler Fashion Center, so its busy pretty much all of the time. happy hour specials are just ok, specialty drinks are pretty expensive with little taste and even less alcohol. plus, i loathe happy hours that you can only enjoy in the "bar" area. the patio is the spot for HH, and its LOUD. not just with vapid chatter, but with the constant scraping of meatl chairs on the concrete. it sounds like im being picky, but its one of those sounds that makes your skin crawl and just kills your mood instantly - over and over and over. anyway, if youre a big time up-and-comer and want everyone to know, this is the place for you.
5	Its just a terrific steakhouse.  One of the most upscale, all around dining experiences in Phoenix.  Its expensive.  Very expensive.  But probably worth it.  Figure $150-200 for a couple. I had the double filet medallion with blue cheese melted and a wine demiglaze.  Absolutely outstanding, amazingly tasty meats.  Equal or better than Mortons or Ruths Chris or Capitol Grill (thats on the menu for tomorrow night).  Smashed potatoes were very good but nothing to write home about.  Veggies were pretty good. Started with the ceasar salary, with a big pile of anchovies.  Perhaps the best Caesar Ive ever had. Desert was the mouse cake.  Good, but not to die for. Their happy hour is also an excellent value.  Come before six and drinks are half off, and they serve little mini steak sandwhiches, which are very good. Hint:  If you have kids, go to happy hour and have a drink or two.  Cocktails are in the $7 range happy hour price.  Cucumber cooler was quite nice for a cocktail.  Let the kids eat the sandwiches, and then head to the dining room for a couple of filets.  The kids are pretty full, you are nicely primed for a great steak, and the complete lack of a kids menu doesnt matter.   Honestly, otherwise, there really arent any good kids options.  I know, its not a great place for kids, even well behaved, but sometimes you want to celebrate a special occasion with family.   It would be nice if they offered a mini-filet for 12 and under for like $15, or a burger and fries for $10 for the kids.  Just a thought. Anyway, great experience, great food.  A really upscale, while linen, old style steakhouse kind of place to have prime beef.
3	For mall food this place is great. Love the pitas, rice, and yummy potatoes.
4	First time here--glad we came!  Free chips and salsa (always a great start to a Mexican meal!).  Hubby and I split the chicken fajitas, which were very tasty!  Good-sized portion with lots of red bell peppers, which we like. Served with side of rice and beans, guac, sour cream, and pico de gallo.  We each ate our fill and still had enough for a take-home fajita burrito :D
4	NEEDS A CUSTOMER FACING DISPLAY FOR THEIR POINT OF SALE SYSTEM. The staff here is WONDERFUL, and the OWNER IS ALWAYS HERE, yes thats right, if you come here often, you have the pleasure of meeting Lenny himself. But one major flaw is that they need a display on their point of sale system showing you what you have ordered before you pay (just like their Glendale location), because I have had my order messed up more than quite a few times here, usually they forget my extra french fries, or place everything in the world on my cheese burger, when I only wanted the cheese, meat, and bun. Other than that, I dont really have anything negative to say about this place. I love the staff, and if the right person is at the register, they remember my order and the negative points I have made above is negated.
2	Burger was great, but the service wasnt so great. When thumbing through my wallet for cash, the owner rudely interrupted me and told me they dont accept cards, only cash payment.  When my friend asked what he would recommend, he shoved a menu in his face and said "Id recommend looking at a menu".  I fought back the urge to just leave and go somewhere else and ordered  the Good Ass burger, which was avocado and bacon, so you cant really go wrong with that. The fries were good and the burger was pretty good.  Service: 1 star Food: 4 stars Average: 2 stars http://dietstartstomorrow.com/post/2983024079/two-hippies-magic-mushroom-burgers-phoenix
5	Im usually not a big buffet fan, but this place changed my mind!  Its very clean, good service, lots and lots of amazing dishes, AND really good sushi!  Weekend lunch was $14.99, but during the week its $11.99. Well worth every penny. One more comment, this isnt the kind of buffet where "shifty people" go. The kind where you need to Purell your hands and arms when you get back to the table : )
5	Very yummy, my favorite roll is the Las vegas, and here they make a good one and its 1/2 off during happy hour. I keep meaning to come for the all you can eat sushi! Try the Ice Cream sushi roll, this is one of the only places I know that does it and it is delicious!
2	The service was slow, the server knew nothing of the wines on the menu and knew nothing of proper wine service.  Boo.
5	Durants ROCKS. I love the red velvet walls. I love walking through the kitchen to get to the restaurant. I love the garlicky cheesy bread that probably has a million calories in it. I love the steaks. I love the decor. I love the bar. We all ordered different items when we went here for dinner one night, and all raved about what we had.  I dont think you can go wrong, no matter what you order.  Its amazing, delicious, and very very unique.
2	Eh... the food was good but not something Id crave?  I had a chicken/swiss panini that evidently came with corn on it? EDIT: (actually it was the Adobe Panini: "Mesquite turkey, fresh mozzarella, green peppers, corn relish and chipotle mayo".  I got called out that there wasnt anything on the menu I said I ate, got it a little wrong but the review remains the same regardless. Here you go Bob M.) Slightly surprised on it but, cant complain... it was good but nothing great. They have subs and soups too - Id go there again if friends were already going but def not somewhere Id really mention when trying to think of somewhere to eat.
5	Wow! I was in town on a week long business trip and the one thing I look forward to most when I travel are the meals. Cafe Monarch was a highlight of my trip. As soon as I walked through the door I felt cozy and right at home. Chef Chris asked me what I preferred out of a few selections and I went with the lamb chops and spinach.  Usually Im pretty picky about lamb and always inquire about prep but I left myself in his hands.  Chef Chris served me a perfectly cooked thyme rubbed lamb with a wonderful citrus sauce.  Spinach was prepared with garlic and a hint of mint which complemented the lamb perfectly.  Simple, fresh, delicious... Just remember to bring cash
4	Weve eaten here a number of times and have always had the best service and great food.  All of the servers weve had were excellent and the manager always makes it a point to check on us and see if we need anything.  No complaints and well definitely be eating there again.
5	Love this lake. Went paddle boarding a few weeks back here and had the best time. Lake water is so clean you can almost see the bottom. Highly recommend this lake if you love water sports and fishing :)
5	Ok, these guys get five stars from me for many reasons.  Before my visit today my other experience with them was for my wedding cake.  They were very courteous and helpful, although I ended up going with a cheaper option.  Today, however, they definitely earned five stars. I was there for a meetup event.  We got a tour of their facilities.  The owner personally did the tour, and did a great job considering I brought my toddler, who screamed through about 75% of the tour.  At the end, he gave us a cookie and thanked us for coming.   I know that some people think toddlers should be locked away so as not to annoy the general populous, but its nice to know not everyone feels that way :)
5	This is my neighborhood Chinese Restaurant and a family staple.  I personaly like the roasted / peking duck.  The Shrimp Lo-Mein is good, Fast, Friendly Service, No MSG. Lunch Specials  during the week are awesome too.
5	Oh my goodness, Hank is awesome! Weve had nothing but problems with landscapers and we finally found someone well be sticking with. Hank is very professional, knowledgeable, responsive, prompt, communicates thoroughly and is very reasonable.  And by the way...hes actually there doing the work! Trust me, weve gone through them all and I had almost given up hope.  Hank has been better than expected - we almost dont want to tell anyone so he doesnt get too busy for us!  :)
4	HUGE fan! Love Poncho, the birthday strobe lights, the food and the service.  This is a go-to for my boyfriend and I when were looking for sushi. More likely than not, well opt for the all you can eat option for $20/ person.  With that comes with miso soup, salad, sashimi, your AYCE picks, ice cream and with a special frequent customer request, this awesome pan seared, naturally fatty sea bass belly and salmon cheeks, which are AMAZING. Not a taste for everyone, kinda bizarre for most. But this will be well appreciated by traditional Asian taste and PERFECT for me. Loyalist here.
4	AZ 88 was a great experience all around. Its a fun, hip and hopping place. They have an excellent bar selection, and although all I can only personally speak for is the to-die-for burgundy burger, there were four us and everyone was raving about their meals.
5	AMC Esplanade is by far the most successful navigator of the new "Dinner and a Movie" blue ocean the theater industry is starting to penetrate (thats right, I just referenced Blue Ocean Strategy, get over it).  No, its not an extremely enlightened idea. Ive been sneaking Bacardi into theaters since 2003 so its about time theaters realize they should probably attempt to turn a profit off of it, but AMC really upped the game by not only providing me the option of purchasing alcoholic beverages from THEM, but also upgraded chairs, and a ton of delicious food (Including the obligatory $4 box of candy which is hilarious sitting next to a $9 burger. Like "Dont mind this $9 full meal over here, we still stand firm that Gummi Bears are worth their weight in gold.") Yes, its more expensive than a regular ticket. Almost double for the nice seats. But trust me, YOU WANT THOSE SEATS. You will regret not getting the $15 seats if you dont buy the $15 seats so just pony up the cash and delight in the fact that movie theaters are now almost as comfortable as watching a movie in your own home.  This theater is so nice it even makes bad movies tolerable. I saw The Master here and probably would have stabbed myself in the eye with my embezzled Bacardi flask if I didnt have a comfy recliner and three glasses of wine to get me through it. I seriously wont go to a movie anywhere else and I guarantee youll say the same once you go. FIVE STARS.
5	My husband and I enjoyed a "staycation" here for my birthday. We had an amazing time! We took advantage of the great happy hour specials at the poolside bar and at the Sangria bar. The Sangria bar had billiards and a card table. They also had a wonderful Happy Hour menu where everything is $5. Excellent hamburgers and margaritas. We enjoyed a beautiful  dinner at Palm Court and a breakfast buffet at Vista Verde. We took advantage of the free bike rentals and the exercise facility. The staff was amazing and very accommodating. They have definitely earned our business and will refer our friends.
4	I have heard about this place for couple years before I actually get to try it out. Their guacamole burger is my favorite, and the Peanut Butter Malt was just amazing!! First time I tried, I ended up getting another one to go. They also have corn beef sandwich on Thursday, which I havent get the chance to try yet. Only thing I dislike is that they close at 8 pm which is a bit too early for me.
3	clean store, good parking - decent prices too with the gas points savings is a nice bonus.
5	This place had me from the moment our waitress asked us if it was o.k. if our water was infused with the flavor of cucumber.  Heck yeah it was o.k. in fact I dont even want to order a drink, I just want the free cucumber water!  My buddy and I decided to start with an app. order of sweet potato waffle fries with dipping sauce.  Delightful!  I ordered the sweet potato and garbonzo burger and the sweet potato and avocado salad side dish.  Notice the sweet potato theme??  I love those crazy orange taters!  The food was really tasty and quite flavorful.  The burger was a little different than I expected because it didnt come on a bun..but no biggie.  In typical girl fashion, my buddy and I split a cupcake...finger lickin good!  I am picky-picky but this place won me over big time!  Also, I felt that, for the location, their prices were very reasonable.  The prices for those condos located upstairs..well thats gotta be a different story!
3	Nothing special about this place.  Clean and the food is okay. I go because my one son loves it.  Have to keep the kids happy.  Never had a bad experience but never had anything stand out either.  My fav dish is the Spinach artichoke dip.
4	the rustica looks like a penis. thankfully, it tastes like pizza. super thin, crunchy crust pizza.  the husband and i went for lunch to the one in scottsdale, the other day. we shared a spinach salad and each had some pizza. the salad was very good and plenty for two people to share.  i had the appropriately called "meat" rustica and it was really good. this is the only the second place in phx ive had pizza that doesnt make me feel like i splashed my face in grease after. (grazi is the other).  the husband had two slices, which were more than plenty for a meal. they were completely different styles of pie and both were great.  well definitely hit this one again.
3	The place was pretty empty - even for an off night. The service was pretty decent, but like I said - it was empty.  Ive been in here a few times, but never when its busy. The prices dont impress me, but Id say you get a pretty decent pour for the money.  One thing Id like to point out - a 1.5L bottle of Dom is less than 1000 bucks, but a 3.0L bottle of Dom is 3500. If youre a fucking idiot, get the 3L. If youre a smart shopper, youll get two 1.5L bottles or else just by the glass - which works out even cheaper. Just so you know, it works the opposite way Costco does. If youre getting a big ass bottle of Dom anyway, you probably dont care. The decor is red. Its very dark in here at night... dark and loungy rather than clubby. Similar to Merc Bar, but not as hip or hidden... even though they try to hide it with curtains. Its also pleasantly quiet in here... easy to have conversations.  With the patio door open, youre going to smell cigarettes people are smoking outside if youre sitting at the bar or on the couch adjacent to there.  Its a nice bar, but I dont know that Id single it out as a "place to be." I actually think the Mondrian is pretty nice - but thats based entirely on good memories that are completely unrelated to the place and have more to do with the people I was with at the time. If someone wealthy and hip was here from out of town looking to party, the Mondrian is one of a handful of hotels Id suggest. Not so much because of Red Bar, but more because its conveniently located within stumbling home distance to so many other better bars in Downtown.
5	I cant describe to you how amazing these gourmet adult hot pockets taste! They literally MELT in your mouth- a few of my favorites are the Cajun Chicken, Dill Salmon, and the Stilton & Steak---Bon Appetit everyone! And dont forget about the all day everyday-$3 car bombs(you cant beat that price) their happy hour is amazing, too!
4	Went to this location last week - was nervous to go because although I love waffles, and fried chicken, the idea of eating them together freaked me out.  But my husband is a huge fan, so I decided to suck it up.  Im glad I did... Although I typically prefer my waffles a little crispier than LoLos makes them, the flavor was to die for!!!  And who doesnt love some delicious fried chicken!  I know I do.... Try it!  Youll love it!
3	Jason B. and I decided to try this place on Saturday night. I looked at the menu online and though the food sounded really interesting. We started with the Artichoke Croquettes, and the Calamari as well. We were disappointed in the Artichoke Croquettes, you get 4 half Artichokes fried with alternating Marinara and this white sauce. The only thing that was good about this dish was the white sauce, which we used to dip the Calamari in. The Calamari was your average calamari, nothing special!  I ordered a the 19th Street Burger, which was cooked perfectly and came with a spicy sauce, not sure if the sauce was for the Onion Rings, but it was great of the Burger. Not sure I will be rushing back to the Armadillo Grill, but I wouldnt say no to going back again!
4	We stumbled upon this little place in a worn strip mall by accident, but it ended up being a very happy accident.  Yes, it is true that the decor will not be gracing the pages of fashion magazines anytime soon, but this is a clean, no-frills kind of place. There is also no point in coming here if you are pressed for time, because it is not fast food by any stretch of the imagination. Most importantly, the food is good. Really good.  The menus must have changed since other reviewers visited, because there was no Arabic on the menu. Everything is in English. I had the falafel plate and my companion had the lamb shank and rice. Both meals came with a wonderful lentil soup that I have had at Fattoush many times- but this one was so much better. The falafel plate came with falafel of course, a questionable salad, pita that looked homemade, and some of the tastiest hummus ive ever had. It was a huge amount of food, but it was so good that I was compelled to order an extra side of hummus to go with the leftovers. The lamb was apparently very tasty also- im not much of a lamb fan, so I didnt try it. The accompanying rice was very tasty though- very complex with many different flavors, but none of them were overwhelming.  At 7.99 for the falafel and 9.99 for the lamb plate, the prices are more than reasonable, especially when you consider that each entree can easily end up being two meals.  I admit that I am partial to Middle-Eastern food and rarely meet a falafel that I dislike, but this was definitely one of the better examples of the cuisine in the metro Phoenix area. I will definitely be back, and maybe next time ill try the chicken.
4	Great service, and great food.  Passed snacks included an artichoke cake served cold with an olive tapenade.  My favorite was a shaved beef with mascapone dressed in truffle oil.  The main courses included a cesar salad served in individual cups.  Sliders were delicious with my favorite being chicken with roasted pineapple.  They had a wonderful shrimp pasta dish that was gobbled up by people.  Desserts were cupcakes in four different flavors, red velvet with real cream cheese frosting, a chocolate decadent cupcake, luscious lemon and finally a vanilla buttercream.  I will definately recommend them for our next catering event in house.
4	Tonight was great. I had a calzone, pepperoni and olive,  Coppola Zinfandel, the wife had a pizza with nice and hot jalapenos. The staff was nice, so much that we made comments to each other about the quality.
4	Excellent food! I always get the 3tacos! Best bang for your buck!
4	Nice little find for casual sushi
4	My husband and I ventured up to BLT Steak at Camelback Inn on Friday evening to celebrate our third wedding anniversary, which was two days earlier. We sat inside and our corner table gave us a perfect view of Camelback Mountain at night.  Our waiter was super nice and did a great job of suggesting items and answering questions when we had them. There was a seperate server who kept our water glasses full all night - we couldnt take more than two sips without having them refilled it seemed like. My only negative about our waiter was that when it was time for a new glass of wine for me, he didnt check with me first to see if I wanted another glass of the same wine. I think we all know the common saying about assuming things... On to the food...heres what we sampled: Popovers - delicious. I was a bit skeptical about the butter and sea salt, especially since I dont like butter very much, but it was great!  Caesar salad - good size and it was one of the best caesar salads I have had in awhile.  Crabcake - my least favorite part of the meal. While it wasnt horrible, there was a bit too much celery for my taste and not enough crab meat. Cowboy Ribeye - since it was 22 oz, I graciously told my husband that I would have some of it so he could order it. Now those that know me know that I dont eat red meat because I dont like the taste. But I sucked it up and had some...holy crap, I had a few bites and said, "Wow, this is really good". So that should say something about how good it was. However, my husband did think the outside was a tad too well done, although the meat itself was cooked perfectly. While he liked the ribeye, he did think his steak at SW Steakhouse in Las Vegas was better. Mashed potatoes - is it possible to get divorced over mashed potatoes? I thought we were going to throw it down because one side of the potatoes was just not enough!! They were sooo creamy and delicious.  Chocolate peanut butter mousse - we got our dessert for free since when I made the reservation I indicated we were celebrating our anniversary. The dessert was a nice way to end the meal, although the chocolate on top was just a touch too rich for my taste. With tip, our bill came to $162 which we did not think was bad at all for as much as we ordered. Unfortunately we didnt get to sit on the patio or enjoy the view at sunset, but I guess that means well have to go back which isnt a bad thing at all!
4	Im a great believer and loyal customer of Carried Away. They do carry LV, although they fly off the shelves fast! Ive brought in 2 and both were gone by days end! If youd like to be put on a "call list" when they come in, theyll do that for you! Although there are several others that are on it too. Im going in today to drop off two more in fact! Happy holiday!
5	Habaneros is an awesome little gem stuck in the strip mall hell known as Scottsdale.  If you are one looking for an original meal at a decent price, try out Habaneros.   I am addicted to their chipotle sauce.  You can find it in almost every item there.  Try out the Shrimp or Fish tacos, they are delicious.  Sometimes the food takes a little while to cook (and there could be a line).  So be prepared if you are going there on your lunch break.  The salsa is not as spicy as I would like, but I am splitting hairs at this point. Go try Habaneros, you wont be disappointed.  Its a nice change from every unoriginal, corporate restaurant you find in Scottsdale.
3	Amanda B organized a UYE for Dim Sum here today.  They do Dim Sum from a menu instead of carts and it works really well.  They also have a picture menu to look at with many of the items on it so folks like me can have a better idea what to order just by picking the picture of stuff they liked on a prior trip.  We were pretty much the only folks there for quite a while and we had the full attention of the staff.  Not all of the staff is fluent in English but I can only recall that being a problem with the tea.  I liked my choices a bit better this time, experience helps, and Marian H was helping me with sauce pairings as there were several to choose from. I almost gave them a 4 but for the restroom.  The fixtures had a lot of corrosion around them and in general the restroom showed a lot of wear.  I flushed the urinal and was washing my hands and it seemed like the running water was very loud, I looked over at the urinal and the valve had stuck and the place was indeed flooded.  I beat on the valve with my fist until it rocked back but by that time the floor was quite deep in water.  I mentioned it to the hostess and they had someone in there with a mop quickly. I would definitely go back here again.
4	Theres not much more I can say about Rula that hasnt already been said. Except, I guess, I can tell you why I like this place. I like it for two glorious words: HAPPY + HOUR.  Yes, those two words matters so much to me. Rula offers 1/2 off all appetizers and discounts on pints. What could be better? I say try the brie, for it comes with an unbelievable apple chutney. If youre looking to split an entree with a friend, opt for the lamb stew - served with a side of soda bread. The stew is hearty and the serving is huge. Ive also had the shepherds pie, which was pretty tasty. Way too large for one person, though.  Also, I discovered that Rula can make ya a Raspberry or Chocolate Guinness. I dont know how either tastes, for I went with a plain (but satisfying) pint. I asked to sample the concoctions, but was told Rula doesnt let people sample liquors. Fair enough.  If I could change one thing about this place (ok, maybe more than one thing), Id have a larger beer selection - even sold by the bottle. Id also make it less noisy and crowded at night. If you dont get there early enough to stake your spot, youre likely to be standing the entire time. That doesnt make for a very comfortable experience. Word to wise: take advantage of Rulas casual atmosphere and leave your ridiculously high heels at home. Its great that Rula offers live music. I wish they offered more. Sure, the outside patio is great, but what if Im in the mood to play darts? I guess Ill have to go to another bar for that... and for the beer Im really craving. WORD TO NON-MEAT EATERS: Try their veggie burger thingy - with mushrooms, peppers and such all heaped between two soft and delicious pieces of bun. Yum. It comes served with fresh, crispy and DIVINE tator wedges. These aint your normal french fries, people. I STILL have cravings for them! Rula Bulas food deserves 5 stars!
5	Im completely impressed by The Mission and I cant wait to go back and try more of their amazing food.   My husband and I chose The Mission for our 8th Anniversary dinner and had a wonderful time - the staff is extraordinarily knowledgeable and very warm & welcoming.  Yelp steered us in the right direction as per usual, so we split the cheese plate with manchego to start, the pork shoulder tacos for dinner and split a pumpkin bread pudding for dessert.  Everything was expertly prepared and delicious.  The bread pudding was EASILY the best Ive ever had.  We usually dont order desserts and Im glad we did, because I cant stop thinking about how amazing this was.   My husband had an Avocado Margarita and an Estrella beer (Awesome that they have this available - and it was even served in an Estrella glass - impressive).  Since Im pregnant, I asked if the bartender could make me a virgin version of their "Sophia Loren" with fresh strawberries & mint - score!  It was delicious and Ill certainly be back to try it with the proper amount of booze :)    Lastly, how amazing is that Himalayan Salt Brick wall????  I NEED this in my house!
4	Went here for lunch a couple weeks back and told myself I would write a review...i completely forgot! :( But today I drove by it and it reminded me to write a review.  First thing is...Value.....You get a ton of food....for basically nothing....they have daily specials that are always good but their burritos that can stuff a horse are like 3$....Be warned however that they dont tell you this....so when you order a burrito and 3 tacos because you think it cant be much food due to the low price......youll know.  I got a burrito with pork and it was delicious...too many beans for me but thats easily correctable next time....by time I got half way...I knew there was no way I was getting to taste the "famous fish tacos" if I kept going. So I stopped with the burrito and moved on to the fish tacos....yum...they were very good....I still prefer the burritos..but as a lighter meal you can do the tacos and be very full and very happy. Again...beans were a bit much but Ill just ask for light beans next time.  They also make these flavored lemonade slushis there that are pretty tasty.  All in all a very friendly place with friendly owners who live up to the name of the place and they make great food for VERY affordable prices.  When I was there they were Cash Only...I dont know if that has changed...but bring cash just in case.
4	Wound up at Rock Bottom by chance had been wanting Carrabbas all day, due to being brain washed by commercials on TV so that when a friend said lets go out for dinner I was all gun ho to say Carrabbas, then he said Im in the mood for steak I tossed the pasta idea out the window and said Bring on the beef,  plus never been to Rock Bottom so I was thrilled at being able to try a new place! It was a Sunday night and the place was simi empty, which was nice. Service was fast and friendly and I liked the overall vibe of the place. I ordered the Texas Fire Steak which was top sirloin seasoned with crazy peper and smoking jalapeno butter, man it was delish!! Even the veggies were good!  Looking forward to another trip there to try out some more the menu!
5	Outstanding and fantastalistic comes to mind. Real good.
2	Stopped by one night late, only one guy working, probably the manager/owner based on him being on the phone and looking like he wanted to gtfo dodge attitude and not wearing anything quiznos related like most workers do...  Food... subpar... its a chain... its hard to fuck up... but he did. There was no care in the making of the sub... I pretty much watched him throw it together, run it through the toaster tossed some lettuce on and wrap it up... I had chips in my hand... wanted a meal... he didnt ask and just rang it up w/o the drink... I asked what size cup to grab and he said "oh you wanted a drink?"  Of course I wanted a fucking drink... I just stared at him like wtf man?  Told him to keep his drink cause hed have to re run my card...   srsly its a chain that gives you all the stuff and training to make a sandwich like the other 1000s of quiznos around the country... and you cant do it. If you hate customer service dont buy a franchise sandwich shop. Two stars... lucky it isnt one. Im out
4	I have stayed in this hotel a few times. I think overall its good. I am happy with the golf view. The restaurant is alright. Update 9/7/07 - I stayed over at this Hotel again....really great customer service!
5	Ive been coming here for several years.  Cant find my first review.  I guess it was too long ago.  So here comes another one. The woman who runs the place.  Ive forgotten her name.  She is one of the most gracious, friendly, and kind people you can ever hope to meet. When I go there, sometimes with and some times without my wife, I alway order the small sausage sandwich.  With ajvar and onion, this cant be beat no matter how you my search around.  The sausages, cevap, are delicious and whats unusual is that the bread is almost as good as the sausages.  Simply delicious from all points of view.  They make their own sausages and their own bread from scratch.  In fact they make everything from scratch right there in the restaurant.  Their soups are do die for. A very favorite of ours. I give this a 5 star because in the Bosnian/Jugoslavian cuisine catagory, this cant be beaten. One more thing worth mentioning:  her Baklava is top of the mark.  Its not as sweet as what you find in other restaurants.   Everything is simply top shelf.
4	I went to the one in Mesa on Baseline. I loved the vibe, service, and decor. They have witty jokes on the walls and the whole place makes you feel like you are at a party on the beach. We ordered the carne asada burrito and the mushroom burger and the sweet potato fries. We got the dessert pear and blackberry lemonades. You get 1 free refill so we tried the blood orange and the guava flavors after. Everything tasted great. I would def go back and get the mushroom burger. The prices are super cheap and the portions are huge.
4	Only went to the downstairs bar, but cannot wait to return!  Very cool with the rock and copper features and leather couches.  We sat at the bar and were served drinks that you pour yourself.  Is this a new trend?  He gave us little glass bottles of tonic and coke with little spoons to stir our drinks with.  Those little spoons were so cute I was almost tempted to put them in my purse.  If another couple hadnt been hogging the fireplace the whole time, we would have sat there.  Maybe next time.  Well try to food too.
3	A buddy of mine takes me to this place for dinner, usually, and once for breakfast. Its an interesting place. As others have noted, be prepared to wait a while for service and dont be afraid to go get your waiter if youre feeling abandoned. Also, there may be a wait for a table, and the environment is loud, so be prepared to shout a bit if its busy.  They have beer-tasting on certain nights. I did not partake, but my Dad (who was visiting AZ) did. The food varies in quality (or perhaps just varies in quality of recipe?). My Orange Table friend and I shared a special pork chop dish, and that was pretty blah. However, I highly recommend their grilled cheese sandwich on some sort of yummy bread (the lower end cheese sandwich ~ I have yet to try the fancy one).  As for breakfast, I dont recall it being particularly spectacular, but I think it was better than your average diner breakfast. I may have to go back to try again... The flavored iced coffee seems very evil and full of calories, but it is really quite good. That did stand out! Orange Table is recommended if you want a place to chill and chat with your friends. Just try to find out what others are eating so that you pick something good from the menu. : )
5	Its just like pizza bianco without the wait. This pizza is a 9.9999 and bianco is a 10. This place has a much larger menu and their deserts are to die for.  If bianco has more then a 30 min wait just drive and or walk here.
4	Trusted as a consistent Friday HH or evening meal/get together spot for a long time. We have been a slave to the Wingless Buffalo Dip the whole time. We have been fortune enough have a great server (Mallory) most of our visits as well. She has never steered us wrong in food choices. I have had the pizzas, the sandwiches and even some special entrees. It has all been good. The Reuben sandwich is a favorite and so is the Sonoran burger. The sweet potatoes fries are always really good side.  Now some friends have had some bad experiences with service. They have a hard time returning. It happens, esp. when it is first Friday or when the host staff is out of their minds, there is just an inconsistency there. But dont let that ruin the tone of the meal. Awesome Patio. Parking can be a pain, but sometimes you can park close around the corner. Great mix of people, so good people watching too. Seating is tight at times, because sometimes you are seated right next to another table where you can here each others convos. Can be fun at times. Def. take all of our out of town guests here. Great HH spot.
4	I have visited Windsor twice now and I would describe it as fun, trendy, and a little hipster. The drinks are great, good combinations with fresh, unexpected ingredients. I love the 80s soundtrack, my only complaint is that it was a bit too loud at night, so you had to scream to talk. The food is very good, kind of a modern take on comfort food. The brown bag chicken sandwich had a lot of flavor and the mac and cheese is done really well, just the amount of flavor and creaminess. The crab cake BLT was very good as well, the cakes were mostly crab, very fresh tasting.
5	What can I say...Maharaja Palace was my midday getaway while living out in Phoenix, and I miss it dearly.  I visit as often as I can (up to three times a year, traveling from Hawaii) and when I do, I am always astounded by the flavors and array of choices this buffet provides.  The tiki marsala happens to be my favorite dish and I find the staff to be accomodating and attentive, especially when ensuring Ive got enough naan to sop up my plates delightful curries.  I cant wait to return.  This is THE SPOT for Indian Food in the PHX Metro Area, hands down!
4	This Dutch Bros had some of the best customer service Ive ever seen from a young guy working on a holiday (Memorial Day). I ordered an Americano which was excellent and just the right proportions. My wife had a soy chai latte which was just a little too sweet, but still good. Overall, it was an experience I would recommend, and its staying on our list of go-to places as we explore our new neighborhood.
5	Saw this place on Triple D so I decided to give her try. My expectations were high and when I arrived I was shocked that on a Thursday morning the line was extra extra long. Had to wait patiently which when it comes to food I dont like.  But needless to say the wait was worth it because when I got in there I was served quickly. I ordered the pork chop, eggs, and hash browns.  The pork chop there is fabulous and the toast and home made grape jelly was good.  I would recommend this place for breakfast to anyone who is in the downtown area of Phoenix. Make sure to try the bacon too.
1	I had high hopes for this place, and it is really too bad because I love to support the Phoenix area restaurants, especially a Caribbean one and I had already been to the adjoining Rum Bar and loved the drinks, but the food was bad.  It was not only bad, but by all means avoid the daily market catch.  It was not fresh at all!  Very over priced!  For nearly $25 for a simple white fish they could have at least taken the bones out of the thing.  It tasted like it had been sitting around all day (or two) in its own juices, and when I let the waiter/bartender know he just ignored it and then ignored us until we left.  I will never be back for the food.  The Rum flights are worth a trip there, but that is it.
4	Prefer this place over other "clothing exchanges" in the area.  Friendly staff...store is usually pretty quiet when I go in which is nice as I cannot stand crowds! Mens selection is a little skimpy .. however when I go there its usually just to sell. On that note, they pay you 5% more of the retail value of any of your clothing than Buffalo does!  And, its always nice to be able to support local businesses!
2	I love the outdoor space at this restaurant. We had a very friendly waiter serve us. We started out with a delicious gin cucumber cocktail which was so refreshing. For an appetizer we had the chicken arugula flatbread that was tasty but definitely could of used a bit more flavor. The caesar salad made with kale was so salty that we were not able to eat much of it. The romaine salad was okay, nothing special. The entree, halibut was so dry it was totally inedible. The roasted vegetables were just so-so. I ate here in December and loved it but this time I was very disappointed. I am in no hurry to return, except for a drink.
4	Ok I have waited long enough to review Postinos...I have been here more than any other restaurant since I moved to AZ so I had to share my view on this place! I go to the Arcadia location most often so my review is based off of that.. This is me any one of my best gals Sunday spot...we go maybe twice a month and enjoy the Reggae, $5 Glasses of wine and of course the BRUSCHETTA!!...All of my fellow Yelpers have pretty much summed it up, all of their bruschetta is AMAZING!!! my favs are the brie with apples and the prosciutto with figs...I can eat that all day long...their sandwiches and salads are yummy as well...my next goal is to make it here for brunch :-) Overall very casual and laid back vibe parking is a bit tricky  great for dates, lunch, brunch, bdays, holidays...and the list goes on...
2	Ive only been here once, and for good reason. To put it nicely, the service was seriously lacking. I walked in and nothing. They didnt ask if I needed help looking for something, greet me, or even acknowledge me until I was about to pay. I guess the magazine the cashier was reading was VERY important. Ive been to several comic book stores and I dont need someone to hold my hand, I would just like common courtesy. On the positive it was a organized place and the selection was pretty good.
5	I chose this place because of the 100% rating on urbanspoon.com & the proximity to the hotel my family was staying at. We were absolutely blown away. Dont let the location of a strip mall deter you from this place. The food is absolutely perfect. I had the bouillabaisse while my 2 table mates had steak. Each dish was prepared perfectly. The service was also some of the best service we have ever had at any restaurant. The waitress was so attentive & detail oriented. I never had to ask for anything, she always knew exactly what I needed. My water & iced tea was never below halfway. At the end of the meal, the owner/chef came out to greet us & that was such a nice gesture. We were so happy to compliment him & his restaurant. My visiting family even said that they would gladly come back to this place on their next visit. This place is so great & you just need to go visit it!
3	This place wasnt quite up to scratch for me.  I had the foie gras sandwich.  It was pretty good, but I was still ravenous $10 later, so I top it off with a chocolate croissant ($2.75) which was also good.   Definitely a cute space with above average dishes.  But in the end there just wasnt enough bangs for my bucks.
5	...The best Pad Thai Ive ever tasted!!!  Crab Wontons melt in your mouth!!! Excellent service... GO !!!
4	I was one of a party of 13 for a birthday party on Saturday night.  Yep, I was odd man out again and in more ways than one as I will note in a bit.  We got started a bit after 7 and first we got our drinks and spent some time chatting and reading the menus.  Most of the folks there had been there several times before.  Everybody but me wanted pizza and wings so I ordered fettuccine Alfredo ($18.95) with salad and garlic knots.  I know its un American not to be a fan of pizza and wings.  Their antipasta arrived and I sipped on my beer.  Then the pizzas came, then the wings followed by my pasta.  Somehow my order got separated from the rest and I had to ask for my salad and bread which finally came last.  The side salad wasnt earth shattering but was solid and the garlic knots were nice warm pieces of bread.  The pasta was delicious.  I mentioned I was not a fan of pizza or wings but I was coerced in to trying both a pepperoni pizza slice and a couple of Giovanni wings.  Both were really good, the pizza was a thin  crisp in spots crust.  The wings had none of the heat I normally associate with wings.  I had to take some of the pasta and bread home with me.  After dinner there was warm Zepellies and the birthday girl got this huge ice cream/brownie/whipped cream thing which her husband and I finished most of.  If you followed along, you will note I ate a lot of different stuff and I paid for it for several hours afterward. For a large party we got quite good service except for my salad arriving late.  I just had the one beer (25oz) but most of the women were there to get their drink on and amongst them had several different mixed drinks and with one exception (weak) all were done well. This is a big sprawling place with 2 bars and more TVs than I have seen outside of Vegas.  The original space which is sort of set off from the rest of the area has pool tables and darts.  There is a good sized outdoor area too.
5	You know when you get a really good cut and color.. When the stylist is done and you look in the mirror and say "Wow, you did a great job. It looks awesome". Well that was my experience yesterday. I was a bit hesitant to go to the training academy, but in these rough economic times every penny counts and their prices are fantabulous.   It is really hard to find someone that does a great job on your hair the first time you see them. My stylist was Sara Groves and I am now a customer for life. I have the feeling she is going to have a very lucrative career doing hair, too bad her prices will triple in a few months. She sat me down and asked me all about my hair, my style, the products I use ect. The best part of the entire experience was that she really listened to me and cut my hair exactly how I asked. I wanted peek-a-boo highlights in my bangs, and even though she thought it was an odd choice (and asked me if I was sure a few times ;) she gave them to me. I was extremely pleased with both my cut and color. When the receptionist rang me up I almost couldnt believe the price.. Cut and color for under $50.. WOW!
4	I went thier on a new wave night. I dont drink so its hard to find somewhere gay that I can enjoy sober. They had bitchin 80s music and had a good guy/girl ratio. Some were straight but I like that, its nice when breeders what to hang out just for the fact that they wnat to hang out and dont care if your gay/straight. They also have a pool table wich is a rare find in gay clubs in az. I liked it :)
4	Finally, a pizza place that delivers to the Grayhawk area. Seriously, when I moved here over the summer and was unpacking I was shocked to learn that no one except Dominos delivers to Grayhawk. At all. Now, on my honeymoon in October I was in Giza, Egypt and saw that, if you stand with the Sphinx facing your back, you can see a Pizza Hut. Yes, that is correct, you can get pizza delivered to the Great Pyramids and Sphinx, but not to Grayhawk.  But, now we have Zpizza, and it is good. The pizzas range from the usual to more inventive things, such as the Casablanca, which has artichokes. They also feature organic and healthy selections, such as soy or low fat cheese and wheat or gluten free crust. They salads are also fresh and tasty and, while I have not tried them, they also serve sandwiches. Overall, a good pie, wide selection and it delivers!
1	I used to love Banana Republic.  I stopped by at lunch to buy a few outfits, I wasted quite a bit of time in this store...to an frazzeling degree.  The choppy layout of the new store is annoying.  The clothing line changed drastically so you look like you just came from an overpriced (and cold) beach.  I was looking to dress sharp and professional, not wrinkled and hap-hazzard.  I wanted short sleeves, not flimsy spagetti straps, long sleeved blouses and SWEATERS (hello..its JUNE...and ARIZONA.)  Banana Republics new format and collection is a huge FAIL.
4	We had a restaurant.com coupon.  They also have happy hour specials on appetizers.  You cannot combine specials with the coupon. We started with edamame and mussels.  I have never had mussels before, just oysters and clams.  The mussels were effin awesome.  They were not super chewy and the way they were seasoned and served, spicy and bold, was seriously amazing. Three of us polished off three different rolls.  Spicy tuna crunch roll, over the top.  What the heck roll, another spicy roll that was seriously good as H€LL!  Screaming roll, spicy tempura style shrimp roll with a delicious crunch.  Spicy is the way to go with sushi rolls. For dessert we went with mochi ice cream, served in four flavors: vanilla, strawberry, green tea and mango.  The green tea and mango were my favorites. Such a good dinner, now if only they served alcohol.
5	Saw CAKE there last year.  Nice grass, beautiful venue, great night!
5	Every item that I tried was amazing. Owner made it a pleasant environment and he had a terrific voice. A must try in Central Phoenix.
4	What can I say? Like the rest of joes restaurants, this place is great! Keep them coming Joe!
4	I absolutely LOVE the food from The Pitic! The place does look rundown and it is a rough neighborhood.. however those are the best places to eat arent they? Food is made fresh to order and out of the 10 or so years I have been coming here the quality of food never changes. It is great for families and actually anyone looking for a great mexican meal. Their crunchy beef tacos are to die for :)
5	Love it here!  Always unique and slightly dark art.  Definitely a go see if you are in phoenix~
5	I love the always smiling crew and food is delicious. 50cents coffee in the morning outside tables with sun exposure and friendly clientele, all this in the beautiful kierland commons Good morning America
5	Delicious food, amazing martinis, and wonderful desserts. Every dish I have eaten here has been nothing short of awesome. First, to start they have house infused seasonal vodkas. You can see the vodkas steeping on the bar when you walk in. Appetizers are not overly filling - The frito misto is always seasonal so depending on the time of year you will get different things. The coating is perfect and light so you can really taste the vegetables but still get the crunch. The same is true with the mozzarella. The cheese was fresh and the crunchy crust of fried coating around it was perfect.  As far as entrees go, the portions are perfectly sized and flavorful. The pasta is perfectly cooked and coated with whatever you choose on the menu. I love the simplicity of some and the complexity of others. Finally, desert has always been good. Try the limoncello cheesecake or any flavor of gelato and you certainly wont be disappointed.
5	We came here Sunday morning for a wonderful breakfast. Our server was Colleen. She was very attentive and we had  a great meal. The menu is so extensive with many ,many options. I got Florentine Eggs Benedict and my boyfriend had a fabulous omelet with potatoes and toast. They were both delish!     Their Potatoes are fab!!   The Decor was very nice, and even though they were so busy,we did not wait long at all for our table.  Big parking lot and a nice waiting area as well. We will defiantly come back here soon.
4	I enjoyed our dinner here although I think this might be more of a happy hour destination.  We had the trio of dips which were lovely.  I had the house enchiladas with grilled chicken and that was delicious.  The rice and beans left something to be desired.  Husband had the pork green chile mac and cheese which he enjoyed but felt was underseasoned.     I ordered the peach sangria on the recommendation of a friend but found it to be too wine-y for me.  I was expected a glass full of fruit as is customary and there was one tiny lone piece of peach clinging sadly to the bottom of the glass.  The waiter was kind enough to swap it out for the passionfruit sangria which I enjoyed much more.  I also tried the blood orange mojito and the coconut mojito.  They were both fabulous and LARGE!  If it were up to me, Id make them slightly less sweet but they were still fantastic nonetheless.   We shared the macadamia nut brownie and ice cream for dessert and that was wonderful.  The brownie was sort of like the bastard child between cake and a brownie.  Denser than cake, not as dense as a brownie.   Our server was wonderful.  Friendly, attentive, and helpful.
5	Being English and missing a lot of the things we cant get over here we were delighted to have found this place.  I have not tried all of the pasties and have stuck to the traditional ones that we get at home, i.e, cheese and onion and cornish and they are very good!!  I sent my husband there to buy their half baked ones so we could freeze them and have whenever we get the craving and I ended up ordering $80 worth without any regrets.  Needless to say my freezer is full of pasties and I even have a couple of ones I have not tasted before, so looking forward to trying those.  Have not eaten in the place either but quite frankly the food is that good I dont it would matter what its like inside.  Also just noticed this is the Mesa shop we have only bought from the newly opened on in Tempe.
5	This place was AMAZING!  I have stayed in probably over 100 hotels, this one was the BEST hotel I have ever been to... staff was extremely friendly, I WILL be back!
4	At least one a week. Cant go wrong.  My familys favorite chips & hot sauce anywhere. Wife loves the veggie burro.
5	are you joking? Where else can you get the best salami, ham, any cold cuts anywhere? I just moved here 6 months ago and have been searching for a place like this. Their meats are fantastic. I discovered this place after driving by it so many times. thought Id take a chance. Location is awful. but worth the trip.
5	Stopped in for the first time at PV Burger Company tonight.  It was quiet, only one table when I got there around 6:20pm.  Ordered a bacon havarti burger with fries and a coke; it came out to just over 9 bucks.   The burger came with lettuce, tomato, cucumber (???), pickled red onions, and thousand island.  It was DELICIOUS.  Beautifully toasted bun, great char on the meat.  The pickled onions were a nice touch.  The fries were skinny and crispy and had seasoned salt, which brings me back to being a kid and getting fries at the food court in the mall (good memories).  I got a refill on my coke before I left, so I dont know what another reviewer was talking about when they said there are no refills on sodas.  I asked and it was no problem. My only gripe is that after I had ordered and sat down to wait for my food, a couple of guys came in and the guy at the counter immediately handed them paper menus (with actual descriptions of the menu items Im sure, unlike the chalkboard on the wall), which I would have liked.  I probably would have gotten an add-on for my burger if he had given me a paper menu when I was at the counter.  Oh well, now I know for next time, because there will definitely be a next time in the near future :)
4	Fresh and Easys are great.  My only issues is how quickly some of the foods from this store go bad.  Dont buy for a week from now unless it is frozen!
3	Loved the room and its functionality but this same room made me want to punch myself in the face.  Im a young professional in his mid 30s who likes to party and understands what the W brand provides (especially on the weekends during moneymaker time) but when their DJ on Saturday night sounds like hes spinning from your bathroom, it makes for a tough stay.  Got home at 12:30 a little buzzed and had a rave in my head until 2am.  Finally got to sleep and loved the room and hotel otherwise, but this will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. Maybe its just a few rooms but 205 is a bad number here.
5	one of my favorite places !   the place has great atmosphere and character.  the bar is a great place to unwind with friends (or meet new ones) or have dinner.  Michael or Jan will take great care of you at the bar!    The full menu is offered here. the dining area is warm, elegant, & comfortable, but you are fine to wear your favorite blue jeans.....it is cave creek. you know! i have never ordered anything from the menu that did not impress.    regardless of where i dine, if there is a rib eye on the menu, i have to try it. Cartwrights rib eye (cooked over mesquite) is consistently  my favorite!!!     from the fish dept, the sea bass is succulent!     my second favorite is the scallops. they too are cooked over wood and have great flavor/texture and are seared perfectly. you have to save room for desert......the apple fritters pair well with their local fresh roasted coffee. you can not go wrong at Cartwrights!
5	Awesome Mexican food, fast service at drive in or sit in and eat...try the new fish tacos, theyre great, and authentic, too.
4	Great stop for a fast breakfast - the hubs had the puffed pancake with fruit on top (I LOVED how much fruit they loaded on it - and I got to eat it all because hubs doesnt like fruit so much). I got the oatmeal and a pastry - so good! The price was reasonable and I loved that it was all fresh and the flea market vibe the decor and seating offered. Free wi-fi is a bonus too!
5	Burger was delicious and fresh. Fries were well seasoned and crispy. Huge selection of bottled sodas from across the nation. Fun and good! Definitely coming back.
3	Singray is pretty good. The location is nice but there is never parking due to the other businesses around. Not fun walking so far in heels. :) The sashimi was pretty fresh, but miso was a little too salty. Also they gave us cold oshibori towels when we sat at the sushi bar. I think I prefer the new Pure Sushi location next to AZ88. Once I was able to find it. Very modern cool feel and awesome food. Heard Stingray is opening another location by my house. (Biltmore area) Maybe parking will be better.
5	Took Travis here for one of our first dates and just LOVE Cibo.  Its situated in a home from 1913 and has colored lights wrapped all around the trees.  You can either sit inside or on the gorgeous patio.  Brick oven pizza and cheese plates offered here and its definitely a place for a cool date.
5	MEOW! This place is great - super clean, loaded with an amazing assortment of natural foods for both pooches and kitties, and two fridges jammed full with raw diet selections!  My four-footed kids were in heaven going through the bags! Not wanting to offend anyone in my bunch (its impossible to travel anywhere with three dogs and two cats, while simultaneously maintaining any level of decorum), I went solo this weekend to support the latest AzRESCUE effort being sponsored by the store. In addition to them sending me home with a complimentary Yoghund for each of the kids, I got some great insight to private training that my youngest is in desperate need of if he ever hopes to be socially acceptable, and some great toys for the felines. The staff was unbelievably nice, they have some truly unique items, and the prices range from "wow thats pretty cheap" to OMG do I dare?!!! This is a great option to the chains and big box stores, so grab your leash, wag that tail, and pad your way on down to the Noble Beast!!!
1	The staff at this location was rude and unfriendly!! Also the store itself was not the cleanest I have seen!
3	ordered the steak sandwich (medium rare).  Came out cooked medium.  Still very delicious.  French fries were not good, way too salty.  Server seemed as though he did not want to be there, with a grouchy attitude.
4	Great sandwich
4	Great BBQ - Friendly staff, super atmosphere and reasonable prices - what else can you ask for?  Ribs and BBQ Chicken are my favorite.  Try the Devils spit sauce if you dare.
3	Cibo is a really adorable place, but I cant say that I think it is extraordinary.  The atmosphere and ambiance is totally five star, but too much goes wrong after that to give it an overall five star.   Food stuff:  Ive been twice and both times I liked it, but it wasnt love.  We got the bruscetta plate and I wasnt really thrilled.  The traditional tomato one was the most solid choice, the bean one was strange and soggy and I dont eat pig so I cant comment on the third one (though everyone else seemed to enjoy it). The pizzas are pretty decent except that they lay out the toppings in a weird way, for example, if you order the vegetarian rosa pizza, if you like zucchini, it is all chopped up on two slices and so on.  It doesnt really make sense to top a pizza in such a way, to me.  I prefer draft beer over bottled beer, and all they offer is bottled.  I did enjoy a couple glasses of the Rossi Cabernet Sauvignon which was a solid wine choice. Service:  The host/ess was a pleasant person, and the time quoted was less than we actually had to wait so that rocked.  While waiting, we attempted to get a drink.  The bartender was cool about getting our drinks in a timely manner despite the fact that it was busy.  Our actual server was super attentive at first and then lost for a good chunk of time as well.  Too hit or miss.   Cibo is an adorable spot with awesome ambiance but it isnt quite that awesome when it comes to food and service.
4	I only go for the movies or when I know what Im getting.  Not much of a shopper but I remember having fun here when I still lived in L.A. and came to visit.
5	I love the place.  Was a bit hesitant at first but friends recommended it, and it turned out to be quite good.  They even have a few choices for those that arent into Asian fare.
3	I really dont know how to rate Lolos, because, frankly, this place killed me.  It was only temporary, but I was definitely dead, heart stopped, for a solid five or six seconds.   Lolos is serious eats.  So good, it was just painful.  Literally.  I really dont think I can return anytime soon.  I know its for the best. Im nowhere near joking.
4	I remember my first visit to Delux,it was before heading over to shop in the craziness that is Last Chance. Anyway my friend suggested this spot because of their sweet potato fries...thats all she had to say, I was down!! Its a trendy little spot inside of a strip mall, it kinda looked outta place but it stood out in a good way. I ordered the sweet potato fries they were yummy (I like mine a little crispier, but they were still delish)  and the CHINESE CHICKEN SALAD...Mmmmmm the flavors were amazing, the red peppers, cilantro, romaine and that peanuty vinaigrette is too die for! I was a little worried that I wasnt going to get full but this salad was easily large enough for 2.Im ashamed to say that the 3 times that I have been to Delux I have had this salad, Im hooked. Next time I promise I will venture out and try one of these burgers everyone keeps raving about...maybe.
5	My review is only for the purchase of a non-disposable diaper at this swim school. As soon as I entered, I was promptly greeted and asked how they could help me. I explained that I was looking for a non-disposable diaper for my lilun and they asked about weight etc and found the perfect one for her.  The lady explained to me that the non-disposable diapers are so good that even if for some reason there is an accidental Code Brown, if you know what I mean, they will not charge their patrons. They really believe in the product that they sell.  Their swimming pool looks nice and clean and this could really be a fun place for little kids. I know they do parent and child classes here also.
4	Wife loved the ribs, BBQ chicken was ok. Service was awesome!  We were served by trainee Dawn being trained by Samantha. They were very fun!
4	My company is into giving back to the community, so they invited my department to volunteer at St. Marys during work-hours this week. It was a great experience and I would do it again! We filled boxes that get passed out to families in need. It makes me feel so good to volunteer and help others. And I feel so lucky to work for a company that supports and encourages this kind of service!  St. Marys was the first Food Bank in the world, they have expanded into a national effort. I also learned that 1 in 5 children wake-up and go to sleep hungry, 1 in 7 adults (18-64) have to decide between eating or buying things like gas/rent/bills/etc, and 1 in 12 seniors (64+) are struggling with bills/medical needs/food. Help someone else and make yourself feel great - volunteer!!
3	Not that good, not that bad.  So-so, more or less. Stopped by here for lunch the other day, I had the BBQ chicken lunch.  Overall a pretty bland taste, but maybe that is just the style.  If I ever end up here again I may try something else, but I wont be going out of my way to do so.
5	Went there last night with no expectations. From the beginning to the end, including the "bread basket" with blue cheese butter and pesto on top, the lamb chop appetizer, the sea bass entree, and the creme brulee in a flaky phillo cup lightly burnt on top, it was probably one of the best overall meals Ive had in years. Thanks Eddie for stopping by our table and checking on us and chatting a bit. Very friendly wait staff and no attitude whatsoever from anybody and very comfortable. This place is a model for how it should be done.
4	Pros: 1.  Excellent service.  Hell, its damned right impeccable.   2.  Superclean and comfortable rooms. 3.  Excellent amenities and top notch spa. Cons. 1.  J-Dubbs a little spendy on the cocktail side. 2.  KEEP THE POOL BAR OPEN LATER! MY GOD!!!  Id like to watch the sun set with a cocktail, rather than have the sidewalk rolled up around 5.
2	2 stars all because the hot sauce sucks now. 2 stars: 1 for a Buckeye Icon and 1 for most of the food is not bad.  Service is bad and slow. Servers are not trained in good service skills. Dirt parking lot sucks, be carefull not fall into one of the holes. Hope you are not handicapted and have to use the bathroom.....its outside and to the left, suprised the Building department OKd this place.
4	Great bagels & bialeys!  Service was great, food was fresh, bagels & bialeys were like NY! Ill be a regular here! Also check for specials on Tues & Fridays
2	We chose this place for breakfast this morning because of the wonderful reviews on yelp.  I was certain it was going to be one of my new favorite places.  We entered into a brightly painted orange restaurant and stood at the hostess stand for a few minutes waiting for the hostess to finish flirting with the server and notice us.  She clearly didnt want to be there and could care less where we sat, so opted for the table in the window.   We sat and waited and waited and waited.  Tables that were sat after us already had their drinks and they were not busy.  Finally I tried to get the attention of the hostess who was standing half asleep at the hostess stand, mouth open wide, eyes half closed.  A few minutes later we finally had a server. Our server was not very friendly.  I dont even think she said good morning.  We ordered.  Tables sat after us already got their food and we finally got our drinks.  She bought out 2 cups of coffee, but I did not order coffee so I made her take that back.  Our food finally arrived.  We ordered french toast which came with strawberries, bananas and a cinnamon sauce, eggs benedict with crab cakes and two orders of country potatoes.  Breakfast was pretty good.  I enjoyed my crab cake and the cinnamon sauce on the french toast was a nice added touch.  The potatoes were not good, they had WAY too much pepper on them, I couldnt even eat them.  Gary ate a few of his after he drowned them in ketchup. We never saw our server again.  We got a water refilled after we finished our meal.  AND THE WAIT BEGAN.  We waited and waited and waited for our check.  Tables that were sat when we finished eating had already finished their food.  We never saw our waitress. I guess we were her only table, if not I felt bad for her other tables as well.  Finally some guy brought us our check and tried to drop it off and run, I said WAIT and gave him my card and said, "If I dont give this to you now it may be 20 more minutes before we see someone again" Because I didnt look at the bill first when he brought it back I didnt notice until after I paid that they charged me $12.05 for the eggs benedict when their menu actually said $10.50.  I didnt say anything...  I just left a sad tip. We were there for OVER an hour, they had lots of empty tables, and we only saw our server once. Gary and I always over tip, because he and his family owned restaurants in the Valley for 35 years.  He has spent a lot of time being a chef and serving tables.  We know that when food comes out wrong, its probably not the servers fault, and things happen, so we still tip well.  TODAY, I felt like we were invisible and I have no idea where our server disappeared to for the hour.   We drove by Over Easy, La Grande Orange and IHOP to try this place.  We probably will not be back... unless we decide to give it a second try on jazz night... I do love jazz.
4	The "hood" is a colloquialism not intended to imply "ghetto" or any particularly dangerous neighborhood. I am a proud resident of the Biltmore hood and my neighbors are retired Mormon doctors who all own corgis and drive Buicks and have umbrellas with "Vanguard Investments" emblazoned on them. Anyway, even though the neighborhood isnt particularly risky its dangerous just having this place so close to me. After a particularly harsh day at work I treated myself to the carne asada burro combo. Highly addictive, and theres probably enough fat in the tortilla alone -- never mind the filling -- to keep me and an African village or two going for a week or so. Nevertheless, its delicious and a great antidote to an evening spent with too much single-malt and too many cigars and some women named Wanda and Clarissa. Those who know . . . . know . . .  Anyway, go and enjoy.
4	Oh boy.  I was terrified of this place.  Curry peanut butter?? Sun dried tomato peanut butter?? Sick!  But once I went, I shockingly realized that somehow, it wasnt thaaat bad. While this is without a doubt, a place that little kids will LOVE to come to and one that adults will grudgingly take them to, if you have to eat here and youre over 12, I recommend getting the veggie sandwich.  It was the least scary lunch option on the menu that wasnt going to taste like a dessert.  It had sun dried tomato peanut butter, lettuce, cucumbers and cheese.  And it wasnt half bad.  But it wasnt half good either.  Lets just say I was surprised that it wasnt disgusting, but I wouldnt go back again unless I had to take another little kid I was babysitting.  The child in question, a little girl by the name of Natalie, is my friends daughter and she talked me into going here.  She couldnt say more about the place- she loves it!  And for lunch, she had some white chocolate peanut butter, banana, nutella and caramel concoction that made me sick just looking at it. But if you want to bring your little one somewhere different and fun that they will love you for, come here.  This would be a cute spot to have a little birthday lunch for your kids with a couple pals that wouldnt cost much at all.
4	Fun bar. Gets PACKED during happy hour, and on weekends after 9pm. Sometimes the music is a little too loud to hold a dinner conversation. But hey maybe Im just getting old. The sushi is CONSISTENTLY good, above average good. Yes, as other reviewers noted, you can find better. But no other sushi place Ive been to in Arizona can consistently serve up good fish every time I come in.
1	Just dont.
3	Side Door, West on Hayde, a small location that does it right.   If you respect the Chicago area you will recognize Vienna beef right away.   I really enjoy the italian beef at this location, its hard to find a place that serves Italian Beef (see Defalcos Scottsdale Rd).  Bianca was our server and was very helpful for my first time, at the restaurant. If you live in the area check this place out for a quick bite to eat.   Where are all the other reviews?
1	Great in its day, now leaves a lot to be desired.  Deserves credit as a Phoenix landmark Chinese restaurant.   This restaurant has been here for 38 years.  Ive been going here off and on for 35 years.  I go here more for sentimental reasons, and not so much for the food.   The interior still retains some of the original decoration style from the original restaurant established nearly 40 years ago.  The rest of the decorations have been torn out.  I believe the decor is modeled after the Forbidden Palace in Beijing - see the vault-of-the-heavens style crenelations in the ceiling.   I have this restaurant - in its former self - to thank for this:  Back in its day, this restaurant was really great, and the entire atmosphere lent to an ambiance that actually inspired me to study Chinese and then later go live over there for some years.  Sadly, the food here is not all that good.  The fryer oil they use here is pretty old.  The fried rice arrives looking almost black (from the fryer oil?  too much soy sauce?) instead of a rich golden brown, and tastes overcooked somehow.  The eggrolls are just OK.  Definitely not fresh. A lot of the menu items from the original owners are no longer on the menu; for example the special "Chinese cakes" served on a plate topped with a delicious gravy-like brown sauce and shallots - probably some form of Cantonese food.  All of this is gone, and replaced by very plain fare, and not very good at that.   If you like salty, greasy, plain-tasting yet somehow edible Chinese food not far from the $1-per-scoop variety, then go here.  Golden Phoenixs heyday as a great restaurant is long-gone.  Let us bow our heads in sadness to a place that once was very good - now passed on...
5	This place is classic goodness! Everything tastes rich and fresh! Has a new modern feel with a twist of luxury and artistic flare. The food presentation is gorgeous and the food tastes even better then it looks! In a wonderful area of town and is built in the old post office. An inventive and one of a kind idea has really set apart this delicious place from any other restaurant in the valley!
5	These guys are great.  I had an old Craftsman mower, probably 8yo, that even sat unused in a basement for a couple years.  It coughed and wheezed, barely even turning over.  I brought it to them and now it works (and even looks) brand new!
5	Stopped in here for lunch today joined by Mike C. & Robyn N.  This was my third visit ever to a CB & the first time to this one.  I went with a Reuben Sandwich Plate, which included a cup of Cole Slaw & a cup of Beefy Cabbage Soup.  The service was good at this location, the atmosphere fun, the food delicious & the prices reasonable.  5 Stars!     :-)) Reuben Sandwich Plate $8.19
5	i hate going to places that i can goto near home, in Phx for the Cubs games.. but my daughter wanted pizza and we saw Z and had to go becuz we know how good it is. I like this one alot better then ours.
5	YOWZA! I love this place. I had heard great things about this place before and actually received some of the olives and olive oil as a gift last year. I decided to take my mom and try it out for lunch. The food was pretty good, but the best thing for me is that they have Cerignola olives! This was music to my ears when they told me they had them. I have been looking everywhere, checking every grocery store, gourmet shop in Chandler and Tucson and nobody has them. I cant wait to go back and try the rest of their menu! Oh and expect a little off roading, the parking lot is loose gravel :)
3	Dinning here since 2003 Wings: Big and flavor full, special wing prices on Monday.              Some of the biggest wings around, includes: celery and ranch or blue cheese.            Four star wings.  Pizza:  Delicious!!  A medium is 14" and the crust is thin, and foldable, New                 York style... with LOTS OF HOT CHEESE.  Four star pizza. Fried zucchini:  Complete disappointment, for $5.XX ( $5 something)  you receive                             8 small zucchini rounds.   Chicken Tenders:  Dry, small, inadequate.  Beer, Pitcher of:  ICE COLD, delicious draft.  ************ Atmosphere:  Mom n Pop Shop... this place permeates family owned.  There are                       usually only 2 people working, one in the front and one in the back.                       Definitely the kind of place where you dont want to piss anyone off, and                       they might have a shotgun under the bar... Service: The waitresses are attentive and very close if you need additional service. ************* Will I Return?  Yes, I love those wings!!! Ugh... And the pizza, yum.  I just wont                        order appetizers.
1	Door clearly says drive-thru open 24 hours and lobby till midnight. Drove up at 10:30 and was told the lobby was closed...lame...
2	First of all, the hours, this place keeps the most absurd hours for a restaurant serving 50,000+ students and faculty.  I cannot tell you how many times Ive walked over to get a sandwich and Sacks has been closed.  They open sometime in the morning and close at about 2 or 3 in the afternoon, I cant report definitively what the hours are because they do not list them on Sacks website, apparently they are trying to keep it a secret.  I understand a sandwich shop in downtown Phoenix keeping these hours, but here is an update for the owners of Sacks: ASU students and faculty do not keep bank hours. The quality of the food is substandard but the sandwiches are priced reasonably.
5	Wow this place is fabulous.  Everything is so fresh and tasty that you can enjoy a healthy and yummy meal without breaking the bank.  The salad bar is huge and they have a fresh soup bar where you can choose numerous varieties of homemade soups.  Great tasting desserts and frozen yogurt machine.  Best Strawberry Lemonade I have ever tasted.  You have to try this place you will not be disappointed.  They need to open locations in the Midwest. Also, I want to give a shout out to the server at the restaurant.  His name is Oscar and he is so wonderful and funny.  He made us all laugh and smile and Oscar is such a hard worker and everyone that visits this location has to say hello to Oscar because he is the nicest man ever!
4	Large menu with huge portions.  Crowded, enjoyable atmosphere.  Great bakery. Somewhat pricey but worth a trip.  Food was good.  Had breakfast the Spanish Omelet & a breakfast sandwich made of eggs, bacon, cheddar on 2 potato pancakes; bagel with cream cheese.  All were fresh & plentiful.  Sandwiches are huge as well.  Offer "healthier" choices as well.
4	I used the drive thru early one morning on my way to work. I ordered a breve latte. It came as expected and was very good. A little pricey but Im cheap. I hope this place stays in business. Its nice to have a neighborhood coffee shop thats not a chain. The drive thru option is great too.
4	My eyebrows definitely needed some love...Ive ignored them so long that theyre starting to resemble 2 fat caterpillars and Ill soon risk a uni-brow if something isnt done stat.  Did you say FREE waxing? Im a sucker for free stuff.  The center is very sterile - not only in a clean and sanitary way, but also void of any personality. Its a chain though and theyre trying to go for the European vibe so Ill let them off the hook.  The gal who did my wax was really nice, wore surgeons gloves, and carefully applied this purple gooey wax to my face, waited for it to dry, then pulled it off. It hurt a lot less than regular wax, and the fact that it was purple made it just seem cooler all around. I walked out 15 minutes later with clean brows and an appointment for my next wax. Definitely a good find.
3	Asi-Asi ,Menza-Menza,Comme ci Comme ca...you get the jist . So -so ..(a solid so-so ). He liked the tacos ,i liked the steak salad ( it had a nice little kick to it) Service was good.The atmosphere just wasnt my cup of tea ,that said ,i can see why some people like it here .Drinks were solid,menu was decent . Good place to get hammered ,I suppose. I had a Pinneapple mind eraser that was ......
5	I brought in six pairs of shoes to Ariel to see if he could put new heels on them (I wear the spiky-heeled high heels).  For $12, not only did Ariel put new heels that perfectly matched each color, size and type of heel (and even filed them just a hair so that they would wear smoothly), but he also put a lot of work into fixing the front of them.  Many of my shoes had toes that were worn, shredded or faded; Ariel made them like absolutely new.  Amazing! My shoes are not Prada or Gucci.  They are mostly Nine West with leather uppers and man-made everything else.  :)  However, Ariel took amazing care of them as if they were "the kings" shoes.  It is so great to have my favorite pairs of shoes back.  I will return.  Thank you, Ariel!
1	This review is based solely on service - not the food.  I am sitting in a booth at RA as I type this - that is how upset I am with the host staff at ra. I called ahead to inform the restaurant that we would have a party of 8. When we arrived the girls at the front were so rude I almost walked out. We waited 35 min for our table and the entire time the host staff was looking my entire group up and down giving us the "stink eye". I am sorry that you are 18 years old, work for $8 and have a stick up your butt, but do not make us feel unwelcome. My girlfriend and I went to the back to use the bathroom - the host followed us back and asked us what we were doing - not to help us find the bathroom but just to be a snob. From here on out ra is ruined for me.
4	Worth a visit. This is good food, not good people watching.  Think: Colorado take on southwestern food.  Ate: Pork Green Chili app. Grub. Little kettle of the stuff with four fresh made tortillas that arrive folded in a white paper bag - hot. 4.7/5 for flavor, quantity, value, and presentation.  "Big Ass Burger."  All made in house. Even the bun and fries. I dont think they keep the cattle there though. Burger was loosely packed, over-cooked, and a bit salty for my taste. But I am a critic. Jen thought it was average too. Also now $13 - was $10 6 mos ago according to other reviews. 2.75/5 "Huckleberry Bread Pudding."  Whoa. Like a hot gooey berry muffin with Ice-Cream. Awesome. Jen thinks it might be her favorite dessert of all time. 5/5 We were a little worried when we saw all the snow-birds in their ivy caps and studded mom jeans. Turned out to be just fine - and the service was pretty special for how reasonably priced everything was. Portions were serious - Jen and I shared everything and were stuffed. Cant imagine orgering your own app, entre, and dessert. No way.  Sorry about the typos. Its bright out here in the Scottsdale sun by the pool...
4	On a mission to find some University of Michigan apparel that fit my pregnant body, I started my search with a phone call to Sports Authority.  I struck out there within minutes as I was told that they only carry AZ team apparel.  Shucks! Luckily for me, Lindsey F overheard my conversation and suggested I call Bischoffs Shades of the West.  She remembered seeing a ton of college apparel during her last visit to this touristy store with all kinds of inventory including Western wear, food products, jewelry, etc... I skeptically called and sure enough, Bischoffs carries UofM apparel as well as all kinds of sports paraphernalia including hats, t-shirts, shorts, keychains, and more from the NCAA, NFL, NBA, NHL, and more! I headed over that afternoon and found what I was looking for... and now I know where to go when on the hunt for all kinds of random items from AZ novelty gifts to college football attire.  Thanks Bischoffs, and "go blue!"
5	Most amazing service! The food is common pho and buns but the main attraction is what drew me in its not your typical Vietnamese restaurant its a SPRING ROLL BAR!! Fantastic drinks! Great addition
4	Food was delicious, portions were great, and price was very reasonable! Highly recommend
5	My wife and I have a timeshare nearby and when we were doing a morning walk we saw this place and we asked our concierge she raved. We went and fell in love with the place. The service, the food, the friendship. We go back every time we are in town and the staff remembers you. Also my wife loves gnocchi and says that these are as good as her grandmothers.                                    Dave A
5	Awesome, delicious lunch or dinner takeout place! Quite a dive in terms of decor, so dont expect anything fancy. There are folding tables and chairs, if I remember correctly. Anyway, I had jade red chicken and emperors chicken quesadilla and both were SO GOOD. The idea of Chinese - Latino food sounds odd, but Id heard of it before and just never had the chance to try it. They have all sorts of combos, mostly with beans or rice as a side (get it? chinese and latin food both usually come with rice....!). So before you knock it, if youre in Phoenix and looking for a place to eat, this is it!
4	Great! came here with my girlfriend and my mom and left very satisfied! We ordered some of there apparently famous bruschetta, some panini and a bottle of their Zweigel wine from Austria and it was all fantastic! I highly recommend going there and at least getting some wine and bruschetta if nothing else, it is well worth you time! Keep singing, -Jerron
1	Soggy flavorless pizza served on unwarmed ceramic plate. Carbonara was watery and made with cream instead of eggs. Gnocchi was tough as opposed to light and airy.
3	Had lunch here a couple of days ago.   Place was dead.  Only one other table had people at it.  Service was quick.  Reuben sandwich I ordered was delivered promptly.  Meat was tasty but not exactly plentiful (Im used to a New York style Reuben - with loads of meat).  Potato salad that came with the sandwich was very good, a pleasant surprise.   Outdoor seating was nice, though the birds did get tiresome.  Place seemed clean.  Plenty of seats.  Upstairs deck area would be great in the evening.  Seems like it would be a much more fun place with a group of people for happy hour  or dinner than it was for lunch.   Bottom line - it was okay.  Not bad, not great.  Id give it another try but I wouldnt go out of my way to eat there again.
3	Here is my honest assessment of Los Reyes de la Torta.  Its a three-star place.  The atmosphere is a bit dumpy.  My apologies to those who think reviews should focus strictly on food, but atmosphere is what I notice when I walk in the door.  Plus, despite the fact that the place was mostly, we were led to the table closest to the restrooms.  Seriously?   The star of the show here is obviously the tortas.  I tried the egg one, which had cheese and a very generous serving of sliced avocados.  This torta was delicious and a great value.  The other one I tried had chicken, onions, and some other stuff.  It reminded me of what they have at the Great Steak and Potato Company.  Not that thats a bad thing.  For the tortas I give 5 stars.   Other stuff: No alcohol.  Nuff said. Greasy potato chips as a side?  That was kind of a bummer.  I was craving tortilla chips or fries or anything a little more exciting than potato chips right out of the bag. The flan was really dense and tasted like it was prepared forever ago in a huge vat.  Skip it.  You probably wont be hungry anyway after the tortas so dont get tempted by the pictures on the menu.
1	Wow.....  Not in a good way The sashimi was good because all they did was cut it, but that was it.everything else made me wish I went real Chinese! Not Chinese making sushi, culture theives! P.S. snow crab is not the main ingredient to every roll!
4	Good coffee and they always take care of what i need in a timely manner. Never mind the fact it is literally 20 yards from my front door, but that may play into my liking of the establishment.  Either way you should check it out and enjoy some free Wifi.
4	One of those places that can not possibly serve bad food...! Lunch, specifically, is very nice, quick and affordable... All their curries as well as entrees are equally good and you can ogfcourse adjust the level of spice as in all Thai places... ( thats something I dont like but serves good for those who dont eat spicy food)... Thai coffee is one of my favourites too...
4	Im 2 weeks new to Phoenix. I looked up Irish bars in town and found Rosies. The decor and ambience was outstanding. I went there by myself on a Wednesday night in hopes of finding some friendly folks and that is exactly what happened. I ate dinner at the bar. Marcy was the bartender and she was very friendly and helpful and she introduced me to a whole bunch of people. For dinner I had a Rueben sandwich, which was pretty large and very good. I had a a small Rosie salad as my side and it did the job. I wish it was made with lettuce other than iceburg, but the bacon & eggs & other toppings helped a whole lot. I drank a nice, cold Smithwicks from the tap. Followed that up with 2 vodka tonics and my whole tab was under $25!  The basketball game was on when I first got there. After the game, the jukebox was playing a fabulous mix of the best oldies. Around 10pm a live band played. I didnt catch much of their performance but I did notice that I really like the singers voice and thats rare for me since I dont typically care for female vocalists. All the people I spoke to were super nice and very welcoming. I am sure I will see a bunch (or all) of them again and I look forward to that!
5	The best burgers in Phoenix. The owners are great and am on a first name basis. Forget about fast food and support this local business.  Go double. Add bacon. Park at Circle K if in a hurry. Plan on holding it until you get home. Stick to the burger and fries, genius.
4	This was my first half marathon.  I enjoyed the music the buzz of tens of thousands of people all about to do a crazy long run.  It was amazing seeing the sunrise over the city.  I found the parking, shuttles at Tempe and food-court to be very easy to use.  It seemed well planned for such a large event, just not enough bathrooms for the amount of people. The PA for the full marathon kept going in and out so it introduced the 2 star athletes but you couldnt hear their reason for being there or accomplishments.  Bathrooms on the course were way too few and huge lines.  I felt bad for those who needed them.  I saw less than 10 at the first 2 stops for 12000 people.  If you gotta go #2 on the course, too bad,...  Take Imodium on race day I guess. Bands and support were fantastic, but this was my 1st time so cant compare.... GU gel is always on me, great to see them out there. The course is NOT flat having a heartbreak hill in it at mile aprox. 9.  UPS gear check bag split apart at a feathers touch the day before the race.  Good thing, i was going to use it.  The top of the seam isnt sealed so any slight pressure/tear will open the entire side.  Ha ABOUT THE AUTHOR-INTERESTING BACKGROUND My first endeavor was a rolerblade marathon in tucson in 2004.  I guess its out of style now so no more skates.  Used to do the New TImes 10k in phoenix every year too.  GONE, sad. Last year I did the Tour de Phoenix 72 mile bike race on a 33lb. full suspension (no lockouts) mountain bike with slime in both tires and all my supplies on my bike and camelback... thought i was tough, till I tried running!  Injuries were now a new thing now and it is much tougher per hour than biking, but about the same calorie burn... Still love both. I did a sprint triathlon recently too. We all know running is hard you dont get extra calorie burn from impact stress but something about running and especially in this event captured my interest.  On the way to the zoo last year i saw the half marathon pass by and said "I think i could do that NOW" boy was i wrong... it took me almost a year to train for this event, but what a worthwhile challenge.   I did this as a run walk 3 min run 1 min walk.  I learned from the Galloway training method that this method is not only easier but faster than trying to run straight through.  .I am capable of the constant run for this time but it winds up being slower than when i take walk breaks. I tested this with a 10k distance. I was 7 minutes faster with a run walk than running straight through.  look it up, may change your life too.  I took 50 1 minute walk breaks and i did my time goal of aprox. 2:30 with 1 bathroom break.
5	Move over Maizies youve been replaced...for brunch that is. I have a tradition with a lucky few of at least once a weekend going to Maizies for their brunch and getting smashed. Oh, and we eat a little too. Everything changed this weekend though when we went to Postino on Central for their brunch debut. The food was so ridiculous good, that we actually forgot to drink. Did you hear me?? FORGOT TO DRINK!! Since it was our first time there, we ordered a variety of options. I had the Country Toast, which was toasted MJ Bread, topped with Italian Ham, Gruyere Cheese, and a sunny-side up egg. Ho-ly shit. Each bite became increasingly better than the last. It was the perfect bite over and over and over again. The ham had a nice little spice to it, the gruyere cheese had an intoxicating tang to it, the egg was, well, an egg, and the toast really brought it all together incredibly. And it was huge. I barely got through half if it before I had to give up. My brunch date got Postinos take on French Toast. To be honest, I am not huge on sweets first thing in the morning, however I would have bathed in this french toast. It was creamy, not overly sweet, and literally melted in my mouth. I ordered a White Peach Bellini at the beginning of our meal per norm and while it was spectacular with actual peach puree in the bottom of my champagne flute, I completely ignored it after the first bite of my meal. Me. Ignoring anything in a champagne flute. I know. I feel a bit like the blase housewife who just cheated on her husband for the first time with the pool boy, but Im sorry Maizies, consider me shacked up with said pool boy every weekend in the early hours from here on out!
5	Jon, Tess, Charlie, Erin, Kathleen and whole gang are the best!!!
2	The food is fairly good.  Thats why its such a shame that the service sucks!  Every time I have gone there, they take forever to bring you water, take your order, bring out food, everything - even when you are the only people in the entire place.  They are always unfriendly.  Out order has been incorrect on a couple occasions.  I really wish they had better service.  I just wont go there anymore because of that.
4	Youd think it would be easier to find good Chinese take-out but its not..  Luckily, Great Wok fits the bill.  Its not super expensive, they give you a ton of food and its really good!  I usually get the General Tsos chicken and its hot, covered in sauce and cooked right.  The beef and broccoli is good too.  Its a typical small Chinese food joint in a strip mall so the dining room isnt anything special.  I stick with take-out.
5	AWESOME!!!  I love this place! I am from Seattle and Ive been struggling to find a good pho restaurant since moving out here. Khai Hoan reminds me of some of the restaurants I used to go to back home.  I love hole-in-the-wall family restaurants like this one. No fuss, no frills. Just good food and fast service.We were greeted, seated, ordered and got our appetizer in 10 minutes. Food was delicious!!! Definitely go here!
2	Im from Philly and had to stop in when I found out a Ritas was open. It wasnt exactly what I had remembered, Flavor was just OK and not as intense. Not bad, but not great. I prefer Repiccis Italian Ice. They dont have their own store, but its carried at Cookiez on Mill in Tempe and also they are at a lot of festivals in the valley. You can also find quarts and pints at AJs markets. Just glad there are finally some good Italian Ice options for us East Coast folks out here in AZ!
4	Loved the spinach salad.  Ill have to find out what kind of dressing that was in it.  Yumm  The beer selection is the first thing that I would come back for.  We ordered the Gourmet White pizza which has: Olive Oil and Garlic base pizza with Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Provolone, Mozzarella, Feta, Roma Tomatoes and Onions. Yummy. Especially the crust, which is a wheat crust that compliments the pizza very well.  Nothing left on my plate!  Hope to try the meatier, yes, I made up that word, pizzas next time!
5	Ive been a bunch of times for takeout and took a seriously picky foodie friend this past weekend.  Everything Ive had here has been excellent and I mean, excellent.   In the past Ive had the margherita pizza, eggplant parm and fried calamari.  All good.  This weekend we had the comp tapenade, beef carpacchio, lasagna and one of the pizzas (cant remember name -- had olives, art hearts, ham and ?).  All delicious.  The lasagna was so delicate but melded perfectly with the sauce. My very particular picky friend LOVED the place.  Seriously loved it.
5	Simply magnificent. Easily the best Mexican food Ive had the pleasure of enjoying in the States. I cant stop thinking about the carne asada Torta. The rice and beans are the best Ive eaten. Tacos are simple and delicious. The most exciting part about it is that I get to go back and try the famed Bombero Burrito and other, more "exotic" things like the lengua and menudo! You must go!
4	Man of man this place is gooodd - I hurt when I leave from eating their awesome beef tacos, these are from god.  They deep fry them and the beans are cheesy perfection.  So if your trying to lose weight or looking for healthy, not this place, this is the place where you sin. Red cheese enchiladas hit the spot!   The service is great and the prices are low, of course the building could be better.  Great for pick up also.
5	Tried a little if everything.  The bars are worth the drive across town unbelievably good.  The bars have a moist short bread crust, it is absolutely addictive.  The strawberry cupcake was perfection.  Cookies were very good but the bars and cup cakes stole the show.  Thank heavens it is not closer to home :)
2	Blah Food is boring and sub par in my book The ambiance is chill and super trendy Scottsdalish The drinks are all old time drinks.  Think Slow Gin Fizzes, Rusty Nails and Manhattans The service is good though
4	An unclear menu and chalkboard signage, as well as lack of information from our server, lead to confusion. Like most have said before, my friend and I were very pleased with the atmosphere at Tryst Café in terms of its decor and layout. However, information about specials on the menu and two separate chalkboards lead to confusion about what specials were available (given the day of the week and hour of the day.) When we inquired with our server, she didnt know and had to double check what was included, when specials were available and for what price. Im not sure if she was new to this job or just insufficiently trained. Fortunately, Tryst Café delivered in other ways. The drinks were sufficiently strong. My friend tells me her two glasses of Montpellier Cabernet Savignon (pictured) were delicious. My Tryst Pepino was fine, though was missing the mint garnish described on their menu. The Humus Trio (pictured) was delicious and came with slices of fresh cucumber however, it did not come with the traditional side of pita bread which had to be ordered separately. The Steak Salad (pictured) was amazing and the chunks of meat were oh, so, tender and juicy! I hope to revisit Tryst Café sometime soon. My only hope is that they clear up some of the confusion about what specials are available and appropriately train their staff to know what is actually included, when specials are available and for what price.
1	Wish I could review this place on service but I wasnt able to get one.  Walked in at 1 PM on a Sunday afternoon for a mani pedi, was told by the front nail tech to have a seat.  I get it, I walked in on a Sunday afternoon so they are going to be busy and I am fine to wait.  My wait turned into 30 minutes and no one said a word to me.  Then the front nail guy tells me it is going to be another 20 minutes before someone would be able to get to me.  You know your salon, you know your techs and how long it will take them to do a service as well as how many people are in front of me so it would have been nice to have gotten a expected wait time before I wasted an hour my time.  I ended up leaving and going to another salon who saw me right away   The place in general was dirty, nail polish spilled down the wall and dust everywhere.  I did not get to see how clean their pedi baths and chairs were but the front waiting and front desk area was filthy.
4	We had a delicious meal with great service.  Awesome!
2	I have been eating at Wildfish since it opened and after my most recent Saturday evening dining experience, I must say, the quality of both the food and service have gone way downhill.  I know....a busy Saturday night and so, perhaps I should give both the servers and chef a break? Sorry. The menu has changed and so has the quality of food - and not in a good way. Let me just give you a brief sample of our experience - the Ahi Tuna Tartare appetizer has been changed to a lackluster combination of flavors. The idea of tuna with mango seems lovely however there is a total and complete blandness to the way this dish is now served. The former tuna appetizer was far more tempting. Moving onto the Goat Cheese Medallion Arugula salad. My salad was served sans medallion and literally laden with a huge glob of cold goat cheese and some terribly prepared mushrooms. What happened to the warm, crusted goat cheese? Next, we both ordered the Parmesan Crusted Sole. While the sole was prepared well, I do not recall this dish having a cream based sauce in the past. If memory serves me well, the dish should have had a lemon sauce delicately balancing the flavor of the fish. Cream and sole do not make a happy pair!  I am not sure if this was an error or part of the new menu. Okay, and for the piece de resistance we ordered a side of the Sugar Snap Peas which were actually drowning in a bath of some kind of soy and oil sauce. It actually made me ill to eat it - and my companion, as well.  Our service was slow and unattentive - although I do realize service can be a very personal experience.  I was sick with food poisoning all day Sunday - as if the poorly prepared food were not enough to bring down my joy.  So, I caution those of you who may have once enjoyed this restaurant like me - think twice before dropping a pretty penny at Wildfish.
5	Superb gelato - some of the best Ive ever had! The guy behind the counter is the owner, and he takes pride in his gelato. They only use real sugar, not high fructose corn syrup, and nothing contains hydrogenated oil. I tasted a few flavors and settled on the coconut... it was sublime.  Definitely some of the best Gelato I have ever had. When I need a mid day sugar rush... Ill be back!
4	This place ROCKS! Its a little loud, but its worth the visit.  Granted, I cannot pronounce half of the things on the menu, but the Jalapeno Cilantro hummus is to-die-for delish.  The Greek salad is awesome, as are the gyros.  Ive never made it past the hummus, gyros and salad, but it is consistently great food and quick service.  Always busy, but isnt every good restaurant?  Go! Its yummy! This location is my favorite, as I think the one at Desert Ridge has slightly different tasting food (on the negative side of different tasting, that is).
4	I came here on Saturday becuase I had to get my Jeep serviced, and I wanted to check this dealership out.  I made an appointment, and dropped my Jeep off in the sevice bay. I was greeted when I walked into the dealer, and I had a decent experience here.  I DO have to say, that I didnt like waiting 3 hours, but that seems to be at most any dealership you go to for warranty work, so I cannot blame them for that. What I DONT like is going for service and tying to be "sold" on a new vehicle. Im in for service, not to buy or trade in my car.  Why do the salesman do that?  I know its thier job to sell, but not every single time.  Geez.  Annoying.
5	This place is a gem. The food is amazing. Its cheap. The service is good. My favorite part? The place never changes. I can walk through the door and Ali already knows my order. The Chicken Shawarma special comes with their hand-made pita - so soft and delicious. The chicken is seasoned perfectly and comes with a yummy little dollop of garlic sauce. Ive never found better hummus in my life. Ive had it all around town, in New York, in L.A. (ick...L.A. *shudder*). SO good! The iced tea has a hint of rose water. OH and the gyro? Hands down, the best in town. Did I mention they have a market attached? Talk about the best price on spices in town! The spices come in little plastic sealed pillows, so get some spice jars from Ikea and stock up! I couldnt get through this without mentioning the lamb tongue. I am no connoisseur of organ meats, but this sandwich is like the most tender lamb youve ever had in your life. Shut up and try it. The only sad part about Hajis is that they close early. Usually 8pm on a week-night, but totally worth getting to-go orders if you can swing in on your way home from work!
5	Good food, great atmosphere, great service and great prices! We will definitely be back! Cant wait to try the Sunday Brunch!
2	If you have a family with a lot of little kids, are absolutely happy with your body, and only want to leave your house to change your scenery, this is your place. If you are looking for a great workout, this is not your place. The hours are pretty bad and you have to plan your schedule around them. The cardio machines are good. The variety of weights is okay but they are all over the place. They have a suggestion box, but they dont take them seriously. The classes used to be good, but now the quality has gone down. The zumba class used to be my favorite, but not so much anymore. They should have different levels, but there is only one and it is slow. There are kids all over the place. I dont understand what parent would want their 6 year old girl learning to shake her butt, but I cant judge, I dont have a kid. Maybe when I have one I would want her to learn to dance low and shake it, so she can be asked to go on MTV. The majority of the classes are in the middle of the day, which is great if you dont have a job or anything to do with your time. Yoga? there were a couple good instructors, but they are not there anymore. What do you guys do to your instructors? Why do they run away? Why do you make it hard to get a good workout? I dont think I am asking for much here, just a place that I can get a good workout.
5	This is a real find and I mean "find"  because it is tucked away on the side streets of downtown Glendale. This small little restaurant is unique in decor and cuisine, not many polish restaurants around.  The food is flavorful and fresh, the soups are unique and tasty.  The stuffed bell peppers are awesome as is the stew.The owners are warm and inviting without being overbearing.   My only disappointment is the limited hours, I work too far away to get there for lunch and they are only open a few nights a week.  Definitely worth the trip.
3	Nice place...Need more restaurants..! Pretty huge airport...so long walks..!
5	I cannot say enough good things about this place! The food is amazing and the customer service is probably the best Ive ever experienced. Every time my boyfriend and I dine here the owner visits with us and asks how we are, etc. Ive only had Pho at a couple of places in town so I cant speak to the authenticity but it tastes amazing and fresh every time. Places that make good food and offer the kind of customer service these places do (and family owned is always a plus for me!) are just priceless. UnPhogettable is always worth the drive to Mesa.
5	Hands down my favorite coffee shop in town. They used to be located inside the Conspire art collective but have now moved into the old Hood Rides digs up the block and its awesome. Plenty of seating room at the bar and also a really cool little room next door  where you can pull up a seat and hang out. From what I understand there will be seating outside too. Most importantly however is the coffee. They use a special mix roasted specially by Cartel. Ill be the first to admit Im no coffee connoisseur but I do know this, every drink Ive had, no matter whos behind the bar has been perfect. Not burnt, not too sweet, and not a hint of pretentiousness. Sooooo, why go to S-word Bucks when you can get a better cup of coffee up the street. Oh and for those of us who burn the midnight oil on more than a few occasions, theyre open until 12am EVERY night.
4	While I am not usually a fan of corporate restaurants and brewpubs, BJs in Chandler is an exception to the rule. The beer is fresh as it is brewed on site and they usually have a couple of offerings that set them apart from the main street amber ale brewpub crowd. The best deal is the all you can eat soup and salad at lunch for around $8.00. Food is above average pub food and the pizzas are a ok. They also make root beer for the kids.
5	Hnnngffff their signature spinach pizza Its the only thing Ive ever ordered there And it alone warrants 5 stars.
5	Im married to a Japanese and work for Japanese company. Ive been to Japan I dont know how many times and have eaten well there. This is simply top class, Id even say special. The style is a kind of fusion ranging from basically pure Japanese to Japanese with some very tasteful western inflections. Im not in Phoenix often. But this will be on my list every time I go if I have anything to say about it.
4	Almost as good as the original Boomers.  Wasnt quite there for me but maybe because I was there on a Sunday and the help clearly wasnt into working that day.  Cant say I blame them though. Anyways, same good menu selections, good prices.  Sliders were tasty but not as good as at the original Boomers.     Needless to say, Ill be back and try them again.  These guys have awesome Chicago dogs and it would be a shame not to try them here!
3	While Scottsdales Jackrabbit Supper Club is Britney Spears-approved -- the pop singer made the rounds last December when she reportedly made out with Arizona Cardinals hottie Matt Leinart -- its a little too clubby for my taste. The music is usually loud, making it hard to carry on a conversation and nearly everyone looks like they stepped out of the pages of a fashion magazine. Oh, and be prepared to throw down more than the norm for drinks -- martinis are $13! If all of this isnt scaring you away, youll probably have a good time. And the best part? The bar offers hourly burlesque-style performances from the clubs saucy dancers.
4	Clean, clean, clean! Everything about this place was spotless. The food itself was perfectly adapted to suburban American tastes. Somehow even the Sweet & Sour chicken seemed.. extra clean. ::)
1	I dont expect much when grabbing lunch at a mall, but I expect better than this.  The seaweed salad was a generic overly soy tasting disappointment, the rainbow roll was barely worth eating - the shrimp on the roll tasted fishy, the fish was mealy-textured, and the rich was soft and too sticky.  The yellow tail roll suffered from the same, and we luckily were cautious enough not to try sashimi.  The miso soup was served barely like warm.  The tea was served barely luke warm. That was when we finally got service, which took a veritable eternity.  Tea refills?  Good luck on getting someones attention for that. The inside is a dismal, cavernous sport-bar/pool hall sort of feel.  Basically no redeeming features here.
1	I used to always go here for tires until my mechanic noticed my tires were the incorrect size.  Back to Discount I go to correct the problem, and they blamed me. I was told that I must have chosen the smaller tires to save 20 bucks a tire.  I ended up having to spend a lot of money on five new tires (my spare is a full size as well) three weeks before Christmas. I wrote the company a letter to tell them how wrong I felt the entire experience was, and I never heard anything back.  I will not be going here for future tire needs.
4	the folks at national car rental were very accommodating and even helped me upgrade my rental at little cost to me.  if the deal was right, i would definitely use this company again when visiting Phoenix!
5	What a great find! Located off of Yelp after a business meeting in the area & we were hungry before we hit the road. Very comfortable space, lighting is good so you can see each other & your food which is not always the case. The decor is not overwhelming but extremely comfortable, some TVs, Thai decor & more pop music on the overhead. The staff was extremely attentive from the moment we walked in through out the meal. My Jasmin iced tea never got to the bottom. The menu has great variety. The pad Thai was excellent as were the vegetarian rolls. The Tom Ka soup was excellent. Every member of our group got something different and they were all extremely happy. We will be back. Pricing was very reasonable. There is patio seating available. Check it out.
5	As I passed the velvet rope flanked by shiny, exotic cars I knew I was in for an experience.  Some might call it a fine-dining experience, but clearly this was something more.  A tribute to opulence and Regan-era excess, Dominicks is your seven-figure foodie fantasy come alive; from the moment you enter the swanky foyer to the gleaming 10 inch tower of tiramisu that finishes your meal.  Its glittery, bedazzled, and oozing pretension - and I loved it. The Service My visit to Dominicks was the night after its official opening.  The service tried very hard to be as impeccable as the surroundings and, while not perfect, the charming staff and the sincere effort put forth made little things like missing napkins and bread plates instantly forgivable.  Our server, Drew, let us know that the wait staff only had 2 - 3 tables each and it was very evident in the personal service we received.  A few more weeks of experience for the staff should easily iron out the little wrinkles. The Food We started with the jumbo shrimp appetizer, which unfortunately came with 3 shrimp - hardly conducive to sharing - so we ordered two. And "Jumbo" they certainly were, accompanied by a kicky cocktail sauce which my dinner companion felt was spicy enough.  Ever the daredevil, I added additional horseradish to mine because who doesnt like to burn the inside of their nostrils at dinner. For the main course we both had the 9-oz filet, lobster gnocchi and steamed asparagus.  My filet was a perfect rare-plus with a dark pink center, expertly seared and juicy. Surprisingly the lobster gnocchi really stole the show for me.  Im not big on starches or cream sauces so when it was suggested I wasnt particularly excited; I should have been.  The dough was light and fluffy, the cream sauce not too rich and the lobster added the perfect amount of salt & texture. After dinner I indulged in a grand marnier while my companion ordered the tiramisu.  He was presented with a 10 inch tall hunk of cake that could easily have been intended for 4 people.  The tiramisu was spongy and light, with a lovely cool custard and only a subtle flavor of rum.  A nice finish to an excellent meal.   Atmosphere We were lucky enough to score a poolside table which started off as very romantic but over the course of the evening became quite the place for people watching.  The scene at the small bar area on the 2nd floor was bustling and both the waiters and I wondered aloud how long it would be before a guest fell in the pool.  I bet they didnt make it through the weekend without someone making a splash.
5	I really like this Urgent Care!  Dont let their youthful looks fool you! John Altic PA-C and Dr. Brenden McRae are wonderful and very caring! In addition to having Urgent Care they are now opening a Private Family Practice -I cant wait for them to be my primary care physicians as well.  Great job gentlemen and staff!
4	Well i seen some 1 and 2 stars, dont know what the hell they talking about, but this place rocks. I gave them a 4 star cuz too many people take their kids and cant control them there. LOL.  But the food is the SHIZZNIT!!!!  The Chips they bring out are nice crunchy and salt to taste. the salsas and the Lil bean dip uffffff, love it.  The food is nice and spicy, since Im Mexican i can handle the heat.  I always get the Pollo con Queso, can you say DELISIOSO!!!  My favorite.  Waiter/es all are kind and helping on ordering.  If your into Mexican food, its a need to try.
2	I have to admit that I cant stop going to Carlys even though I KNOW I shouldnt!   Good:  I cant get enough of the Cape Cod salad! It is really somethin special, that aint no lie.  Also the soup is always flavorful. Bad: Has nothing to do with the food. It is all about the atmosphere, which is oppressive in an Im-so-unique-and-talented-and-you-are-smelly-dung sort of way. Staff is pretentious and lazy. They think they must be pretty lofty individuals for working there but that doesnt mean they LIKE to work, for gods sake....  The owner. She is somewhat friendly, but beware. She is the person who created this environment, and it becomes easy to believe once she starts bragging about how well-off she is.  So congratulations everyone! We support these immature little weasels who scorn this gross human ritual we indulge ourselves in: being a customer, AND apparently we have made the owner a rich woman but shhhhhh! Shes still the kewlest of the kewl. UPDATE: Received an annoying email from the owner (the husband) who instructed me give " *constructive criticism* " and not make a personal attack or be petty. My review was neither of those things. I do not know John, nor do I know Carla. I only know what I experience when I have lunch at their place of business. The staff was rude and lazy. The owner DID brag. The food I always order is good. Get a grip buddy. I was honest about my experience for OTHER PEOPLE who are considering spending their cash on food there.  I am not in the least concerned about the owners or the staff personally, but apparently John thinks I ought to be.  I ought to see how great Carla is. In fact, he goes into detail about how great Carla is.  Its nice to witness a man standing up for his lady. It would almost cause me to add a star up there, but sorry, no can do.  His improper use of the possessive apostrophe SEVERAL times canceled that out (okay, now that was petty -my bad).   Id advise John to concentrate on things other than trolling around yelp, chastising his own customers, whose business supports that fancy paint and the famously zombie-like staff.  Maybe the staff is just following Johns lead when they dont focus on creating a positive experience for their customers? Honestly, I remain puzzled as to why John would bother to bother me.  I go into a small restaurant to find the owner bragging. That is part of my experience and I will continue to post reviews featuring owners, and how they carry themselves. As for the "personal attack" on Carla, I will not retract what I said just because John is butthurt and whines about it. I will say this: Carla has probably been in the restaurant several of the many times I have dined there, but I perceived the bragging only one time. I doubt anyone who read my review would label this person a braggart based on that one experience of mine, and as I said before- it did not and would not stop me from going back. I will be back. I will order the food and enjoy the food, but since thats not the only part of the dining experience, I will tolerate the negative things because the food I regularly order is consistently good.
4	Great place for shows. Excellent place for everyone.
4	This is obviously the mecca of the Phoenician mountain hikes, and deservedly so. Camelback is the perfect mix of central location, unparalleled views and, most importantly, a grueling workout. I love hiking this mountain because of the mix of rock types. It starts out as red rock near the base up to the hella scary rails, then very suddenly changes to a granite look-alike (Anyone know if thats actually granite about halfway up? It sure looks like it.) The last leg is bascially boulders that you have to crawl over, but the view at the top is an unbeatable 360-degree view of the Valley. Though South Mountain has a more centralized view, on Camelback you really feel on top of the whole Valley. My only complaints: First, the parking is a nightmare, especially on the weekends. Perhaps its just due to its reputation (and the surplus of multimillion-dollar homes in the area), but it can be hard to find a spot. Plus, people like to jockey for position on those rails, especially coming down, so be careful you dont take a tumble.
3	Really mixed feelings here. Met a friend here on a Thursday about 6:45. Place was busy, but we were able to get seated immediately as it wasnt totally full, and even being not at capacity, it was insanely loud. Naturally I expect a beer bar to have a relatively high volume but this place was ridiculously loud to the point of being annoying. The beer selection was good though Im not sure that makes up for the loudness and atmosphere that seemed a bit off: really brightly lit, and the decorating was of the signs-bought-new-but-made-to-look-old variety. Almost like a Bennigans, kind of fakey-like. And why oh why does a place that specializes in beer and seats so many people have just a single urinal and single stall in the tiny mens bathroom? I hate standing in line to pee but than again maybe Im just getting old :D (as an aside, obviously I have no experience using the womens so cant address that, sorry ladies) Ill try it again though. Food was OK, not great. Probably wont be a regular hangout since its not close by to where I live and it didnt seem worth going out of the way for considering how many other beer bars/breweries there are around the city with better atmosphere.
4	Big craft beer selection, in bottles and on tap. Not for those who go to a bar looking for mixed drinks (dont think they even sell liquor) or people who want to drink bud light. Youre likely to find something you like, even if youre a picky beer drinker, you just might have a hard time narrowing down from the huge selection. The coolest thing about his place is the liquor store style fridges, filled with individually and six pack priced beers. You can just walk up to the fridges, pull out what you want and either drink it there or take it home. Definitely a unique place. They also sell food, which we didnt have, but was available. Next to food poses outside, and other bars and clubs.
4	Update: they added a gorgeous new countertop (sans coffee wobbling mosiacs) and (ta-da!) a glass enclosed bakery display case! My friend Jefferson can now order his pastries with confidence.
5	Best in south chandler.  Glad they are out here
2	Bland and lackluster food that is not worth the price or the wait to get it.  We had lunch at Nourish a few months ago and while we werent overly impressed, as they do serve healthy food that is in line with our whole foods, plant-based eating habits, we decided to give them another shot and went for brunch a few weekends ago.  I ordered the egg sandwich, which is described as an air-fried egg, avocado, and tomato on a gluten free bagel with a side of sweet potato hash.  As I have never found gluten free bread products to be very mouth-watering, I asked to substitute multi-grain bread in place of the bagel, as the bread had previously been the best part of the lunch sandwich that Id had.  The server informed me that they were out of bread (how does a restaurant run out of bread when half of their menu items are sandwiches? very poor planning by management) and that the only other item available was a wheat bun, which I opted for.  My husband ordered the veggie quiche, which is described as zucchini, asparagus, caramelized onion, parmesan, and a quinoa crust.  After an incredibly long wait (the restaurant was less than 1/3 full), our food finally arrived.  My egg sandwich was by far the most flavorless breakfast item I have ever consumed.  The air-fried egg had sounded appealing as it would be healthy and not greasy, which was the case, however I didnt realize that this also meant there would be absolutely no seasoning on it or flavor to it at all.  The sweet potato hash was downright disgusting and I only consumed a cube or two of the mushy, flavorless heap that was on my plate.  As bad as my meal was, my husbands veggie quiche definitely won the award for worst breakfast item ever tasted.  The "quinoa crust" which we were looking forward to as we love quinoa dishes, was actually undercooked quinoa mixed throughout the entire quiche with no visible crust present, which gave the whole thing a granular texture equivalent to fine gravel having been poured into the dish.  The vegetables almost appeared to be ground up as there was just an overall green appearance to the egg portion with no discernible pieces of the veggies described on the menu actually present.  The dish in general had a strange taste and the off-putting texture from the quinoa was more than I could handle even in just the one bite that I tasted.  I honestly dont know how my husband even managed to choke down the portion of the quiche that he did. We also each had two bloody marys while we were there and while each took an incredibly long time to get, the first one was flavorful and seemed to be made "extra spicy" as we requested, however, the second one was flavorless and tasted like watered down tomato juice.  While Nourish has a nice patio and offers a view of the lush foliage present in the complex, these elements are not enough to bring us back after we left with our tastebuds reeling in horror over the flavors, or lack thereof, of our brunch.
3	We really wanted to like Honey Bears. As far as BBQ goes, this was a perfectly average meal. My side salad was ok, corn was very good, pulled chicken was very dry and the roll it was on (got sliders) was store bought. No amount of sauce made the chicken juicier. Unfortunately the sauce had no character-was just sauce. While we are on that, flies were all around the sauce. My husbands ribs were ok but not very meaty. We are hitting all the BBQ joints in the area as we just moved here. We wont be going back here unfortunately.
4	I really liked the experience I had at Marcellinos on Friday night.  They had opera singers from the Phoenix Symphony performing which were very good.  I enjoyed my handmade ravioli with spinach and yummy cheese (not fish yay!) filling and the wine and the mouse.  It was good!!  But then something happened....my date gave the server his card to pay for the meal and it was brought back as not able to be processed (yikes!).  The server also informed him that theyd been able to process someone elses but one other didnt go through.  My date checked his account on line and it had plenty to cover, but had just enough cash to cover the tab, not really enough for a tip.  So he asked the server if they would try to put a lesser amount on the card to cover the tip and take the cash.  This is when the server informed us that the machine might be down and it wasnt just his it was everyones! So he kinda lied earlier, which wasnt cool.  We then waited another 30 minutes without an appearance by the server to explain what was going on, although I could see Marcellino working on the machine, even trying his own card.  My date got up to go speak with him, and the server tried to divert him, but he was respectful and wanted to speak with the owner.  No attempt was made to really apologize for the delay or make up for the wait...so they wrote down his information and address to mail him a receipt. Then, the next day, he checked his account and hed been charged twice!! :( sad, because I thought I might like to go back at some point.
4	My girlfriend and I were hungry and wanted to try something new, so we hopped on the netbook and fired up Yelp. We tried Crazy Jims, and boy was this a good pick. When we 1st rolled up to CJs my girl was like "I dont know about this!!!" I said "lets just go in and take a look, if it is clean inside then lets try it". Once inside the place was small but quaint and most important it was CLEAN. So I ordered a veggie pita and got the pasta salad as a side. The food was ready pretty fast and I had envisioned something like a sandwich that you pickup and eat but it was all laid out over my plate. The pita was very good and I give a big thumbs up to, the pasta salad was kinda plain. My girl has a greek salad and she liked it but wasnt too crazy about the dressing. I would definitely go back to Crazy Jims and eat. As a matter of fact anytime I am craving that veggie pita, your boy "E" will come to visit.  ps. Our server was great also, friendly, fast and helpful.
3	This place is too loud.  It would have been nice to have a meal without some lady yelling meatlog across the room.  Also the waitstaff was somewhat incompetent and snobby.  The food was delicious but its not something anyone can make themselves at home.  They are stingy with their bread even though it is now free. Lots of annoying things that will probably persuade me not to come back.
4	Amazing food! Great waiting staff, and the drink I ordered was very good and had the right amount of liquor. I will be coming back to this place for sure!
3	The Nee House.......well I just wish they would get the concept of customer service! I tend to feel second rate when we go in for dinner.  I really like the food but after 5 attempts at dining in with crappy service we have decided it is best for take out only.  The food is pretty good and they are super quick when it come to take out. I am happy to say that when I picked up our order yesterday the girl at the front actually smiled and chatted with me while processing our order!
5	Best food, super friendly staff, and great prices. Love it!
5	Steve is one of the few shops that can still do a decent flat top.  He is in my neighborhood, so it is great for me - convenient.   Steve is personable and the shop is inviting.  I love the hot towel and back-vibrator massage.  I have been going to Steve for years, great service product!
4	Love this place pretty decent sushi for a good price, I love that they have happy hour and reverse happy hour. Theyre even open till 2am for when Im craving sushi for a midnight meal:) Only reason I gave it 4stars is that the service is slow sometimes
4	This is the best mall in Arizona.  Lots of high end shops and nice restaurants.  Except during the holidays, plenty of covered parking.
4	Went back to AB a few weekends ago, again for brunch, with a large group.  I was surprised to see that, although they advertise themselves as being a brunch place on the weekends, they have pared their menu down to basically 4 items.  The people that I invited that had never been to AB before were expecting more of a variety in brunch items since Id told them that they had great brunch, but their concerns were quelled with a few bloody Marys and some good (if not diverse) food.  I had the egg sandwich sans bacon again (excellent again) and Sweet Pea and I split the french toast as well.  Wed only had a small sample of the french toast at the opening, so we didnt realize that it comes with this whole jar of cream and berries, in addition to the syrup.  If you come here for brunch and like french toast, you have to try it.  Its the best french toast Ive ever had, and many at our table agreed.  The secret is that they bread it in cornflakes.  Yum.  And, the bloody Marys are in the excellent range, Id say just below the phenomenal ones at Dicks/Rokerij.  The service was also friendly and quick.
4	Monday and Tuesday night after 8pm, you can get any bottle of wine and a whole board of bruschetta for $20. Its a steal, and a delicious one at that.
4	Golden Panda has a special place in my heart; the part I clog with orange chicken. Im sure its not the most authentic Chinese meal, although i dont know, but i consider it the best Chinese take out in the area, solely based on this one item.  Although I get the same thing every time i have on occasion tried other items that people with me have ordered. All the chicken entries are good, the same lightly fried chicken just different sauces (general tso is my 2nd favorite). The beef dishes are terrible. The seafood is just ok. The won ton soup is really good as well and is usually the second thing i will order if orange chicken isnt enough. I cant remember if the pork is any good but the won ton soup has pork in it so i would give it a shot if you like pork far more than chicken.  The owners and servers are a bit jaded by the high school students that frequent the place during lunch but will warm up quickly if you go in there a few times. Food comes fast by the way so make sure that when you get take out that you let them know if you will take more than 5 minutes otherwise it will be done and waiting for you after 5 minutes.  The store has few tables where you can eat but for the most part is a takeout/delivery based establishment. However if you do eat there they have Barqs red cream soda on their fountain.
5	Fantastic donuts! Great selection! Coffee was definitely above average!
4	I visit this Subway several times a week. Staff are very friendly. Good customer service. Ingredients seem pretty consistently fresh. Its a standard Subway but differentiated by friendly staff and good service.
3	I had seen these around before but never stopped in. Started with a drink menu and was quite happy. Good selection of Margaritas and others. The dinner menu was good as well. Drinks were excellent and food was tasty. Ill make a return trip if for nothing more than a drink. A-OK.
4	This is a cool spot.  It does live up to its name in that the restaurant has a posh, bistro like ambience to it.  You can get burgers like a la carte by getting them in 3oz, 6oz, or 9oz sizes, so its possible to mix and match to try different burgers.  I had the Wagyu (kobe beef) and the Lamb, and they were pretty average.  Meat wasnt extremely tender or anything and the bun was so-so.  Sweet potato fries and onion rings were really good though.  They have several four peaks and Grand Canyon pilsner on tap.  I think overall the food is par to a cut above par, but I dont think I go there for the food - its definitely a fun experience everytime you eat at Stax and the varieties of burgers are what makes it.  Check it out!
5	Love this spot - its pretty close to the convention center so Natalie and I went here to check it out. The bacon is awesome here! Their philosophy is great too - local, organic, etc. etc.  The place is tiny and quaint too and as always its great to support a local independent business.   Best breakfast in Phoenix that ive had and definitely one of my fave spots - went there the next day too - got the special and it was delish - check my photos to see what we got!
4	Just visited this morning and had a great experience. The staff was friendly, and the coffee was great. I had a raspberry muffin and iced toddy. Muffin was large and full of flavor. The owner was kind enough to give me a sample of the toddy (iced coffee brewed for 24 hrs i believe) My husband got the quiche which was light and fluffy and Ill order next time for sure. I loved the vintage plates they give you, and the atmosphere is inviting and airy.  It is kind of a cramped space when busy, but worth any wait and maneuvering.
4	Skip the reviews that reference anything about bad service.  Da Beau and I ate lunch, here, today and we had a very pleasant experience.  Yep, a solid four-stars.     It was our first visit.  I was familiar with Mia Francesca ("MF") as a friend of mine, who lives in Chicago, has, since God invented dirt, rated her local MF as an out-n-out favorite.  And her word is the ever lovin gospel when it comes to food.  I mean, I dont even collect $200 -- I just go.  KnowhatImsayin? Onward, with the review! Kyle was our server (and he might be the bartender, too) was very friendly, informative and attentive.  Then we find out hes a fellow Texas boy...which classifies his attributes as hardwired.  Whats more, he treats his job like it was his own business; e.g., at the end of the meal he gave us a business card and added he would enjoy serving us the next time.  And there will be a next time and a next time and a next time.   Semi-quick facts, anyone?  (Its rare a Texan has a short story.).   -- Good, warm bread; accompanying olive oil was herbaceous and handily decanted from a table-set bottle -- Da Beau ordered a starter of (peeled!) asparagus with tomatoes and gorgonzola that was lightly dressed with a tangy vinaigrette.  The leftover tomatoes and zola were a treat atop the warm, oil-dipped bread -- We both ordered -- and consumed to the point of making a happy plate -- the barrumunda atop lentils and sauteed spinach.  This was our first tasting of barrumunda.  A moderately white fish, it is native to the rivers of Australia and reminded me of good ol Texas catfish.  (Note to self:  fry-up a batch of panko-crusted barrumunda at home.).  The three fillets of fish, lentils and spinach were perfectly seasoned (read:  a smidgen of salt).   Again, pay no attention to the reviews, here, about bad service.  Yet, lets say those reviews make an impression.  Ok, if you have any reservations about dining here, go anyway and ask to be seated in Kyles station.
2	What the crap folks? So much "blah blah blah" "this place is so great" spewing from Yelpers and the media that I felt like I was missing out.  I finally went to this damn place and I guess I am missing the point because this was a joke. Their menu has all of about 5 things on it.  Most of them seem reasonably priced until you see their size.  I ordered the Vampiro because it sounded good, had guac, carne asada, and was portrayed as a quesadilla type meal.  Ya, this thing was like the size of a Kennedy half dollar - and half as filling!  What the hell? $4 for this?  I cant even taste the guac!! If I want cheap good mexican food, I guess Ill stick with Bertos because this place is a disaster.  At least at Bertos I can get more than 5 items and the burritos are Soviet-car-sized.
5	We make it a tradition to come here whenever family is in town. So Ive probably been here atleast 10 times. Love their steak with buttered plates. Weve had it before where the streak wasnt cooked to our satisfaction. But after being there so many times I know how to order it. Sweet potato casserole is excellent. Cesar salad is the best Ive ever had. On this occasion the wait staff was very friendly, but Ive had it before where they are like buzzing bees. I usually like to have tea after dinner which is always nice.  The atmosphere is good. It is nicer to sit in the main dining area near the windows instead of the side room. Also people if you are going to spend hundred dollars on dinner, dont cheap out on a babysitter. Nobody wants to listen to your whinnying little brat kids who cant sit still. Ruth Chris should have an age requirement! Ive been to Mortons twice. Once in Chicago and once in Phoenix and both times it wasnt as good as Ruth Chris.
3	Meh. Plus for cool decor. Minus for being in a strip mall (but hey its Phoenix...) Cinnamon Roll was good.  Awesome icing. Toluca Brizza was unique, but nothing spectacular. it would be a good place for groups, with a vast menu (that i hear is very vegan friendly), but they are better places around town for brunch, both in terms of quality and price points.
3	This place is the least douche-filled club of the douche tour in downtown Scottsdale. It is a huge club and in some ways its like an anchor store in a mall - like Dillards or JC Penny. You can get a little bit of everything you want in one place... Its got its share of plastics and douchebags, but also has a number of college kids venturing away from Tempe to go dancing.  The place itself is kinda cool with various rooms of different themes and a good sized dance floor. The VIP area upstairs is pretty neat if you can swing the fee. They have the requisite go-go dancers with giant boots on some nights and they often feature good local dj talent. I havent had to wait in line to go here in years because Im always invited to go - I reckon if I had to wait in line, Id just not go. Dont buy a girl a drink - apparently, this place attracts some pretty (when its dark) homeless alcoholics. These girls need jobs (and not boob jobs - thats already been covered).  Myst is large enought that you can go here and manage to find a good time... drinks are a bit pricey, but thats par for the course in the area. Its a one-stop-shop for all your drinking and dancing and scamming needs. Youre also very close to a slew of other smaller clubs of the same sort if Myst isnt happening. One of the best parts is that its across the way from a pizza by the slice place that stays open after hours just to feed the drunk idiots so they can "sober up" for the drive home. Sometimes I go here around 2am sober just to people watch... on any given night, youre likely to see either a fight break out, some drunk chick puke on her hair, or someone crying over something stupid. You also get to see everyone in the harsh fluorescent lights not looking their best - the shine and polish is gone from their outfit and the product in their hair has quit on them and the girls makeup has given up long ago - plus, they are too drunk to suck in that gut or push out that chest. Its very amusing. Yes - Myst is a good place to go if you want to go clubbing in Scottsdale - send your out-of-town friends here... locals who arent into the scene will loath it. I pretty much do.
5	House special chicken is a must. This is not a fancy schmancy place so you know the food will be good! Never have had to wait for a table. The banana thingies they give you for dessert are awesome too. I give it 5 stars because of the huge selection. Pei Wei and PF Changs are ok but they have a limited menu. And a LARGE wait!
3	Jack in the Box, this one in particular, is busiest from 10pm-2am. It definitely a "better when your drunk" kind of place, or at least I think it is from the number of drunk patrons I see eating there.  The food? Well, its JitB, what do you expect? You got the 99 cent for 2 tacos deal, which is a must add for any meal. You also have breakfast served all day. This means you can get a Extreme Sausage Sandwhich, 2 Tacos, and a Chicken Fajita Pita in the same meal. Thats some good eatin. Please note that nothing about the Chicken Fajita Pita is remotely close to an actual fajita.  This location specializes in making your food NOT look like it does in the picture. The picture may show a big fluffy bun with a juicy burger, however your burger will probably look like someone stepped on it then ran it over with their car. It doesnt change the taste, tho. Still tastes exactly like you would expect something to taste from JitB. I mean, its good food and a good value. By "good" food, I of course mean greasy and unhealthy. That is the definition of good food though, right?
3	Havent been to a Chilis in FOREVER but those darn gift cards get me every time. Stopped by today for dinner and we ordered the 2 for 20 special (an app and 2 entrees).  The food was alright-we ordered the Spicy Chicken Fajitas, the Bacon Chicken Quesadilla and started off with the Onion and Jalapeno Stack. The jalapenos were lame but everything else tasted great after a long day at work. What was not so great was the service. Two waiters introduced themselves (I figured one was training) but neither bothered to stop by and fill up our drinks or really check in. The girl who served us seemed to spend most of her time on the other side of the dining room and the teen host actually ended up being the one to refill my Strawberry Lemonade. So thanks to the young dude manning the desk and NOT my slow waiterS.
2	5 star view... everything else is average... bar is small, food is ok, drinks are blah
4	Came here for dinner and dim sum. Dinner probably deserves 5 stars but dim sum was probably 3 stars, so Ill just average my experience to 4 stars.  Food:  Dinner: Theres these dishes that are on sale right now for less than $10 and most of them are clay pot dishes (which are DELICIOUS!). All the dinner items we ordered were AMAZING! Especially the green beans! Those were flavored and stir fried to perfection! Ive had this dish many times at many different places and this was by far the BEST green bean dish Ive ever had! The clay pots were ALL amazing! Everything tasted SOOO GOOD!  Dim sum: Not enough dim sum items and the ones that did show up were only ok. We were sitting around for a really long time and nothing would come. When the ladies did come by with the carts, they would not even try to sell us anything. We had to be all proactive and ask everyone whats in the carts. Even when we did that, the ladies would just say "nothing new" and push the cart away. We had to order things from the kitchen but even those things would take forever to come. A few of the dim sum dishes we ordered came AFTER we asked for our check and paid already.  Service:  Dinner: Great service! No complaints there! Dim sum: REALLY SLOW...why was there no food???  Ambiance:  This restaurant is in the middle of a food court of a shopping plaza. They just put up dividers to section off the "restaurant" from the rest of the food court. I was hesitant to eat at this place, but Im glad I did because dinner was amazing! Dim sum...thats a different story. If you get over the fact that you are really sitting in the middle of a food court, then its not so bad.  Price:  Both dinner and dim sum items were pretty cheap.  Overall:  I really liked eating dinner here! All the dishes were delicious! Dim sum probably would have been better if there was more food and the dim sum ladies were better about showing us what was available. I would totally come again for dinner but maybe not dim sum.
5	I joined a friend for a two hour evening ride at CCO. We were the only two riders, may be because it was a Sunday eve and all the tourists were drinking their mimosas by their hotel pools. The horses looked very well taken care of. Mine was 17 year old Sundance, a beautiful brown male. Ive never ridden before, and he was easy to control. Our guide Ed was patient, funny and awesome company. He showed me the basics and was always there with a word of encouragement and a tip or two. Tip for the guys, if you plan to trot, wear tight jeans, you will be thankful at the end of the day. The city slicker that I am, I left my phone in my shirt pocket, ended up dropping it while on the ride and Ed helped us go look for it. The desert, sun set over the mountains and the sandstorm about 30 miles away all made this a very memorable evening. I highly recommend CCO.
5	This place is the best! They stopped doing tacos, but if your lucky! they do have them call before you go! Some outside seating (picnic tables) no seating inside. Take away only.They also have another location!!! Yea! In a strip mall on 51 ave & orangewood. They do serve "tacos" at this location!
4	This is a great dog park to have in the area.  It has a ton of room for the big dogs to run around and there are baggies and trash cans scattered all around it so you dont have to go far to pick up after your dog.  I also love that there are a couple water stations in case you dont bring your own water bowl.  The area for the small dogs looked to be a pretty decent size as well.  The only downside to this dog park is that the ground is pretty muddy so Id recommend wearing shoes you dont care about and bringing extra towels to clean up your pup after theyre done.
5	Rosie, Dakota, and I LOVE Chaparral Dog Park!!! Its very convenient and surrounded by a lot of paths, a desert xeriscape, baseball fields, ballparks, and a lake with ducks. The Scottsdale Park and Rec Dept. does a wonderful job of keeping the park clean and shaded.  You can find trash cans and poopy-pick up mitts located all over the park and paths. The fenced in area is huge to let the dogs run, play, and sniff!
4	The Vig Uptown has its hits and misses, but the hits definitely outnumber the misses. First of all, the building and atmosphere is awesome. I think it used to be a Bank of America? They really outdid themselves with the renovations and decor.  The drinks, while pricey, are really good. I had the basil-gin-strawberry drink and it was deeeelishhhh. My husband had a tasty IPA he has never had before.  Service was good. Our server seemed to have a zillion tables and still was attentive and pleasant.  When it comes to food, my husband and I had different experiences. He had the Vigazz burger which he thought was outstanding. It is now tied with 2 other burgers for his favorite burgers of all time.  Vegetarian entrees are limited to a couple salads and a veggie sandwich. I had the veggie sandwich which was decent but I wasnt impressed. Although the grilled veggies were tasty the sandwich was dry overall. The foccacia was a little too doughy. And the caramelized onions were more raw than caramelized. The french fries were good but the barbeque seasoning on them annoyed me slightly. I think next time I will ask if I can order a grilled cheese off the kids menu. With a side of their yummy spicy mayo. Talking about kids menu, that was another miss. Having a stepson myself, I appreciate hip establishments that are still kid friendly. However there was a very obnoxious group of kids and parents that looked like they just came from the kids soccer game. The kids dominated the bocce court and were loud, rude, and obnoxious. The parents were enjoying their cocktails and ignored their kids behavior. It kind of ruined the mood for us. I wish they would have just gone to Peter Piper like most kids teams do after a game... We do really want to return. Maybe for happy hour or brunch. I want to try their bloody marys and the Amber Scramble. We might even take our kid. But dont worry- he will be well supervised! :)
4	Creative menu, yummy and affordable vegetarian food! 4/5 J and I are not vegetarians but we were up for a new restaurant and adventure on Friday night. We met up with P and R (vegetarian) at Green around 8pm for dinner. The food was amazingly delicious and cheap! We all shared some non-meat chicken wings... it was so GOOD! our food came out tasty too. Js chicken sandwich was great with its yummy BBQ sauce... Would definitely go back again for other dishes.
5	I came here after receiving a free pizza at a Yelp event.  Upper Crust had some of the best food at the event so I couldnt wait to have dinner at the restaurant.   My friend and I came here on a Wednesday and were pleasantly surprised it was 1/2 off a bottle of wine day.  I cant remember exactly which wine we ordered, but it was a Shiraz and it was good.  We shared a happy hour appetizer of mild wings and a large pepperoni pizza with basil.  It was all so delicious!   I also came here a different day with my boyfriend and we shared the meatballs with cheese on top and a large pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and basil.  Again, it was very tasty!    Everyone was very friendly and prompt.  I will be back to Upper Crust!
1	Had to eat here with coworkers for lunch today and was incredibly disappointed. My $8 caesar salad was probably the tiniest Ive ever had. Service was slow, the entire table was nearly finished before mine arrived, and staff was unapologetic. Ive had side salads larger than the full salad they served me for lunch. Overall a miserable experience and I wont be back.
5	San Felipes Cantina will always have a special place in my heart. Ive been coming here since it opened, and I havent been disappointed yet! Heres some of my favorite things about them: Happy Hour - San Felipes has one of the best happy hours in the valley. Their drinks and appetizers are half off from 4pm-7pm, and my bill for drinks and dinner with friends is typically $20-$30. You cant beat that! Service - I usually sit up at the bar when I stop by, and they have some of the friendliest bartenders in town! They always make me feel at home when I stop by, and theyre quick to serve me during the late-night hours. The managers are also really good about hanging out and chatting with the customers to make them feel special. It works! Food and Drinks - My favorite drink at San Felipes is probably the Mexican Iced Tea. Its a long island iced tea, but they use passion fruit vodka instead of the traditional unflavored vodka. As far as food goes, I REALLY like the baja chicken wrap, the sonoran chicken sandwich, and the steak burrito with green sauce. A quick tip - ANYTHING with the baja sauce is great :) Overall, this place is a lot of fun, and I really like the laid back vibe. Ill definitely be back!
4	Tucked in a quite plaza In Chandler AZ, is an un-assuming, little Thai restaurant with BIG flavor. Despite the lack-luster curb appeal from the outside, the inside is quaint and clean.  Get things started with some spring rolls. The sauce isnt mind blowing, but those 6 dainty morsels of fried goodness have got some real flavors goin on. (especially when dipped in your curry) I recommend their signature dish, "Thai Basil," for those who havent been here before.  I prefer an extra spicy, KANG-DANG (red curry): Your choice of meat, simmered in coconut milk with bamboo shoots, bell pepper, broccoli, carrots, green beans and Thai basil, Served with jasmine rice.   I will say, some menu items are hit and miss. So dont judge this place based on ONE dish you dont like. (You can find something you arent going to like on every menu across the country).  Friendly service, fresh ingredients, and an authentic "je ne sais quoi," earn Thai Basil 4 stars. "Im a fan."  Eat well, Live well, and surround yourselves with ones who do.  - Cheers
3	I liked the tortillas:  handmade, rich and salty.  I thought the food was decent.  I thought service was okay.  I am not new to Mexican food, I know what I want:  when I say I want cheese and cilantro and tomatillo salsa,  please give it to me.  They charged me and extra dollar for had smattering of queso fresca.  Boo.  I liked the mango-pineapple aqua, super sweet and clean flavor.  I would go back, maybe.
4	This place is pretty darn good, if your into bbq. My husband ordered a burger with bacon, brisket and cheese, this was very tasty! I ordered the bbq chicken salad, room for improvement here. It was plenty big, but lacked in significant flavor. Mostly lettuce, a small amount of corn, almost nothing else to speak of.  The reason I gave it four stars is because of the burger and fries that were pretty awesome.  I guess its just not a place for salads.  The customer service was great as well. They were training a new girl, but she had a wonderful attitude.
5	The best tai in downtown for the price! Masiman is the most tasty dish here!
5	True Mexican street fare - at first a little intimidating for this Gringa, but it was awesome.   The owner Dan (who happens to be a Culinary Institute trained chef) put together a variety pack for us.  Everything is small and cheap, so you can get a whole bunch of different stuff to try.  $30 fed 5 people. On the NE corner of 19th Ave & Glendale, next to 7-11.  Give em a try - you wont be disappointed!
4	THIS PLACE IS GREAT IF YOU ARE TRAVELING WITH YOUR DOG! The double bed room was extremely clean and updated. Nice fluffy pillows and duvet covers. Bathrooms nice and new looking. The daily breakfast bar was wonderful and the sitting area clean and nice.  The one issue was the AC. Jeez it was a rattle bucket and kept us up at night. we would turn it off until we would wake up sweating and then turn it on for an hour, wake up and turn it off.....oh brother.  I would have liked a good night sleep, since everything else was nice.  Pets welcome and that was a bonus.
5	My favorite place in the world to eat! Great service and awesome food!
5	Great food and even better beer. Staff are always friendly.  My favorite microbrewery in the Valley.
1	The service level and attitude of the staff was diabolical, they demonstrated absolutely no interest in our business. Ever since moving to the new premises, things have sucked. I shall not be wasting any more of my time or money here.
4	Ive now been here twice, one to eat in and one to carry out. All in all, great prices, decent service, and semi-good food. Ive had the pho when I sat down and ate at the restaurant.  Not the best Ive had, but at the price, really good and fulfilling. When Ive carried out: had the bun thit nuon.  Great stuff. Mi xao and hu tieu xao were just ok. I like that the whole place is very big (from a recent expansion, Im reading).  The bathrooms are pretty good and the service is not too typical Viet: actually friendly-ish and not too rude/brusque. I would come back again for sure. The prices are what you would find in California, so that is just too good to pass up.
1	YUUKK!!! That pretty much describes this place.  We went there on Sunday afternoon for lunch.  Only 1 person in line in front of us.  I ordered the 2 meat combo, rib tips and hot links...sides of mac & cheese and potato salad.    ...it took about 40 mins to get my food.  But I told myself if it was good...then its worth the wait.  But by God it wasnt good at all.  The mac & cheese had no flavor at all...i mean none.  The potato salad was very flavorless as well.  The rib tips would have been good if they werent covered in 5 gallons of bbq sauce, nasty bbq sauce at that.  Their sauce is like a sweet and sour sauce...was not good at all.  The hot links were mixed in with the rib tips and covered in the same sauce.  So couldnt tell if they were any good, cause there was so much of that damn sauce. The funny part was that the couple that ordered right after me, got their food and took it right back to the counter and straight out said that the food was just disgusting.  I wish I would have done the same instead of spending $15+ on nasty bbq. In short.  I will not be going back here.
4	Went for the free "Movies in the Park Free Family Movie Series" last night and really enjoyed myself. The park has a giant inflatable movie screen where they show family movies every Friday night at 7 in the early spring months.  Get there early to get a spot closer to the screen and bring a picnic blanket to relax on. It got a little chilly later in the evening, I would bring a blanket to snuggle under too.
3	Eh, this place is okay.  I was not super impressed.  The food was okay.  I was not blown away.   After being seated, we sat at the table for a good 15 minutes without anyone noticing that no one had been to our table once.  We had to flag down a server.  Once we actually did have a server, the service was good.  I can forgive the glitch.  Everyone has a bad night.  But the food just lacked the wow factor.  Even though I have a twenty dollar gift certificate (to make up for the initial service issue) I have not been back.  I guess that about sums it up.
4	I forgot they built a bunch of FF places along Deer Valley Rd over the last several years, until my bro Daren C reminded me (shout out). Ive been making the rounds to various area Arbys using the shit out of the free BBQ Bacon Cheddar Roastburger (arbys.com/coupon and todays the last day!) I thought Id try out another store to avoid wearing out my welcome on Bell Rd., and Im glad I did. This is a clean, efficient operation.  The buildings pretty new, with a large dining area full of a variety of walled areas and nooks and crannies, giving many of the tables a private feel. Theres even a big atrium window, and a real, live 15 or so ficus tree growing indoors out of the floor in the dining area.  Great atmosphere for this kind of place. The service was quick and friendly.  I could tell that the young guy at the counter thought the manager barking orders was being a dick, but he took it in stride, smiling and saying "yes, sir" the whole time.  "richard" the manager was only doing what it takes to keep a FF store running smoothly, though, and young guy will someday get a job selling cars or something, and look back thankfully on all richard taught him about  upselling and add-ons, smiling and being friendly.  Bad on Arbys for getting rid of regular french fries, though, as they now only have curly or potato cakes (which are great, but i always appreciate variety). btw BBQ Bacon Cheddar Roastburger kicks butt.
2	I think the high reviews of Sofrita must simply be a function of the limited dining options in Fountain Hills as this is the worst excuse for tapas that Ive ever had.  We walked in and were greeted by a strange, musty smell that remained pervasive throughout the meal.  We should have taken that as an indication of what was to come and left, but based on the great reviews, decided to stay.  Big mistake. I ordered a red sangria which was okay, but had a strange flavor of figs or dates so Im not sure if it was just made with old wine that had turned and took on a prune juice flavor or if that taste was intentional.  We ordered the olives, fried potatoes, grilled zucchini, shisito peppers, and four different types of bruschetta.  The olives were, well, olives (tough to ruin those) but also contained some off-putting caperberries that we avoided.  The grilled zucchini was just plain zucchini with no seasoning whatsoever served with a side of what looked like potato salad as a dip, but we never really could identify what that substance was as it had absolutely no flavor so we opted to avoid the fat that it was obviously adding to the zucchini.  The shisito peppers had no spice or flavor at all and were absolutely swimming in oil.  Ive never had a "roasted" pepper that was so soaked in grease.  The waitress asked if we didnt like the peppers when she noticed that all but a few remained and when we pointed out how greasy they were, politely took them off the bill.  The four pieces of bruschetta were all of different varieties: roasted eggplant; ripe tomatoes; avocado and beans; and grilled artichoke with cheese.  The bread was thick and chewy and none of the bruschettas had much flavor at all.  In fact, I think if I had just closed my eyes and randomly selected one off the plate, I probably wouldnt have been able to tell which it was.  The fried potato wedges were actually the best part of the meal, which is sad when the best item is a simple fried potato. The atmosphere was severely lacking as there were candles on all of the tables and numerous votives on the walls, but not a single one was lit.  The restroom was extremely dark and was absolutely filled with unlit votive candles so Im not sure if this was an attempt at saving costs, but had I known this, I would have gladly spared a box of votives from home just to create some sort of ambiance while we ate.  The place is also incredibly tiny so I have no idea where the flamenco band and dancers that other reviews have spoken of would perform.  If anyone tried to move through there, they would literally be bumping into tables.   While I love tapas style dining, if this were the only tapas restaurant that there was, I would gladly forego the experience.  Needless to say, we wont be back.
4	Was in Phoenix for business and had to check out this starwood property. Ive stayed at Ws before so I wanted to compare. The goods: Starwood property! Close to airport Great price Cool room - very hip compared to most anything else youre going to stay in..  Not quite a W but not your typically Sheraton either.   Friendly staff Had this really cool video input box on the desk connected to the TV.  Allowed me to plug my laptop video into the box and have it come up on the TV.  Was able to stream netflix easily to the TV. They have a bar Easy parking close to the door Location drive-able to restaurants Pool  Quite The not so goods Bed and pillows kinda like a futon.   No formal restaurant.   Funky frozen dinner/entries offering is more funky than useful to me and I travel a lot. They do have a delivery menu from some local restaurants (A-Loft note:  Ruby Tuesdays food sucks) I would give it a 5 if it had a formal resturant.   Would I stay here again - yes for sure!
4	Perfect greasy food for the night after a bender, or a family breakfast. Im cool bringing my 10-month old here because its noisy and with so many other kids around she pretty much goes unnoticed, except by the nice waitresses.
4	Cartel is a coffee world unto itself for downtown Tempe, which is void of many non-alcoholic places to hang out.  Situated in what seems to be a motel from the outside and a garage on the inside, Cartel can satiate your brass tax coffee fix and your espresso lust for reasonable prices.   The coffee is great.  Period.  They roast the beans themselves, know way too much about coffee and are proud.  The espresso, in whatever form you get it in, is rich and nutty.  The toddy (cold brewed iced coffee) is strong to the point of me jittering out the door from a small one.  The teas are various and steeped in a cool manner and timed according to their type.  The vibe can come off a little pretentious sometimes with all their rules and such, but they are selling a great product and the rules help distinguish them from the crowd. I like to hangout here for an hour every week or so, good people watching, the pretentious guy behind the counter is good to listen to if you want to hear people getting so-so advice that they didnt ask for and my professors come here so it is a good place to catch them not in work mode. My only complaint is that they need to find a way to get a bike rack closer to the door.  My only other complaint is that they could have more snacks available, I would love to dip something baked in their coffee.
5	If you want to go back to the future at the movie theater Silver Cinemas is the place for you- I felt like I was in the 1980- the decor LITTERALLY says it all.. I kid you not, I am as frugle as the come and you get & more than you pay for here -($3.00 everyday except for tuesdays $1.50) have I mentioned the minnie arcade? Epic place to relive your childhood on date after drinks next door ...
3	Had breakfast here on a Saturday morning in July.  I ordered the Spanish Scramble.  It was good.  I dont have much to say.  Its close to home but its just okay.  Still looking for my go-to breakfast joint.
5	I first joined 24 hr fitness about a year ago, and I have had nothing but good experiences with the staff since the first day that I came in.  The people behind the front desk have always been very kind and attentive to my needs.  If I ever have a question or concern, it is always promptly answered or dealt with.  Some of them have even taken the time to learn my name and greet me as soon as I walk in the door! It is very impressive and makes for a very pleasant experience. :) On another note, I have been training with Trace for about 6 months now.  My goal was to lose a little bit of weight and tone up my body, and I could not be happier with the results! In 6 months I have lost 12 lbs. and I look and feel amazing! He is incredibly knowledgeable about training and nutrition, giving his clients hard workouts as well as meal plans.  Trace is the total package! **TIP: Try Traces boot camp on Wednesday evenings at 7:30.  They will kick your butt!!
3	Affordable and good.  Clean restaurant.  Will return.
5	Dropped into this joint just wandering around Old Town Scottsdale. Ordered the nachos and had a couple margs. WOW. The staff was friendly, have a great sense of humor (you gotta see the posted picture joke in person), and the food is...beyond good. Having only sampled the uber nacho plate, which is by the way, as big as a platter and slathered in layers of ooey gooey cheesy goodness, I can definitively say:  Best.  Ever.  I give this place the highest marks for "doesnt suck"
4	I went here the other day, as I had a Deal Chicken for this place. I used to go to a really good Salvadorian restaurant in Seattle, and was excited to see there was one right near where I live now. So the BF and I got here at around 8 at night on a Sunday and it was actually pretty busy. This place is in a tiny strip mall that does not look like it gets much business, and I would have never seen it from the road, so it must be good to still be in business. So I ordered a pollo pupusa, a carne asada pupusa, and a polla tamale, and the BF ordered two bean and cheese pupusas and a carne asada pupusa and we split the pastelitos con papas y queso. Well, the pastelitos were pretty tasty, like fried mashed potatoes, and they came with a spicier cabbage slaw which I liked a lot better than the regular cabbage slaw for the pupusas. All of the pupusas were really good, my real problem was with the sauce. The red sauce that came with them was just kind of flavorless. The place I used to go to had some really good red and green sauces for the pupusas... it was kind of disappointing. Also, about 5 minutes after we got the pupusas, the waitress came by and said oh I forgot to tell you we dont have any tamales. Well, that kind of sucks, why did it take til we were already in the middle of eating to tell us? Also, it screwed up the amount I was trying to spend (since I had 20$ to spend on the deal chicken) which I guess shows that this place is cheap, which is good, but for this particular trip that wasnt good. So we decided to order a dessert to replace the tamale. We got the empanadas de platano with sweet cream. So this was a big deal for the waitress, she had already totaled out the bill and for some reason it was a huge deal to add a dessert at the end (which I thought was weird, but felt guilty about giving her extra work). Anyway, the empanadas were ok, but Ive had better. The sweet cream is in the middle of the plantain and it isnt all that sweet. Oh well, I would definitely come back here for some yummy pupusas and maybe try a different dessert next time, the central american quesadilla looked pretty tasty....
4	Cmon, its deep dish Chicago-style pizza in Arizona. Im not about to complain. Forgo the appetizers, unless you can eat alot of food.  My friend and I came here after our 5K run. I packed away three mouth-watering slices of their signature pizza. It was so worth it. If I could have eaten more, I would have.  Forget thin crust or flat bread. Thick crust pales in comparison. Theres nothing else like deep dish, and Im glad theres an easily accessible joint in my hood that I can go to when I need my fix.
5	I love this place. My gf and I go every time we visit her parents in north scottsdale.  Pros quick and easy. good service. clean. good food. good management. not too expensive. they also post nutrition info on their menu (that alone is laudable).  cons, the salad dressing is quite sharp.
5	In 1999, I was discharged from the United States Marine Corps. Keeping a high and tight well maintained was a real pain in the ass because barbers dont understand what the hell its supposed to be like.  I am sure that many of you who keep this style of haircut understand. Any barber can sit you in a chair and cut your hair.  This guy used a razor to get skin close on the sides, and a leveler (no, I am not kidding) to make sure that the cut was even. I have gone to at least 20 barber shops in the Phoenix, Mesa, and Tempe area.  This barber shop beats them all. This is the BEST barber shop in Phoenix.  I have been a repeat customer for 9 years, and I will keep going back until they close up shop.
3	It seems like dine-in theaters are popping up all over the Valley these days. Studio Movie Grill in north Scottsdale recently opened. The theater has a far less luxurious feel than the AMC Esplanade 14 or even iPic Theaters. Instead of comfy reclining seats, youre stuck sitting upright, and you wont get any blankets to keep you warm. The inside looks the most like a traditional theater that Ive seen at a dine-in theater-and my companion mentioned the lobby reminded him of an airport, and the theater itself, a bowling alley. Like the other two places, though, ordering food or drinks from your server is as easy as pushing the button at your seat. Theyll come and grab your order (the menu is full of American food, similar to AMC Esplanade 14), and theyll deliver it to you throughout the movie. Movie tickets are $9 Sunday-Thursday and $11 Fridays and Saturdays, which is way less expensive than iPic and around the same price at Esplanade. I heard people are arriving up to an hour early for weekend movies, so be warned. We drank and ate during the movie. We got a pitcher of domestic beer for $15, which I thought was a good deal considering the two of us drank two beers each from it. For food, I ate a grilled cheese sandwich ($6.25), which came with French fries. I actually really liked this grilled cheese sandwich, since the bread was thick and there was lots of cheese, and the seasoned fries were thickly cut and tasted great. Some regular movie theater concession stand items at non-dine-in theaters are just as expensive, so I thought the food prices here were really reasonable. Though the food and prices were satisfactory, based on the less comfortable atmosphere, Id still pick AMC Esplanade 14 out of the now three dine-in theaters Ive tried.
2	The latest Consumer Report magazine gave this restuarant  a higher point value that Houstons.   We disagree.  They tried to be but couldnt even come close.  We were very disappointed in the lack of service, timing of food, and food. Hostesses were seen drinking from Gatorade bottles from there hostess stand,  Sara our server spent more time chatting with her tables that serving and taking care of her guest.  The manager on duty was checking his telephone and did not check our table.  My chicken was very dry.  Salad and soup were good.  Will not return.
4	I have been to this Museum twice so far. And both times I enjoyed myself. But this place is huge. There is so much to see if you are into Native American art or just art and lifestyles, history of Native Americans. I love it. I was recently there to see the Indian Market and seen the Boarding School exhibit and Kachina exhibit. I love seeing all the Kachina dolls. When ever I am in town I know I will always go there to check out the new exhibits.
5	Dinner for four at the soft opening. The food kept us talking about the tastes and combinations far into the night. Small/shared plates will fill you up quickly.  The Hamachi Crudo was a fresh, light starter with peppers, fennel and sea beans to fire up your appetite! Grilled asparagus and a delicate, cheesy risotto were great sides but the smoked beef rib was a taste sensation.  Sweet and savory, smoky and succulent, sticky and sumptuous! Bleu cheese grits and grilled peaches were the perfect pairing.  ahhhh, sigh.  I think Id pass up the tater tots and save room for something else.   This restaurant is just what Phoenix needs.  Close to the ball parks or walk off your dinner in an invigorated downtown, Blue Hound Kitchen is a great addition to the energy.
5	TIP #1 to Mesa-Gateway fliers: This is the ONLY bar at the airport, so live it-love it.  Food is great. The burgers can be made low-carb - especially great this gurl!  TIP #2: Food can be ordered to go...
1	4 stars for the place itself and its food/coffee. 0 stars for the service, or lack there of.  My business partner and I were in town for a convention.  We heard we should check out Lola.  So we did.  We were excited.  The lady (I use the term loosely here) who took our order was LESS than patient OR helpful.  We asked a few questions.  She barely answered us, then when we had to repeat the question she was nothing short of annoyed.  An example.  We asked where we could get a glass or cup of water.  She mumbled something about the bar/table.  My partner walked over and saw no cups.  She came back and asked where the cups were.  On the table came an exasperated retort.  I walked over to inspect for myself.  There were no cups on the table.  So I kindly asked her if the cups should be on the table, if so there appeared to be none.  She said they are on the table, but *sigh* Ill go check, but I know theyre there!  10 seconds later she comes out of the kitchen with a tube of cups.  IMAGINE THAT the customer was right.  I watched this lady serve other customers.  It appears that regulars are treated with a smile and courtesy and patience.  Newcomers or people she doesnt like are treated worse than the dirt on the bottom of her shoes. My suggestion to management, adjust her attitude or get rid of her!  She is not good for business.
5	These dentists are great at explaining medical issues in a way that you can understand. They are honest and very smart. They dont take my insurance and I still go there (lets face it, dental insurance doesnt reimburse much, so its only like a $15 difference for me to go out of network for a cleaning). I would never go anywhere else!
5	Good God, where has this been hiding? My bf and I just made our periodic trip to Phoenix and discovered this little gem. From his kids, no less.  We went during the 8pm-10pm Happy Hour...on a Friday night. We got a table in about 20 minutes for 6 of us. Our server was super friendly and took our drink order right away. The cosmos and appletinis were $4 and the sake bombs (with Kirin or Sapporo) were $5 and numerous rolls were $5 each; how do you beat that?  The food was spectacular. We ordered off of the regular menu (2 orders or tuna tataki, 2 orders of heart attacks, and a dragon roll) and the happy hour menu (crispy spicy tuna, philadelphia roll, calamari roll, shrimp tempura roll and a couple of others that I cant seem to remember). OMG, one slice of that tuna tataki and I was SOLD. This was some seriously great sushi...Bravo Yen Sushi!  Our bill for 6 peeps was $96, thats with the tip included, no less...YAY! I will definitely be back.
4	Great Pizza! Great food! Great service! Still, this place isnt perfect.... BE PREPARED TO WAIT! Alright, most people seem to know this going in (we did too). However, when you arrive at 7:00pm, and they say you wont be seated until 11:30pm, that doesnt mean you can put your name in and show up at 11...which we almost found out the hard way: **At 10:00pm they will do one last head count. If youre not in the vicinity, soooorrrrry!** Luckily we were calling in every hour for updates (which they recommend, btw). At 9:40pm we called and got the news that we better be there for the last head count (information we probably could have used earlier), and had to hurry on back from our meanderings downtown. At 10:00pm we were deemed worthy to stay on the list and wait another 45 minutes or so. Service: the hostess knows she holds all the cards--sort of like the lady at the cash register for the Soup Nazi. However, a smile was all it took to get one back from her for me. Still, I can see how others might misconstrue her attitude as something less than cordial. Our server was great though! Very helpful and fun. He was as excited to serve us as we were to eat there. Good stuff! The pizza is indeed great! But after waiting 4 hours, I was expecting the heavens to part and birds to sing and the ground to shake. Nope. Just made-from-scratch, meticulously-thought-out, high-quality pizza. A light and airy, smoky crust, a decent sauce and fresh mozzarella formed the basis of the Sonny Boy and Wise Guy pizzas that we tried. The quality and tastiness of the toppings were also apparent. We were impressed. This was absolutely great pizza--one of the best weve ever had. ...I just dont know if Ill hurry back to Pizzeria Bianco to wait that long again.
3	Went there with my date on Thursday night; it was quite empty. I dont think the decoration is as nice as it said in other reviews; its about alright. The issue I found is waiter walks pass in front of you during the movie. The color of the screen is yellowish that makes movie look old.  Its more like watching a DVD at home. When watching movies, I dont like to be interrupted, so the waiter service during the movie really bothers me.  The good thing is its very close to my house, I can go there on foot.
4	Great martinis and they even have Absynthe if youre looking to get crazy. Great looking modern style bar and lounge.
5	Im so in love with this place :) I tried the pepperoni pizza and I was AMAZED. i love that they have a fresh herb/vegetable garden in the front.  Its all about the FRESH ingredients these days.  I cant wait to go back and try different dishes. Id like to try the cheese platters :) mouth watering as we speak.  going again to day so Ill keep adding to this review. STAY TUNED! BTW, the decor reminds me of the VIG but definitely more spacious dining area.
4	Me and my sis were greeted with a pleasant smile and I like the whole $5 part with the coke and fries. I dont really enjoy drinking soda but Ill take it anyway especially if its fruity, they have all the old school pop in cans Shasta and RC I should learn to take more pics but this place is cramped inside and I may be claustrophobic. I had the portabello mushroom burger see pic it had rice and all this other stuff that just kinda fell out all over the place it was super messy but pretty tasty. The fries are soggy which ordinarily we wouldnt eat but they were really good we couldnt stop eating them. We sat on the back patio and got checked on by I am assuming was the owner she asked how we liked it, was way nice I love the friendliness of the place we left hekka full and happy! Next time we go we will probably just share an order of fries though.
4	Gotta get the hot wings! Theyll make sure you know what youre getting into, but even if you havent had them before, just play along. Theyre worth it.
3	My boyfriend and I tried this place out last Saturday. Our total was $24 for 2 burgers, 2 fries, 2 beverages. Not bad for a lunch in Scottsdale. We found the burgers to be just OK tasting. Nothin special to lure us back anytime soon. I was satisfied with portions for $. I think people are used to ridiculous huge meals like the ones served at cheesecake factory which are big enough to feed a family of horses so when they see a normal single portion they feel underwhelmed/cheated. I found the restaurant to be clean and nice enough to sit & enjoy the burger & kill some time before our movie started.
5	Love this place! Amazing Happy Hour Specials!!
5	If you are a tea drinker, you have to stop by! The variety seems endless as you read over the menu so it really comes down to which tea fits your particular mood at that moment (mine right now is the "cookie monster" which is awesome!)
4	I liked this place... because its a local owned place with delicious greasy food. This place was written up in the East Valley Trib in one of their "5 to try" pieces, which is where I first heard about it. But, I actually think its funnier that I have been in "Hall of Fame", a store located direclty next door several times and never given Giant Hamburgers a second glance.  You walk into this place, past a grouping of tables and booths (only about 15 tables in the entire place)  to the cash register where you order your meal. We each got a burger and fries and they were both great, a real gut-bomb, but sometimes youre in the mood for something that fits just that description. We sat and ate, and they came to bus our table for us.  On the way out, we noticed the "Yelp" sticker on the door. Bonus points.
4	Finally!  A Chinese restaurant on the west side thats really good!  Understand theyve been here a year - on a Saturday night at 6:30pm they were packed - at 7:15pm, they were practically empty.  Now you know when to arrive. Jo had Asparagas with Chicken and Shrimp, I had Kung Pao Beef...both excellent.  The spring rolls were very tasty. Id consider 5 stars except for the waiter - too much of a hurry, put down the spring rolls without sauce or mustard, never asked if we wanted anything.  I watched other waiters and they were much more thorough, so we just caught a poor one. Go back again?  For sure!
4	I dont come to AMC very often, even though it is the closest to my house, has great parking, good movies.  And there is only one reason....THE HARKINS $1 SODA CUP!  Listen, AMC, get something similar and you will have my business every time.  I cant justify going into a movie theatre and paying $4 or $5 for a soda.  So you know what I did?  I snuck it in in my purse.  Paid at the kiosk so never really had to talk to a person.  Im going to do this from now on if I go there.  I have a new purse, soda cup fits great without spilling.  GET A SODA CUP AMC!
5	Lets face it, junk is the antithesis of glamorous.  When youve got a big pile of crap you need hauled away, any guy with a truck will do, right? WRONG.  You want someone that will be on time, is willing to clean up the area where the junk is after theyve picked everything up, is polite and fluent in English, thinks of value-added services like emptying your trash bin, and represents a local business that you can patronize. Junk Guys ticked all these boxes for me.  THe guys were great and helped me out when I needed some items hauled away from a house that I had sold.  Id highly recommend them over an unknown entity or a big corporate junk removal company.  So go get your crap hauled away by the Junk Guys - youll thank me!
5	Still in love with this place and how much care they really have for all of their clients.  I hit another, I want a piercing moods and swung in on a lunch break last week, determined to get this piercing I thought would be perfect on me.  As usual Jo was absolutely amazing. He brought me back and we discussed what I wanted and when he looked at how my ear was shaped he said that I may want to try something like this (then drawing dots where they would go). He took into consideration my piercing past and said its subtleness and the petite jewelry would suit me well. And as always, I came out super impressed and ready to show off my piercings. They still look amazing a week later. Im still in love, and they are perfectly healthy. Job well done. But Im not surprised.
4	I love the concept of this place. There are three different restaurants each serving breakfast, lunch or dinner. This was the first time I went to the Farm Kitchen, since I usually go to the other place for breakfast. Anyway, their lunch did not disappoint. What I love about their place for breakfast, was delivered for lunch. There were yummy sandwiches, salads, side dishes, and dessert. I ordered the chicken salad sandwich and it was perfect. It was loaded with mayo, which I hate. It had full of flavor! I ate my sandwich outside in the sun surrounded by trees. Great place to take visitors too!
2	Theyre really slipping now.  With dinner, you get cole slaw - you can "upgrade" to soup or salad for 2.50 more.  Really?  Ive never heard of cole slaw being a pre-meal before.  I got the French Onion Soup, its actually better at Mimis.  They put way too much cheese, the bread is pathetic and theres hardly any onions in it. The prime rib comes with horseradish - very weak and cut with butter.  Never heard of that before either.  Luckily I had some sour cream with my baked potato and I asked for some raw horseradish so I can concoct my own.  Wasnt the best, but way better than the butter!   The barbeque chicken was ok.  Ive had better at diners.  They didnt really season the bird, just threw some barbeque sauce on it.  At least it wasnt terribly dry... I dont think Im coming back to this one.  Nooooo..
4	I recall my first visit to Carolinas... The time? About 1 PM. As my GPS says "You have arrived at your destination," I frantically look. I see nothing that looks like a hole in the wall restaurant! Well, I review the exact address, and note that the address (1202 Mohave Street) matches the "ghetto" building with all the nice cars parked afront. "Well, that must be it!" I park. Then I walk up to the door. The entrance reminded me of a homeless shelter or food bank. As I entered, the restaurant was filled with people. Since then, I have repeated visits to Carolinas with a few favorites... - Chips and Salsa - Shredded Beef Taco (Crispy) - Cheese Quesadillas - Cheese Enchiladas The food is low-priced. For example, tacos are about $2 each. Burritos are about $4 each. Additional Notes: - Closes relatively early in the evening. - Serves breakfast.
3	Every time I visit my parents, I pass this place and see a long line of cars. Curiosity (and a good set of luggage my parents found here) finally convinced me to stop by.  Well, its a flea market. WYSIWYG. Theres the good (nice luggage, some nice jewelry, some good foodstuffs), the bad (the same "authentic" Southwestern stuff you find in any gift shop from San Antonio to San Diego), and the ugly (several "I [heart] Columbus" Beanie Babies).  Ill come back if Im looking for something in particular (chiefly luggage or salsa) or want to get a souvenir for a relative I dont like very much.
5	I stumbled across this place after missing my usual Light Rail stop on my way to pick up a Zipcar at the downtown ASU campus. First I tried my usual caffeine fix...a nonfat double latte. Excellent. Second trip back, I gave the breakfast burrito (plus bacon) a try. Delicious. The tortilla was as good as everything inside. Third trip, a beet salad and a bacon chocolate chip cookie. Bacon and chocolate for the win! Ive been here three times and have not been disappointed. The decor is modest, but functional, as it should be at a good business with honestly good food. The barista is not only knowledgable and skilled, but is also a genuine sweetheart. Its just a couple of blocks from the Jefferson and First Street Light Rail stop (East bound), so Ive been stopping by on my way to work.
4	Our hotel was awesome enough to have beach cruisers you could borrow to ride around downtown. This is the only reason why my friend and I got all the way to Old Town on our one and a half hour break until dinner. It is such a cute little area. I loved all the little shops they had. It felt like we were walking around in an old cowboy town and I couldnt help but yell "YEE HAW!" I just had to get it off my chest.
4	Ok....my 2nd review of an "Irish" pub.  And were getting closer.  Good ambiance - I really thought it looked much like a few pubs I visited in Dublin (tho no pictures, that I saw, of the famous revolutionaries, no flags, no old photographs.  But a good draft beer selection.  And a really good Irish menu - we had the fish sandwich and the banger sandwich (lunch menu) which included chips (french fries) and I ordered a side of curry dip for the chips.  Good stuff. Good Irish music (cds) playing in the background - not obtrusive.  And a very good wait staff.  The bartender greeted us the minute we walked in. But sorry, folks, music is Thurs thru Sat and no Irish music that they admitted to - cover bands instead.  So Ill keep looking, but Ill stop here when Im in the neighborhood.
2	Waited for Mad Men characters to walk in! Seriously? Went here last night for the first time, ordered 3lb stuffed lobster, stuffed with crab & scallops, lobster was tougher than nails, scallops were tasteless, crab was ok, charged an additional $15 for this stuffing but neglected to tell us until after I questioned the bill. Hubby had a 3 lb. not stuff lobster, but were tough, questioned it and was told "they are sometimes tough", Server was great! They have absolutely no idea how to make a dirty martini! The ONLY good I can say is that the bread was great. Not going back here, seemed to me that the crowd in the bar was well over 70 and the crowd in the restaurant was mixed! Reservations? Not needed at all, the place was empty.
5	Very consistent food. Definitely a second best to P.F. Changs.
4	I like Over Easy. The former location had more charm but this one is bigger and you dont have to wait as much :) The food is great and the owners are wonderful and friendly.  We just ate breakfast there. I got the 3 eggs over easy with mushrooms. The eggs were way too raw. I told the server about it and I asked to just get 2 eggs over easy instead of remaking the dish as the kid in the table was getting grumpy. Thats what I ate for breakfast. The server didnt take it off the bill. I wouldnt say anything about it but I didnt get to eat the dish I wanted but still got to pay for it. Not cool. The Ppllo Loco is great !  Hopefully this is a one time issue and the owners are still on top of everything like they used to be.
5	This neighborhood sushi bar is one of the best in AZ! Fresh fish, good portions, and great service. A place where not every single roll is filled with imitation crab and drenched in sauce! Majority of their sushi menu is pretty traditional...but the sushi chefs takes special requests if you give them an idea of what you like. I especially like the Cucumber Fiesta, which is a salmon/yellowtail/tuna roll wrapped in cucumber instead rice. The staff is also very attentive. They check on your need often and clear out empty plates promptly. The thing that stood out most was the number of customers who are regulars. As I wait for a table, I always see people greeted by name and received with hugs. There must be a reason why people constantly come back, right? Check this place out and judge for yourself!
3	I like the Bamboo Club, but it doesnt seem to bode well with purists. It is a very Americanized spin on Chinese food, with some dishes it works well and others not so much.  I struggle with a fierce addiction to Panda Express so I refer to it from time to time, but I feel Im justified this time. Bamboo Club is like a deluxe version of Panda Express. In fact, their best dish is also the orange chicken, only done much more tastefully than their greasy counterparts.  Its a little overpriced considering what they are offering (semi-glorified mall food) but, all in all, not bad.
3	Angela, the Nurse practitioner, was great.  baby had a gooky eye and we took her to this urgent care office to see if it was Pinkeye so it could be treated early on.  It was Friday and her regular Dr. was booked up.  Angela said there was no Pinkeye but she had pus in her ears and had a minor ear infection so she prescribed antibiotics, amoxicilon I think.  The only hitch was when the baby had her regular dr appointment the next week he said there was no infection so we were left to wonder who was right.
4	While in the area we wanted something for lunch but knew wed be having dinner out that same evening. Not wanting to fill up too much we ordered an appetizer and entree to share.  The lettuce wraps with shrimp were so good! Fresh and crispy veggies accompanied seasoned shrimp all wrapped in butter lettuce leaves. It was light and tasty. For our entree we ordered the Hawaiian mahi mahi which came with a pineapple, red pepper and onion mixture over a bed of rice. The fish was a little overcooked but still tasted pretty good. Star for the water glass test!
4	Im apparently not as big into Greek as some of the others have posted, but I can honestly say anyone whos given this place less than three stars probably just expected too much. I had the best Greek salad that Ive ever had, and I will agree with one review that it was definitely too light on the feta.  The service was great, food was excellent, and while it may have been a bit on the pricey side I felt as though it was a great value. Not one of the places I would take out-of-towners and rave about, but a great little spot to hit for lunch.
4	Great service and large portions.  I like it.  Nice, clean building too. I had the alfredo and it was tastey and was really like 2 meals beacuse I had the leftovers for lunch the next day.  A little pricey, but not too bad.
4	Its pretty expensive..  Everythings about 4 dollars minimum but the food is quality.  The flavors arent very new and exciting, but you can tell the ingredients are quality and they dont skimp.  The texture is good quality.  Love the whole almonds in the rocky road!  :D
3	I ordered a thin crust for carry-out one evening.  The place was somewhat hidden in an industrial area close to Tempe Marketplace.  The staff was very friendly and it seemed like a laid-back, cozy place to eat a meal. I enjoyed my pizza.  The sauce tasted very sweet so be prepared for that.
4	Ask to sit outside, if you can! The patio is wide, clean, and fresh air goes great with a Grand Slam. Very kind manager working the day we called to see if we could bring our dog with us before we had to run off to her dog training. She said they dont normally allow pets out there, but since there was nobody outside, she would allow it unless someone complained. We got there, passed the pup over the gate, and had brinner like champs while watching the traffic. The manager came by to check on us and even brought out a bowl of water for Tatum. Like everyone says, its Dennys food... what do you expect? But I think the hospitality makes all the difference.
5	I love this place!!!!fun poker 3 days a week!!great food!!!great prices!!!even better people!!!!
4	Wooot for "grown up slushies!" This place is a staple of my Vegas adventures and was just as fun in AZ.  We hit Happy Hour for cheap drinks & apps after an expensive Octoberfest. Lord please forgive me for the extra shots of everclear on top...$1 floaters...they should be ashamed of themselves...sinful...I LOVEDDD it!
3	Taberna and Ninfas are owned by the same restaurant group out of Houston.  Is it a coincidence that the FTR for Taberna is by someone who has only reviewed both of these spots and gave each five stars?  I think not. Heres my objective review: Taberna is in the Scottsdale Seville where Roys used to be.  They have a large outside patio that will be great when the weather is nice. I ate lunch at the bar and enjoyed chatting with the friendly bartender.  The menu is upscale Mexican food.   I liked the basket of chips they brought out to start.  It came mixed with chips and plantains and two nice salsas. I also ordered the al carbon steak enchiladas.  They were good and spicy served with what I believe was a mole sauce. Overall the quality of the food was good but a little expensive.  I would come back, but its not at the top of my list.
4	On display were High School Kids Art from Apollo, Cortez, Glendale, Greenway, Independence, Moon Valley, Sunnyslope, Thunderbird and Washington. Ribbons were awarded to the most talented and there was art extraordinaire.  I can see Mike Nielsen has a genuine appreciation for the Sunnyslope Art Walk participants and enhances our community. His interior design work for home and office look very cool.
5	I love this place. Im mostly here at dinner time to pick up my favorite roasted turkey artichoke panini and sometimes salad and soup as well! The staff is super friendly and recognize when my boyfriend and I show up, maybe because he can never leave without getting a dozen of their amazing cookies! The manager Kaylee is fabulous, she makes us feel right at home and is never unsatisfactory. They may have a smaller parking lot but I guess I have always had good luck with finding a spot! I know I will continue to come back for more.
4	Yay, even though I miss living in Coronado I am glad to be back at the Melrose Americas.  If you have read any of my reviews you know how disappointed I was with Coronado Americas rude service that I boycotted that particular location.   Now that I am back around Melrose I can once again enjoy Happy Hour Tacos and drinks, or their delicious breakfast burro and cochata.  If 7th St let you down try 7th Ave.
4	This was the launch of our "Seven Summits" of Phoenix mountaineering adventure.  Our goal is to reach all of the seven summits by the end of April and we are off to a great start. Although it took us two attempts (two separate visits) to reach the summit, we did it with a few breaks and plenty of gasping along the way on New Years day. It was our way of starting the New Year on the more active side of things.  This hike really gave us a great work out with the steeper parts of the path allowing for a good sweat.  The trail is a continuous climb with a few resting spots and with plenty of photo ops to the summit. It does get pretty crowded and parking can be an issue on the weekends after the early hours. There are picnic tables, ramadas, restrooms and of course a stunning 360-degreee view once you reach the summit.
4	Good food, nothing super delicious that makes me have cravings. I havent been here in a long time, as in when the fries didnt come with the burgers (you had to order them as a side item). However, now they do come with them and are still endless, but I did notice the burger prices went up to allow for the burgers to now come with fries...something that is always expected at any burger joint. They do have sweet potato fries that you can order, big plus.  Service has always been great, they are really quick with getting drink orders in and served to you. Ive ordered a bunch of items from salads to fish tacos, and of course, their burgers. Everything has tasted decent and Im not really sure what qualifies as having "Fine Burgers" in a restaurant title, but I dont think Islands has it. The restaurant itself is very clean and the bathrooms are well kept. The only downside is the acoustics in this place. It can get very loud when its busy and almost annoyingly loud when there are a few kids in the joint.
5	I have been here at least 10 times and have never had a complaint.  The staff is friendly, the food is great, the atmosphere is lovely.   My favorites - the LB lavosh and spicy cottage cheese. I will continue to come back to Local Breeze again and again!
4	First time at St. Francis last night. Good menu selection, had an excellent server, good portion size and excellent meal.  I tried the chicken salad for dinner and it was tasty and just then right size.  They have provided a nice atmosphere with exposed brick, stainless steel tables, and just the right amount of lighting and music.   Only downside was the backless seats at our booth. Very trendy, but somewhat uncomfortable. Ask for a table instead and youll be fine.  Ill return.
1	Bad shop, rude owners. Pro-tip: If you want to "enhance" the Phoenix community you could start by not playing music loudly when its obvious that there are musicians trying to perform their sets that people paid to see at the well-respected venue next door.
4	Went there for the first time a couple weeks ago.  When I go for sushi, it pretty much consists of Nigiri Tuna and California rolls, Im not a hardcore sushi eater by any sorts. Service was good, was seated right away, took my drink order, came out.. My drink never got empty before a replacement came out (big plus for me).  I ordered one of their sushi meal things and requested it all be tuna (you get to pick), GF orders something, I think it was Teryaki beef.. Couple minutes goes by, another lady comes out and tells me I cant have all Tuna cause its too expensive.  Hey.. Im an easy going guy, I shrug my shoulders and say, "cant you chuck another $5 on my bill to make up for it?".   Im not sure what she said, but apparently that was ok :) Food comes out, I had a bite of my GFs meal and the beef was cooked very nicely and the sauce was great!  My sushi was good, you cant really expect too much out of Tuna and California Rolls other then they just be fresh. I noticed they have some nice Happy Hour stuff.  There was a flier floating around inside that said it was 2:30-4:30pm, looked like some good deals.  When I was leaving, the window said a different time for the Happy Hour special, no biggie.. I might go back and check it out
4	I love books and I love bargains. Put the two together, and you have a place called Bookmans, or as I like to call it, my book heaven. I recently purchased four books for about $30 -- thats the price of one, new hardbound book -- and was thrilled by all the great bargains I found during my casual stroll through the many, many isles of books, cds and dvds. What I love about the whole used bookstore concept is being able to give a new life to a book someone didnt want anymore.  I especially get a kick out of finding old books with inscriptions inside. One I found says:        "Pam, This is my number 1 all time favorite book. I hope you have         a relaxing holiday with your family and look forward to adventures         in the new year!" I felt bad for the inscriber, since the book obviously did not become Pams favorite, so I bought it in hopes that the inscription would ring true for me. Im glad a bookstore like Bookmans is around and that they are able to compete with the big chains.  It is a great place to find great deals, and Im hooked!
4	Food is consistently tasty and people are way cool. Take care of your bartenders!
5	Perhaps it was foolish for me to give La Condesa only four stars at first, given the fact that I really liked it.  What can I say?  Im critical by nature.  I knew I was going back soon, so I felt like I had to save the last for a return visit.  Well, it just got it. This place is fantastic.  In fact, if CenPho lets this one go under, I will personally hold all of you responsible; watch out for a citizens arrest if I ever see you.  However, that is unlikely to happen, because the food is damn tasty.   Today, the Oaxaca black mole chicken taco had me swooning, topped with pickled onions; the chicken is tender and simmered in the lovely sauce.  The Soronan carne asada taco, char-grilled over mesquite charcoal is no slouch either; Id rate it right up there with some of my favorites in town.   Go to this place; I have a feeling Ill be here at least weekly.  When and if they ever get a beer/liquor license...probably more.
5	This is by far my favourite department store, hands down. I have had nothing but perfect experiences in this store, without exception, no matter what department Im in. The shoe SAs will bend over backwards to help you find a specific shoe, and the staff will even go so far as to send out hand-written thank you cards to your home address after you make a purchase - big or small. Tim & Anthony in the shoe salon are fabulous beyond words!  I am not completely sure that I understand why people complain about the amount of merchandise on the floor or the lack of crowds in this store. Frankly, I would rather not be bombarded with merchandise and other people. One of the things I love the most about Barneys is not only the prompt attention of SAs, but the fact that they arent rushing around trying to help 35 people at once. The SAs at Barneys are incredibly friendly and will stop to have an actual conversation, regardless or whether you are purchasing something or not. I have also never experienced a "high pressure" sale situation here. All in all, Barneys is pricey, and there is no getting around it. But, um, so is Neimans and that place is a crock. Anywhere that ONLY accepts American Express or their charge card and then treats you like scum if you arent carrying neither is no place that I want to spend my hard earned dollars. Yay Barneys!
4	Post-annual-review day, I wanted to treat myself to a baller lunch, so Stingray at the Biltmore (BFP) came to mind! And it was a superb first impression! If you are not accustom to the map of BFP, its located walking distance from the epicenter of everything, but its worth the little cardio! After stepping through some remodeling projects around BFP, I finally arrived to an artistic, grand entrance.  And what I mean is you are fronted by a very tall, Japanese inspired wooden door with modern trimming.  So far so good! =) I open up and was greeted immediately by the Host and was offered to sit either at the swanky bar/lounge section or the contemporary, bamboo decor dining area.  I chose bamboo for the lounge seating. After being seated, I noticed a nice feng shui touch they had was placing a bamboo plant centerpiece next to a little pouring jar of soy sauce and a warm cloth they brought out to cleanse your hands with!  What a great lunch so far and I havent even talked about the food yet! =) As always, beverage comes first and I decided on a cool refreshing mango ice tea! Cest bon! It had the right balance, not too much tea and not too much mango! Some places is really awful in trying to get the right balance! So after spending a good 5 minutes and another 5 minutes and asking the waiter what is popular and not too filling, I opted for the Yakinuku, which is thinly sliced, NY strip steak with sauteed veggies drizzled with seasoned soy sauce.  I was content with my selection--now the waiting.  At this point I thought I gaze around and started to take mental notes on the high-end wall decorations and I mean HIGH-END! Time elapsed and my food arrived.  The presentation was just as good as everything else around me. This place was on a roll!  Before I dipped my chopsticks in to my glorious protein dish, I had to take a quick snap for my Facebook upload. And finally, I went in for the kill! Très délicieux! It tasted great as much as it smelt great!  BTW, it came with a side of white rice (not sure if brown is an option--didnt ask).  I thought the meat was cooked to a tender perfection with the right amount of vegetables topped with very flavorful sauce.  It filled me up just right.   I typically do not order dessert, but because I actually had room to spare and this place was on roll like a hot craps game, I decided to order their green tea ice cream! All I can is, perfect, as expected.  Ive had this before at other places and its either just as good or a little better. What can I say? Stingray hit a home run for a great lunch escape from the office.  I plan on doing it again!
2	The furniture was nice, but I didnt get a welcoming vibe in here at all. First of all, it smells like a dead cat in there -- perhaps its the mid-century furniture, but whatever, light some incense or something. Second, the guy working there was completely cold. No hello, no how are you, no welcome. He just stared us down the entire time, not saying a word, making sure we didnt touch anything at all. Its a frickin furniture store! How can you not be allowed to sit on the couches? I dont care if theyre vintage or antiques or the like, its not getting my business.
4	Oh my mouth-watering BBQ goodness. Ignore the sketchy neighborhood and 30 minute wait, because the meal is worth it!  My boyfriends favorite food is BBQ-anything so I left the ordering up to him (and the choice was easy): Whole Hog Heaven - 4 meat choices plus 3 sides. Settling on St. Louis and Baby Back Ribs, BBQ Chicken, and Brisket, with sides of mac & cheese, coleslaw, and beans - he was as giddy as a kid on Christmas. I was pretty hungry too - and I had to admit the smell of BBQ wafting through the back kitchen door had my taste buds excited. The meal did not disappoint to say the least. The ribs were literally falling off the bone, the chicken was cooked perfectly, and the brisket was melt-in-your-mouth tender. All 3 sides were the perfect addition, however I do have to say that the coleslaw was my favorite, especially paired with the brisket.  What sent us over the edge of BBQ heaven were the extra special additions before and after the meal. To start us off - homemade, warm cornbread with whipped butter. To finish us off - complimentary mini donuts (yes, you heard me right). Erg I would give 5 stars, but there was a hoard of drunken girls taking over the bathroom (there is a club attached to the restaurant?) that I found fairly annoying. Oh well. Highly recommended and we will be going back!
5	This is a good store for your beauty needs. They are open until 8pm too which is nice.
4	Friendly, fast service. Got an excellent 20 oz. caramel cappuccino for $4.50. Just wish it were easier to get to when you want to just run in.
4	I had dinner here tonight, and loved the entire experience! The patio was roomy, our server was quick, and the food was delicious! I ordered the Thai Cobb salad and really enjoyed the unique, healthy flavor! My dinner was priced fairly and I got a lot of food. I will be going back
4	Kristis review said, "Great romantic spot to bring a date. Secures that you will be getting action later, trust me." Well, thats good enough for me. And before the Yelp paparazzi shows up to muckrack... no I didnt take Kristi to Cheuvronts. I know better than that - I only hang with Kristi at dive bars.  So I did take my lovely date to Cheuvronts. The decor and ambiance - think wide open and urban and dark without being too dark. It really set a mood. We ordered a bottle of wine from a fantastic list, along with a cheese plate and a pate plate. We had them select the cheeses to pair with the wine we had chosen with a few instructions as to cheese preferences. They have a selection of pates as well, and we had them choose similarly. The cheese plate contained three cheeses, all superb. It was served with (good!) bread, some nuts, and some dried cranberries. The two pate plate was similarly served with bread and dark, delicious mustard. The pates were fantastic - the cheese plate and pate plate seemed destined to be served together.  The food and drink were great, the service a little spotty especially since there werent that many people in there. Im guessing the waitress just didnt want use to feel like she was bothering us. After taking our time to enjoy the wine, cheese, and pate, we were both feeling full with no room for even dessert.  Overall, a great meal, my date thought it was one of the best places she had ever been to, and Im clearly going to have to pay more attention to Kristis reviews.
4	Yup. Definitely a fancy mall for that credit card burning session. A combo of outdoor and indoor. You probably can find most everything the average person cant afford here.  It seems to be the spot for malling in Scotsdale.
2	Yes, Ive had better. The chai lattes are pretty good, but not worth $4.50 for a large(which was a grande cup size at starbucks).  Prices are just the same as Starbucks, if not more.  And they have a credit card surcharge for less than $5 spent.  I still dont agree with that at any place I go too.  I liked the local artwork displayed.  But not impressed.  If the prices were lower, then I could see coming here more often.
4	I came here on Friday with a dire craving for Soba Noodles. I have never had Soba Noodles, before and I have been yearning it since watching a rerun of Iron Chef Japan the other night. Upon glancing over the menu I decided to order Shrimp Tempura Soba, $6.95 a Squid Salad $3 and bought a soda. All of which came to $15 bucks with tip. Not a bad deal at all IMO.  I began with the Squid Salad. A more than generous portion of Squid I thought for the price. It was cooked and marinated quite nicely. Next up, the main dish. The Tempura came on the side as 2 Shrimp Tempura and a piece of Carrot Tempura. The Tempura batter was actually quite nice, no complaints there. Now for the Soba. It came in a huge piping hot bowl. The broth was very clean, fresh, and enjoyable. The Soba Noodles tasted good I thought. I cant give a comparison to other Soba Noodles though, so I dont know if they were great of terrible as far as Soba is concerned, but I had no complaints. This is one of those things where I have to try numerous Soba Noodles to make a valid argument. But as far as Im concerned it didnt disappoint. The one odd thing I thought though was that I did not see one Japanese employee in there. Kind of quirky, but oh well. This is a solid meal at a good value.
5	My sister was leaving back to Texas and I decided to find a BBQ place that may have a similar taste and feel. I found this place through a Mesa newspaper ad. Anywho, as we pulled in I was like I hope this place is good. We parked in the back and walked along the side where you can order your food to go. As we waited we decided to head inside and as we walked through the dining area to the line, I was already eyeballing other peoples plates. I could see the ribs and at that point I couldnt decided on a plate, but went ahead with the plate that had everything. I ordered Ribs, Pork, and chicken and as I was ordering I seen some sausage come out of their bbq oven. So I didnt even hesitate because every since Ive moved here from Texas, I have yet to find a place to have the yummy peppery tasting sausage we have back home. I asked for a piece of it for tasting and was granted a taste. Needless, to say I ordered a quarter lb with everything else I ordered. The chicken was without a doubt great smoked bbq chicken I have always wanted. Great flavor with not an overbearing smoke flavor. Also the ribs were tender and packed with flavor and smoke taste. The smoked pork was smoke tasty but a little on the sweeter side, but that was nothing the Habenero BBQ couldnt accommodate. Which is offered on the side. Oh and the bread tasted like some homemade goodness bread. As if it was fresh out of the oven with a little garlic butter. Superb! The Mac and cheese was super duper great. In Texas, we have bbq joints in every corner. I have tried it all and I will have to say this is one place I would have on my top list if we had it there. BIG bbq sauce thumbs up for this joint!!
3	Im not feeling the love here. Went to Hillside on the recommendation of a friend that lives nearby and loves the place. I would love it more if it was my local caf. We went on a Sunday morning, knew there would be a crowd but the wait in line wasnt long and we had a table right off.  The entire line stopped while the order taker bagged up the to go portion of my order, my friends pie to go ordered at the same time took over an hour to get to the table. What was that? the food is good the portions large. They cant afford to get a number system for the tables? A wait person stood behind the drinks station/bar bellowing my name. not even stepping around. I had to stand up and holler  because I COULD NOT FIND THE PERSON WHO HAD MY FOOD. The food was nice but living in the east valley I wouldnt drive cross town to eat here again.
5	Friendly group. Great specials....Try THE BASIC breakfast. Its more than enough.
5	When I mean 5 star, I mean 5 STARR...but this place is SPECTACULAR!! Pavle & Charleen are such a fantastic duo....they really know how to make your dining experience exquisite!  The food, not to mention the service, is truly unbelievably delicious!! If you want to have some amazing food and get top notch service while doing so, the time has come for you right here in beautiful Arizona!! HATS OFF FOR FnB!!
4	This Starbucks is located on a busy street, on a busy corner in Tempe. There are plenty of places to sit outside but who wants to in AZ in the summer right? The weekend we were there, the womens restroom had plugged up in a an ugly way but no worries, I tend ot use either one if I have to go so I popped into the mens. The place was clean (besides the toilet) very cool and even better, the staff was very cool. Its nice to get your regular drink at a Starbucks and it tastes as good as it does at your fave Starbucks in San Diego...thanks ladies!
4	More like 3.67 stars, rounding up to 4, but not any more than that which would bump it up to 5.  Yet. Let me explain. 1) Rose & Crown - The Hours. If it is really meant to be a British pub and a new asset to downtown nightlife, it needs to strongly declare A) YES! WE ARE OPEN! and B) YES! WE ARE OPEN *LATE*! When youre turned away when you excitedly show up at midnight on a Saturday because they decided to close for whatever reason, youre not going to be too excited about trying to go back the next time. Whats a British pub doing closing so early? I went out of my way to go here, to experience this new bar and enjoy its offerings, and was sent packing. Meh. So I was surprised when a bunch of Yelpers decided to make it a meetup spot a few weeks later. Well, maybe this time, at 10:30, wed be more fortunate with it staying open.  And we were. Rock on. 2) Rose & Crown - The Setting. I gather that the business owners are extremely limited with how much they can change with the house since its probably a landmark with stringent regulations on how much of the interior can be changed, but since Ive eaten at Circa 1900 a number of times before it vacated the premises, walking in here felt exactly the same. Sitting at the EXACT same 4-top table I ate before. The room hadnt changed one iota when it came to layout or furniture. Even the angles the tables were placed at. That was a little odd. The only main changes in the front west room were the giant visages of the Queen and good ol Winston glaring down at you. In any case, it was kind of hard for me to make the mental transition from "this is a sit-down restaurant" to a "this is going to be your local English pub" when it comes to the indoors. Was it nice? Definitely. Its really nice inside. But pubby? No. That said, the front balcony is a really great location to hang out on, and I can imagine how great itll be around springtime. But the balconys more an asset of the great old house itself.  3) Rose & Crown - The offerings. Standard selection of beers, including good ol English standbys like Newcastle and Boddingtons on tap. Food menu not too big, but I thought the fish & chips looked appetizing, so I ordered those. I was skeptical, but to my surprise, the fish was great, as was their spin on the tartar sauce. Fries were also tasty, but fries are fries, and Im going to devour them anyway because I was crazy hungry. But all in all, thumbs up on the food. 4) Rose & Crown - The service. Was kind of there but more present at the beginning and then invisible near the end when were ready to leave, thus having to go back inside, tell the bar manager what we ordered since he didnt have the bill, and then pay him instead of our server. Kind of odd. So all in all, as I said already, 3.67 stars. Im definitely willing to go back there and be open to editing my review and increasing its star wattage, but for now, it hasnt completely won me over. Definitely has a lot of promise, with its abundance of Britpop playing and proximity to Bianco, the sporting venues, ASU, etc., but they need to work on being consistently open late before I think about making this one of my definite go-to institutions.
5	We checked out the prices at The Dump, the sales person there just were too pushy. and their prices were not the lowest.  We checked out the prices at Mattress Firm to see if they were any cheaper.  We had a wonderful experience!  The salesperson was friend and helpful NOT pushy at all.  They had the i-select model bed that my friend was looking for.  They were $200 cheaper, delivery was cheaper, and free tempur pedic pillows.  SOLD!!!  My friend is happy as a customer.
3	Overall I liked this place and glad it is in the neighborhood.  The carne asada burrito was good and the ceviche was pretty tasty.  However, it seems that this is about all there is to the menu.   I was not a fan of the set-up of the restaurant.  It was way too crowded - yes it was lunch, but the flow could have been a lot better.  Overall, I will return when in the mood for carne asada.  Hopefully the kinks will get worked out over time and until then I look forward to supporting a local restaurant.
4	for those who like dirt track racing, this is a place to go. its a 3/8 mile oval clay dirt track that hosts the likes of imca modifieds, super stocks, pure stocks, sw modlites, bombers, dwarfs cars, sprints, late models.  after the races, go into the pits to meet the drivers and get an up close look at the cars. its a good time hanging out.  they have concessions, souvenir stand, offer free overnight camping on race nights for self contained campers only, as no services are available.  theres something about the roar of the engines and the exhilaration of the race that keeps me going back.  check out the website, www.canyonspeedwaypark.com for schedule, entrance fees, directions, etc.  hope to see ya there!
4	Right around the corner from my sisters ghetto-tastic shack, this place is bomb. Green chile tostada...hell yes!  The place is not much to look at from the outside, not much to savor on the inside, but the only people hanging out here are Chandler High kids escaping 4th period.  You stand in line, you get your paper bag of greasy goodness, you leave with a smile on your face.  You hope your sister has beer in the fridge when you get back to her place.
4	Nice views of South Mountain, lots of elevation changes and some tricky par 3s make this a very solid muni and probably the toughest in town.   First my two complaints: the chipping area should have a few more holes with a slightly larger green, and the neighborhood is atrocious.   Aguila has four features not often found at municipal golf courses: 1) You need to drive the ball well to score well here.  From a lot the tee boxes, the driving area often looks smaller than it is; so, confidence with the big stick is key.   2) Absence of generous flat lies in the fairway; even if you drive the ball well, you are not always rewarded and are sometimes faced with side-hill lies.   3) Very tough holes #9 and #18.  Hey, I like to score low as much as the next guy, but the thing about city courses is that they often give you easy closing holes with a good birdie chance; NOT the case here.  Rated 3 and 2 handicaps respectably, #9 and #18 take advantage of the same water hazard (similar to the closing holes at Karsten @ ASU) and put in play some penal, deep fairway bunkers that require precision drives and good approach shots.  #18 plays 470 yds+ from the tips, so if you hit a bomb, you still dont have a wedge in your hand.   4) Two true risk / reward par 4s - both with water, both greens are drivable from the tee.  #8 is not a guaranteed birdie from the greenside bunkers, but theyre a good bailout.  #17 is longer and is a slightly more daunting drive with a more generous bailout option to the right, these are great holes. A tip:  Take advantage of the par 5s; all but the last one is reachable in two (at least, thats been my experience).  There are only two par 3s that I would consider good birdie chances (#13 and #16), so if you can roll in a few putts, youre set. Go past Tent City, drive further south towards South Mountain, and youll find a nice municipal course in South Phoenix.
2	Slices Pizza is pretty good, not the best though. But if you are on Mill Ave its the best Pizza option.  Unos is around the corner and probably the worst pizza in Phoenix.  If the main guy that works there was not so rude probably would have given it 3 stars.  If you are in Tempe a much better Pizza place is Red Devil Pizza about 5 minutes South.
5	Aside from the Macys on 34th street in NY, this one is my favorite store.  They carry all my favorite designers, especially for work clothes.  Not to mention, the shoe department always the hottest selection of pumps.  Theres a tiny Ukrainian woman that works in the shoe department, I love her, she is SO patient with me and gives me her two cents as she keeps bringing out the shoes.   I wanna meet the buyer for this store and become her/his bestie.  They also have a personal shopper near the womens dressing rooms.  Not that Id ever have the need for one but you might.  The sales people are always really nice and helpful. On a side note: I once met this old guy who said he brought Janis Joplin to this store to buy panties when she did a show here.  Ive always doubted that story but it never fails that when I go to the lingerie department I tell myself "Im standing where the late great Janis stood."  Shes one of my all times.
3	Stopped in, had a couple of drinks, paid and left. Nothing to get excited over, but a decent stop if you like Irish whiskey and need a fix.
3	Food was tasty. I ordered the veggie combo, and was a little disappointed that it didnt come with more of a variety of things, especially for $12. BUT what it did come with was good.
3	Good Indian food not great.  Came in on a Saturday night, was craving Indian.  Not busy at all.  (Never a great sign).  The samosas were the best in town, piping hot with a great filling that was redolent of spicies and not super mild like some other restaurants.  The lamb korma and chicken tikka masala were okay.  For some reason it didnt pop for me.  It had nothing to do with the spiciness level, it was just missing that extra pop you get from a truly great curry.  I dont know if the spices hadnt been freshly toasted, or if it was lacking a crucial pinch of love that day, but I wasnt feeling it.  I left full but not quite satiated of my Indian food fix.  And the quest for the best chicken tikka masala in town continues....(oh I should mention the interior of the restaurant is beautiful, the service good, but the prices a little steep for my taste)
5	My wife took me here on my birthday for breakfast and it was excellent.  The weather was perfect which made sitting outside overlooking their grounds an absolute pleasure.  Our waitress was excellent and our food arrived quickly on the semi-busy Saturday morning.  It looked like the place fills up pretty quickly so the earlier you get here the better. Do yourself a favor and get their Bloody Mary.  It was phenomenal and simply the best Ive ever had.  Im pretty sure they only use ingredients from their garden and blend them fresh when you order it.  It was amazing. While EVERYTHING on the menu looks excellent, I had the white truffle scrambled eggs vegetable skillet and it was tasty and delicious.  It came with 2 pieces of their griddled bread with was amazing and it absolutely made the meal complete.  It was the best "toast" Ive ever had. Anyway, I cant wait to go back!
5	Yes... I love Eegees... I have to admit it could be a bit of a problem for me as I drove from Chandler to Casa Grande just for an eegee and sammich in the worse rush hour traffic. If that isnt love I dont know what is because we all know Arizona drivers are ... well you know. I always get the pina colda mixed with lemon eegee and a grinder / or turkey sub and dont forget the ranch fries! The one is Casa Grande is new and clean not that I can say the same for the ones in Tucson.
5	The best gyro you will have in Arizona... or maybe anywhere. Love the grocery selection. Everyone there is really nice. And you can buy a BUCKET of dates for like $6.
4	I came here after having wanted to try this place for some time.  I love hamburgers, and a good burger is a real treat for me.  Nothing complicated really, just a good well made burger. When my date and I arrived, we liked the interior.  The place was smaller then I had anticipated.  Very narrow seating.  Anyways, service and menu selections were excellent.  I went with the traditional burger, and my date went with the Panini.  I went with the French fries, and date went with sweet potato.  I loved both.  The excitement of my night was the fries in the shopping cart!! Anyways, I was happy with my experience here.  I would return, and liked my food.  So did date. Aside from tight seating, lovely place!
5	Love massages and facials! I would highly recommend Enrique for a massage.  Great technique.  Great membership prices and great walk-in schedule for those last minute needs.
5	You cant give anything less than 5 stars to a place that sells bras and panties to hot chicks.
2	Maybe the bagels are good, but i made the mistake of getting a chicken sandwich.. Yuck!
3	OH this shop makes me want to lose a hip or something just to fit into their clothing!!  I found not one thing in larger sizes, but my friend, whos a size 8, found LOTS of awesome vintage clothes...including, yes ladies and gentlemen, a 70s JUMPSUIT!  I am drooling and green with envy, but alas, I couldnt find anything.  Go here if youre thin (or just want to torture yourself by staring at all the awesome clothes that wont fit you unless you chop off some body part you probably need).
1	I was here for a conference and saw their sign for a $10 lunch special which wasnt available that day.  Took over an hour to just get a lunch salad.  The waiter had major attitude. Avoid this place!
4	My wife and I had visited this restaurant a few days ago with my father in law.  He is in from Chicago and watched a show on this place.  At his insistance we traveled there and ate lunch. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  The food was amazing as was the staff.  The location left a little to be desired but hey, some of the best places are in the most odd locations. One thing that separated them from the rest was the ability to try the food before you buy it.  Let them know you are new and they will gladly let you try samples of there main dishes. Overall a great time and great food!
4	The bad: the bar closes at 10pm.  It seems like the western, country, wagon-wheel themed bar that youd like to close down one night while playing some good tunes on the juke box and eating peanuts.  And also the french fries, file those under bad. The good: the hamburgers are pretty much delicious.  Definitely go for guacamole, and add whatever you want from the topping wagon. I didnt try one myself, but I hear the cookies are good.
5	Best calamari in town, and awesome service. Tokyo glow is a great drink, super refreshing.
4	3 1/2 Stars. Girls choice last night.... and we (my sister, my niece Carol, and myself) ended up at the Famous Daves in Chandler. These Famous Daves look like every other one... typically bright Orange and Yellow! At night, you must have deficient eyesight if you cant find a Famous Daves! In the evening, Famous Daves is just a lighthouse beacon in the middle of a drab mall! On the menu... Blue Margarita (** 1/2) made with Blue Curacao - Its disconcerting when the last time you saw your niece she was just drinking Cokes... now its Blue Margaritas. Must be getting old. In summary... not very toxic. Could have drank this in one gulp and wouldnt have had an effect! Machine mixed and made. Looked cool, though, with an Aquamarine Blue color. All American BBQ Feast (****) Gimmick is that all this stuff ( Full Slab of St Louis style SpareRibs (*****), Whole BBQ Chicken (*** 1/2), 1/2 lb of Texas Beef Brisket (*****), Famous Fries (*****), 2 Baked Potatoes with all the Fixins (*****) replaced the Coleslaw and Wilbur Beans, 4 Corn on the Cob (***), 4 Muffin Style Corn Bread (****) ) is served on a bright, shiny, galvanized Garbage Can lid. Some of the items definitely lacking in BBQ flavor. Hot Fudge Kahlua Brownie (**) Warm, Walnut covered Chocolate Brownie, soaked with Kahlua Liquer and topped with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, Hot Fudge, and (loads and loads of) Whipped Cream. Ice Cream and Kahlua was no-where to be found! Total tab: $82.08. Not bad for the amount of food. Service (****) This is a total generalization... but what the heck! The wait-staff at Famous Daves is totally opposite from the previous evenings robotic lifeless performance from the wait-staff at Olive Garden ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/olive-garden-italian-restaurant-chandler#hrid:l6HajH2UNtb1EZMTj19Ccg  ). I really dont give a darn if its just a performance... the attitude that the wait-staff presents will be passed onto the customers... whether bad or good. Typical of all Famous Daves you sit at a booth or table covered with Red and White checkered table-cloths. At the front entrance is a display of all the BBQ awards that Famous Daves BBQ items have won.... mostly in the MidWest. Check out the lead-pipe utilitarian interior design... Cool! Very colorful and festive atmosphere! Kids or adults with a kids attitude will love Famous Daves.
4	Someburros comes from the same family as the longtime South Phoenix staple "Ponchos". However, Someburros has somehow managed to take the family business to a whole another level! Ive been to several different Someburros and they all consistently have good food, service and atmosphere. My favorites include the Green Chile Burro enchilada style and the tacos. The beans and rice are always moist and better than that you get free chips and salsa with your meal. I like how the atmosphere is more Mexican-American but the food is definitely authentic!  If you hate a crowd avoid Lunch hours like the plague. If you are in a hurry you can also call your order in ahead of time and pick it up through the drive through take out window.
5	Always a marvelous experience. The patio area is simply lovely if the weather is permitting. The menus are always excellent and they have an excellent staff. The cheese plate is always great to start and the servers will help you pick a good selection of cheeses and suggest very good wines. The food is always very good and also unique -- rabbit is one of my favourite proteins they prepare here. I have been there for Valentines Day and also for our wedding anniversary and the always make the evening special. It is pricey but worth every penny you pay.
3	Too bad about Mandalay Noodle World. Maybe if they had stressed better service and played up the Burmese aspect they would have had better luck. Who knows? Betitos moved in, and theyre okay. The wife and I stopped in yesterday. I had a carne asada torta and a taco and both were about average. Their hot salsa took it up a notch though. My wife had something with diablo in the name (sorry, Ill have to look at the menu when I get home) and loved it. They do the usual menudo on weekends and the whole place is more or less along the lines of a Filibertos--not that theres anything wrong with that. The whole bill was less that $20, so prices are good.  Clean enough place, cheap, food is okay, and service is adequate. I would not go out of my way to get there, but if it is in your neighborhood it is worth a try. Ill probably stop here from time to time.
1	Staff is nice, and thats it. They use very cheap tires that only last for a year.
1	No offense to everyone who gave this place 5 stars, but the Tempe Cinema staff needs a swift kick in the ass. During school hours, this place is regularly crawling with hooligan truants. Maybe those who run this theatre want to ensure they will have a steady stream of staffing options from the dropouts who use it as a hideout. Losers.
3	Ive eaten here last year and this is the second year. I finally am able to compare steaks to another location. I love the decoration as its sports of all kinds. Theres always something new you havent seen before. Its the perfect place to eat and study what is around you. I had the crusted Parmesan cheese steak. I had tomato bisque and the string onions. Those are good! I had the steak and it felt like it was missing something. Im not sure what as I dont eat steak a lot.  The soup was great. It was a cup and perfect. The onion strings were good. The steak was ok. Ill always go back, but not for steak. I also wish their menu was more broad with more items to choose from.
5	Culvers is a must if you have not had the chance to try them out. I believe they have several stores now here in the valley. The Root Beer is a must as well as the Butter Burgers, Cheese curds, Frys, Frozen custurd....lol ...the list goes on... I have not found anything as of yet that I did not enjoy.
4	What can I say, this place is an Albertsons...  Definitely not high-end like Whole Foods, but not bottom of the barrel either. It is always clean, bright, and organized. The selection is vast, and since Ive seen things behind the scenes, I know they work hard to keep only fresh and undamaged food on the shelves.  disclosure: I used to work here
3	This is a difficult review to write.  My family started eating here when they first opened. We were a once a week customer. Very happy with the food and service, pizza is delicious.  Then one evening, we placed our order asking for the special we always get, a 2 pizza deal. When we received our order, they placed 2 medium pizzas on our table. I immediately asked about the pizza size as we had always received 2 large pizzas as advertised.  It turns out they have 2 specials, a 2 medium pizza deal and a 2 large pizza deal. The employee never asked which deal and the fact that we were there with 5 people should have prompted them to ask me to specify which deal. I spoke to the owner of this location he agreed to make us another medium pizza to make up the size difference to which I agreed to. Nearly 10 minutes later, the owner came to our table and told us that if he made us another pizza, he was going to have to charge us for it. I refused and now nearly 2 years later, we have chosen not to return to this establishment.  My money is important to me and it should be as important to any business, especially a small local business... I now choose a place slightly further away, but one that appreciates its customers. Pizza - delicious Customer appreciation - needs improvement Hope some changes have been made over the last couple of years
3	I feel bad for this park. Its nice. Really nice. The only problem is its in Phoenix where it is hot like heck. That means the roof is always closed. And with the roof closed, it almost feels like you are watching baseball inside of an auditorium.
4	My friends and I were in Arizona for Dodgers spring training a few weeks ago and were at the mercy of Yelp for finding things to keep us busy at night. After talking to a few of the bartenders at Bobby Cs Lounge (LOVE THIS PLACE), which we found on Yelp, they told us about Chars. On a Sunday night, Chars had live music and a packed dance floor. With an awesome mix of Old School Funk, Reggae, Classic Rock, and even a little Santana action, the live band was ON POINT! We were singing and dancing to every song! The crowd was fairly diverse and everyone was friendly. I could definitely see this as a relaxing place to go after a long day, where you dont necessarily have to wear "club attire" to fit in. The vibe was very chill and the drinks were great. Ill definitely be coming to Chars the next time Im in town.  GO DODGERS! :)
4	Q. How do you fix a broken pizza? A. With tomato paste! Ok, that sucked. Spin-at-Os pizza is actually how its pronounced as the owner learned to make pizza in Baltimore MD home of the Orioles or Os for short. Ok, I just made ALL that stuff up but it would have been cool. Right? Spinato"s pizza and calzones are amazing. Very heavy and sauce rich. If youre on a diet STAY AWAY. If youre not calorie counting-COME HERE. Their thin pizza is very thin and very good! We got the baked spaghetti w/meatballs calzone and it was what youd expect but wow was it great.  Only downside after eating here: FOOD COMA ZZZZZzzzzzzZzzzzz :)
5	Stinkweeds shaped my formative years.  Really. I started shopping at the (now gone) Tempe location when I was 15.  I had a few older friends into independent music who introduced me to this record store.  I begged my parents for rides and, when that wasnt happening, hopped on the bus for the hour-long trek.  Totally worth it.  100%.  I cant tell you how many awesome bands I began listening to just because I would browse the selection endlessly for something that looked interesting.  If I needed something specifically, Stinkweeds would order it for me if they didnt already have it in stock.  The staff was always welcoming and helpful, sometimes offering their own suggestions. But its just a record store, right?  Wrong.  Stinkweeds is the jewel of Phoenix, as far as I am concerned.  Now that its out in central Phoenix, I make it in far less.  Total bummer!
5	This is place IS Beer Heaven!  Over 100+ taps of amazing beers! This is the ONLY place I will purchase [several] beers at full price, not on happy hour.  Amazing thing #2 ~ (for the girls) they have a "shorty" glass which is a 9oz glass instead of 12oz, it is a beautiful thing! Now I can order two different kinds of beer without getting overly full (er bloated), instead of the two big 12oz glasses!  Amazing thing #3 ~ The food is delish!!! My boyfriend and I split a burger. Bad idea. It was so good we really didnt want to share it afterall ;) Amazing thing #4 ~ The staff are awesome! There are several staff behind the bar and ALL are happy and willing to help you if your initial server is MIA. They are very attentive, friendly and helpful if you cant decide :)  Amazing thing #5 ~ The atmosphere is awesome and the music they play is great!
4	We love this restaurant. Its a family-owned place and you always feel welcome. The food is excellent, especially compared to On the Border, etc. Order the guacamole. A tad pricey but its North Scottsdale, so what do we expect?
4	CARLOS OBRIENS IS MEXICAN FOOD!  Sorry for yelling but I nearly dropped my phone when I started reading reviews from people expecting Irish fare. Ive been eating at Carlos for 22 years or so.  I remember being quite young going to the 12th Street and Northern Location. They have, hands-down, the best Pollo Fundito Chimi I have ever eaten, and boy have I eaten my fair share.  5 stars Their chips and salsa are also always fresh.  The chips get also 5 stars.  Always fresh and hot.   Their mild salsa is very mild and watery.  Not my style but it fresh.  I mix the hot in with the mild which works form me. Shredded beef tacos are also 5 stars.  Love em. Fried ice cream is also yummy.  Im not a desert guy so I wont attach stars to them but yum yum. Other tips are to come at happy hour.  Good deals.  Lunch specials and portions are just right also. Carlos OBriens is a great place that just gives me comfort knowing that it is there when I need it.  I spend so much time trying new places, especially mexican, that this old favorite tends to get skipped because the closest one is 15 miles from the house. Why only 4 stars?  Only because there are more authentic places like Los Dos and Rositas Place that get 5. Ill be back.  I always will.  Next time sooner than later.  That darn Fundito calls my name.
4	We had a group dinner in one of their private rooms... the wine room, which as decent, obviously wines all around us, but a nice room for a group of 10.  Anyways, the food we had was amazing... be sure to try the the appetizer - DRUNKEN BREAD (Cabrales fonduta, White Wine, Garlic, Herbs).  For my entree I had the RIGATONCINI w/  Sweet & Spicy Schreiners Lamb Sausage, Heirloom Legumes, Local Greens,   Charred Tomatoes, Chili, Pecorino.  It was perfect with a nice kick to it. Definitely recommend it.  And for dessert...PRADO SUNDAE House Made Vanilla Gelato | Apple Wood Bacon | Caramelized Bananas  Amarone Cherries | Warm Chocolate Sauce | Roasted Almonds |  Whip Cream | Biscotti Crumble... amazing... my first bacon dessert and it was worth it.  Also, try the DULCE DE LECHE BREAD PUDDING   Bourbon Caramel Sauce | Vanilla Anglaise | Chantilly Cream.  And get yourself a mojito while you are there, surprisingly good.  Of course this is the main restaurant at the Montelucia Resort, so expect "hotel pricing."  The menus are also seasonal, so my recommendations now might be completely different when you go there.
4	yes I agree! Fellow NY-er here says this restaurant has some of the best NY pizza in town! They also catered my brothers rehearsal dinner and all the food was great. ( sausage and peppers- yummy!) Update-6/25/11 - Walked in last night to catch Steve Benson spinning the CDs and drawing caricatures-hello? Not missing that gig. Me- "Wow you remodeled the place"  LIz- the wonderful, superstar waitress- "Yeah, nine years ago" -hahahaahahah! PWEEWWT!!!! I guess I have been eating mostly take out or catering from them over the last few years. LOL! The place looks beautiful and the food is outstanding. The owner is from Smithtown, NY and I love her and this place. Manga! PS- Hello did I mention Steve Benson was there?- Again did I mention Steve Benson does first Fridays there? You can get a caricature done by none other than Steve Benson. Oops, Im sorry did I mention Steve Benson is there once a month on Fridays Dj-ing and drawing -(D and D-lol)  Being politically motivated/involved and an executive member of AEA I was in heaven! I love my teacher caricature! Check it out. Fun times!
4	Decided to stop by for breakfast by myself one Sunday morning.  The reviews on Yelp were enticing, so I gave it a shot.  I ordered the Sonora Potato and Sausage Hash (Eggs, Potatoes, Hot Links, Chipotle, Garlic, Onions, Peppers) w/side of Sourdough Toast, $8. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nEyREad5GZd3RiEZA-Irpw?select=TKoW6UY1opAaH4wFxLkFpg I couldnt wait to take a bite of my dish as I love Hot Links and have never seen it in a Breakfast item before....it didnt disappoint, it was very good.  The Hot Link was actually spicy, which is often not the case.  The Potatoes were very tasty as well.  My only complaint was that it was kind of a small portion...I was left wanting more. My server was very friendly and welcoming.  She asked how I found the joint and addressed me by name when I left....very cool. Return Factor - 98%
5	The greatest community that Ive ever been a part of!  Gilbert Crossfit isnt just a place where you can get in the best shape of your life... it is a community of friends that share the same outlook on life, support eachother in everything they do and truly care about one another.  Getting in shape and doing things you never thought possible is just the added benefit of being part of this group.  If you are looking to get in shape, live a long healthy life, and have fun with a great group of people... come by Gilbert Crossfit.. Youll never go back to a Globo Gym again!
2	Jerrys...  Ugh!  I try to like you since we live so close to each other but...  Ugh! I have had numerous irritating experiences at Jerrys.  In a nutshell... I use red Prismacolor pencils.  I run out and go to Jerrys, they dont have them, dont know if they carry them and and nobody can tell me when and if they might reappear.  Why?  The (seemingly) canned answer is because the order comes from corporate, in North Carolina or somewhere far, far away where there is no phone or email access.  I go to buy Sculpey... OUT!  Same answer as to when it might return.  I need Faber Castell PITT brush tip markers...  OUT!  The same story with some airbrush materials.  "Come back Tuesday or Thursday or just give us a call and well check if its in..."    I can walk to Jerrys in less than 10 mins but I would rather go to AZ Art or anywhere else than have to call everytime I need some stuff.  I can go to AZ Art in Tempe and when something is out can order from their mother store and its there the next day.   The clerks I have dealt with there are part of my rant.  Of the handful that I have dealt with, (mostly morning and daytime) it seems like they dont really know the store well or give a crap to give some insight on their products or company. They do have a big store and I understand that there is alot of inventory to know about and be able to locate but that is your job.  It just seems like nobody that I have dealt with there is really keyed in on knowing their stuff. I spoke to a gal there who was really chatting me up on her recent art night where she painted this huge piece and blah blah blah but when I asked if she knew when they might have more of the brush tip markers she was mum.   "No clue."  Jerrys, just clean it up and have your people act toward you and your customers with the same passion they have with their own art.  Do this and I will try to like you again.
4	I love this place because its right next to my dorm and also, its one of the few Mexican restaurants that Ive found that actually sells a Mole (molay) dish (chocolate and poblano chiles if Im not mistaken). Try the chicken Mole and youll really like it... very authentic. Chips are great, as is the salsa. You can tell its family owned... you can ask for Mexican cokes too I think. Ive gone here twice and Id go again whenever the stomach callers. Sometimes they have a wandering mariachi guy. I always feel awkward when they come around because then you feel like you have to tip, but I think he sensed we were poor college students so he didnt come by. Im not sure what you ordered that you didnt like (to the first reviewer).
5	The BEST Japanese food in AZ! Guaranteed! When you are looking for original Japanese food, or the closest taste to Japan, this would be it! The sushi is soooo fresh and they always carry out items that are not available in other sushi place like uni or sweet little octopus that I love! Their ramen is also superb and if you come here for lunch, dont forget to check in their special of the day cause they offer a great price with superb taste and lots of variety for lunch!! Love this place so much!
1	I will never go back to this establishment because all of the bouncers and wait staff are unfriendly, unprofessional and disrespectful.
4	It was a hot day with great bbq!  With the Yelp discount, admission was reasonable ($6) compared to the original $12 price, and there were a good number of bbq stands to try.  Samples consisted mainly of pulled pork with bbq sauce, although a few stands did sell items such as hot links, rib tip, and brisket samples.  I would have liked to see more stands that sold plates of food rather than samples, for those with a bigger appetite.  Towards the back there were also some stands that had food and home items for sale (e.g., Cutco knives, clothing, salsa, etc.).  It would also have been nice to see more items for sale that were bbq related (aprons, grills, tongs, etc.).  All in all, Im glad I went!
4	After work one night, I had a rediculous craving for some Thai Curry, so I remembered driving past this place and always seeing cars parked out front.  So, I thought, lets go there!  Glad I did!  I was a little freaked out when I pulled up @ 7PM, and there were no cars in the parking lot.  Then again, it is in Sun City, so their dinner rush ends @ 6, so it made sense.  I ordered the Yellow Curry with Rice and the Fish Patty with Cucumber Chili sauce as an appetizer.  Everything was so flavorful!  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great Thai experience.  I did not give this a 5, only because I am still learning about Thai food.
5	My husband called the chicken fajita burrito one bad ass burrito. The carne asada burrito and quesadilla were equally yummy. Nice stop for a quick bite.
3	The acoustics are pretty good for an amphitheatre.  The process required to acquire booze is a tad ridiculous but you have to remember that you are in Mesa.  This place would certainly rate higher if it was located in a city that allowed concerts to go past 10pm.
1	I suppose you could just put me in the "box" with "Luis T" on 3.20.10...because if i didnt know any better, his could have been my entry.. So i was here this week.  Let me start by saying i have been giving Los Dos Molinos my  business for almost 20 years now, and each year that goes by i find myself saying that i am going to cease my patronage.  I will save the stories from the recent years and why ive been feeling this way, and give you just the specifics from my most recent visit:  If you want to make the rule that there are "No Split Checks" then can you AT THE VERY LEAST get with the current times and make the bill somewhat decipherable?  We had a large party, and were quite promptly advised there were no split checks, yet at the end of the night we were left with a ribbon of calculator tape with ONLY prices, and no correlation with actual menu items...so we had to cross reference the menu to figure out what the heck all the itemizations correlated to.   And by the end of it, we pretty much gave up and just guessed at what each person should contribute because the receipt may have just as well been in morse code.  Ok, im getting ahead of myself..Its one thing if you have subpar service and the restaurant is slammed, understaffed, there is a MLB baseball game or NBA basketball game, or concert going on...This was not the case.  We were the ONLY table inside the restaurant and the service absolutely sucked.  How many times must one flag down the server for (take your pick) A;  refill on chips B: refill on ice water and C:(most importantly since the drinks are marked up 300%) a FRESH DRINK!!! Oh yes and D: Check please.  We had to look over our shoulders for A , B, C, and D.  When our table collectively decided the service was ridiculous we decided the tip would reflect that, and then we realized an 18% gratuity was included...well no wonder.  When that is the case, there is NO incentive for decent service!! We brought several items to the attention of the bald headed caucasian man who may have been a manager of some sort but his severe lack of customer service skills merely resulted in him stating in a childish voice "They are complaining about the service" to an audience that didnt exist.  Damn right! and damn right we will take our business elsewhere.  Grandma Chavez is rolling in her grave! you should be ashamed!
3	This place needs a face-lift, the whole concept and decor is outdated and needs some help. I think their sushi and other food items are alright, although they try to be so trendy and in reality there menu is pretty blah. Its a fun place to grab a drink and sit on the patio, but the excitement and trendiness of this place is completely gone.
4	A friend of a friend recommended Lou/Autoplex and I couldnt be happier.  Lou provides honest, fast service and is a pleasure to deal with.  No runaround, no nonsense, honest auto service.  Extremely difficult to find these days... I went to him for a muffler/tailpipe and then later for a catalytic converter and was completely happy with the outcome.  Additionally, he pointed out other things that I should see my previous mechanic about that they needed to fix/finish.  :)
5	I love this theater!! its 100 % digital and very clean and the staff is friendly. I believe that the have child care if you have any. also lots of great restaurants and shopping all within walking distance in the shops @ Norterra.
4	Well, we all  went to a going away party here at Casey Moores Oyster House and the place was fairly nice lots of security around  but very limited parking (we parked a few blocks away and had to walk in) food was good but my onion soup was way to salty though and the dip sandwich was by far the worst item to order on the menu (just sliced meat and bread)  and I had order it.  My wife ordered the shrimp scampi and for some reason it came out with a heavy cream sauce, no complaints because it was good but it was not scampi.  Tuna was perfect I had a chance to taste it  and that cooked perfect and I did notice a co- worker leave the 1/2 of the fish and chips on there plate no a good sign.  Clam chowder was good as a few friends did say they enjoyed it.  Calamari was off the chain "Perfect".  The server was warm,  friendly and polite and had some great suggestions for dinner and was very patient and waited for us to have  few rounds before we ordered dinner.  The place is pretty big and it seems that if you would come and sit in a different place each time it would be like going to a different place.  Music was jamming something for everyone. Folks were friendly and the place was packed.    Now, cleanliness it  seems like it could use a wipe down, moping an a power wash in a few spots but I guess after a few cold ones you dont see it anymore.  Will I go back?  Yes, I would, affordable food, good music and  folks all in a good mood Im there. 4 stars due to they are still a littler ruff around the edges. Peace :)
5	Now that I have tried all the main bubble tea/boba places in the Valley, I can say that this place is the best and most consistent. It therefore deserves five stars!
4	Horseback riding for an hour and a half, my @$$ hates me right now...but it was so much fun.   The terrain varies from dusty paths to shallow streams and rocky roads.  Id consider myself a beginner as far as horse riding goes.  I dont count horse camp 20 years ago to count towards "experience".  But riding a horse is kinda like riding a bike.  Once you learn you dont forget how to do it, but every horse is different. We had a successful ride, seeing wild horses, a roadrunner (yes, they do exist but look nothing like the cartoon one), bald eagles and their nest, roaming cattle and waded on horseback through shallow rivers and streams in the breathtaking desert.  I wanna move to Arizona!
2	We visited Frank & Alberts on a Sunday afternoon for lunch.  Hardly anyone was there, as it was about 2:30 PM.  We had eaten lunch there a couple of years ago on the patio, and I had a great time then.  However, the temp was 114 on this particular afternoon, so the patio wasnt an option.  We were the only people in there other than the dude who talked on his phone the ENTIRE time we were there.  He even managed to order and eat his entire lunch while yapping.   I ordered fish tacos, as I had the last time we were there.  Something has changed.  A previous reviewer mentioned this, and he was on the money.  I received two constructed tacos . . .soft tortilla shells in the shaper with cabbage etc.  only no fish!  Two large-ish filets of fish were on the side!  It was really messy . . .I had to tear apart the filets with my fork, smash some fish into the full-of-cabbage tortillas, and complete my own taco :(  I gave up on the second one and ate the veggie taco and the fish separately.  I really didnt like the seasoning on the fish, either.  I thought it was too harsh and blackened.  Ultimately, the fish tacos were "meh" to say the most.  I will not order them again.  My bf ordered a sandwich and since he must follow a special diet, he cannot eat mayo.  He reads ingredients very closely and requests things he cant have be left off.  His sandwich came slathered in mayo, even though it wasnt mentioned on the menu as an ingredient.  When we looked around for our server, he was nowhere to be found.  So, while I munched on messy tacos, bf sat looking sad for the next 5-7 minutes until we finally saw the server and flagged him down. That being said, the server was AWESOME about making the new sandwich sans mayo, and we even received an extra order of sweet potato fries with sea salt.  They were yummy!  And when you see their house "chipotle ketchup," DO try it!  I looked for it in the Biltmore gift shop, but they didnt have any for sale.  Oh well.   I am not swearing Frank & Alberts off forever, but since I am only in Phoenix a few times a year, it will be a while before I go again.
3	I went here last night with the BF and another couple, and we all had really high expectations for this place that just werent met. Not to say it was bad, it wasnt, it just didnt live up to the hype. The space is very cute and warm feeling. I like how the chairs dont all match and it has a very homey feel. The service was also very good. The BF ordered their home made ginger ale and it was very interesting. It tasted like liquid ginger, which was pretty cool. For food, we started with the nosh plate, which was probably the best thing we got. It had this delicious onion jam type stuff with some crackers, cashews, some meat of sorts, and a really good cheese with dill on it. The onion on the cheese was soooo good. I could have just eaten that for dinner. Then we ordered mains. The BF and I shared the chicken and waffles and our friends got the mac and cheese and the flapjacks. I was not a huge fan of the chicken and waffles, and I was so excited for it! The waffles werent crunchy at all, which I think would have been nice texturally, and the chicken was encased in the fried coating, but once you cut into it, the fried part just fell off. It didnt adhere to the chicken at all. Also, it was very thick and didnt have a ton of flavor. This was very strange. The sauce on the waffles was good, it was a honey butter or something, and the chicken was moist, but together, it was a disappointment. It did come with some wonderful green beans though.... they were seasoned and cooked perfectly. I tried my friends flapjacks and thought they were a little strange tasting... but not bad. I didnt try the mac and cheese, but my friend thought it was good.  We finished with a shortcake that has strawberries that were macerated with balsamic and basil and had some kind of cream in it. This was very good, I loved the earthy flavor that the basil brought to the dessert and the strawberries were flavorful and tasted fresh.  Overall, it was good, but not great. Maybe I had too high expectations, but I probably wouldnt run back here in the future.
5	I absolutely love their personal hotpot room!  I tried it for the first time Sunday...and went back Monday again! Their item portion is big and fresh!  Only downside is that there isnt any sauce that is pre-made... Other than that, this place is AMAZING
4	Oh....my 2am delivery staple. Their "til 3am delivery" feature is one of the beauties of Silver Mine. Their sandwiches are always fresh and these people are fast. The Dodge City w/ a side of chili is my go to. So, so good.
1	I eat a lot of Asian food (of different sorts).  Asian is actually my go-to cuisine since I have a lot of food allergies.  This place deserves a thumbs-down, unless you love Americanized Asian.  The food was bland, breaded and just not worth any money.  Next time Im in Phoenix, I definitely wont eat here.
5	What an unbelievable night we had at Mastros City Hall Steakhouse. Everything we ate was top notch, the atmosphere is fun, and the service is spectacular. How many steakhouses play Jim Croce, Beatles, and Beach Boys? Its a very welcome change. Its dark, its sexy, and its probably the best steakhouse in Arizona.  The seafood tower featured totally fresh and delicious oysters, crab legs, claws, and huge shrimp. My Kansas City Strip was out of this world and probably the best piece of meat Ive had all year. Gorgonzola mac & cheese and sauteed mushrooms were real winners as well. Im not a dessert person, but the warm butter cake should be illegal its so good. I was stuffed already when it came to the table, and then I ate all of it.  The only hiccup all night was our seafood tower was short a shrimp, and when I told the waiter dont worry about it he said ok, and then proceeded to bring us a fourth shrimp on its own bed of ice. It was a really top notch recovery. This place is absolutely amazing.
3	I would have given this a higher rating except for the prices.  Ok - in this economy, I am lucky to be able to eat out at all.  However, $11 for their smallest sandwich and two small sides and a drink ($1.99 each!!) is a little pricey especially if you have a family to feed.  They should consider making it a buffet since they charge buffet prices or giving you a little more for you money. But, yes, the food is good.
4	luckily, ive only had to take my truck in for service once and had no issues with service or quality. it is always expensive to have something auto related repaired....wish i wouldve paid more attention during shop class in high school, but oh well...i cant be good at EVERYTHING. friendly staff. they called a few times to make sure i wanted them to proceed with repairs and had my truck done in a few hours.
4	I loved the concept of this yougurt place. It is much better than Pinkberry in California. You can serve yourself a variety of flavors of yogurt. I got white boy vanilla and acai along with Mango. You pay for your yogurt by weight. This was a great place!
4	Its just fun and Ill be back ! Very chill.
5	This place is great!!! They grow alot of the food they use and if they do not grow, they buy it local!!! The food tastes great...dont forget to get a milkshake. It is also a great place to sit and eat outside, nice!
5	After talking to a number of bartenders in the area -- and doing some fairly extensive personal research -- I feel pretty comfortable saying that if you want the best cocktails in the Phoenix area, you should head to the Jade Bar at the Sanctuary Resort.   This is off the beaten path a bit, and after a few miles down streets with no street lights, it felt a bit like driving to a ski lodge up in the mountains.  Its worth the drive though.  I had two excellent cocktails ("The Last Word" and a "Pendemums Club"), and one enjoyable and informative conversation with Jillian the bartender.  Wish I could have made some of their mixology classes.
4	My first time here. Service was fast and friendly. Had a HUGE slice of pepperoni to go. Really good, fresh, flavorful pizza. Love that I can get it by the slice!
5	We use yelp.com anytime we are out of town and want a great place to eat. We werent disappointed again...Ramiros is great...generous portions, great prices, huge selection...you can even get most everything ala carte. We were visiting my parents and told them about Ramiros. They said they have driven by many, many times...not any more! I had the biggest, best carnitas chimichanga I have ever seen. Cant wait to come back and have the taco salad. Dont drive by this place!
4	We had a wonderful four nights at Gainey Ranch. The rooms were beautifully appointed (although not enough drawer space), immaculate, and high quality bath products, bed linens and furniture. We had a 3rd floor garden view, which was very Zen with a natural pond and fountain, and access to their Regency Club (a must have). The spa was very nice and they carry high quality products. They also have so many options to hang by a pool, including a private spa mineral pool (sans children). We understand there is a great kids pool also. The food was delicious at their restaurant also. We did not experience any construction issues (as they may be finished), but we certainly benefited from all their efforts. It is beautifully appointed and plenty of spaces that feel private. It is not a convention-like hotel, but I have heard (from a corporate event planner) they do a wonderful job for large parties.  Everyone from the valet, to registration, housekeeping and wait staff were more than accommodating and very friendly. Kudos to their general manager, who when we brought up the issue of not having enough drawer space, immediately remedied the situation. (I wont say how, as I dont want to turn it into a precedent. Ill just say, he went above and beyond.) I would return to Scottsdale just to visit the Hyatt. Happens to be a bonus we have wonderful family that we can visit too!
4	OK, Sweet Pea and I love us some Coup, and its not just because weve been coming here for years- since I lived across the street and could see the restaurant from my window- or because we got engaged here (which was incredible.)  Its because the food never disappoints.  You can go to restaurants and have varying experiences from the best meal of your life to terrible, but Coup is not the place for that.  Its consistent.  And consistent can be good, or bad. As consistently good as the food is, the service is likewise consistently slow (albeit friendly).  We went here for Valentines day which weve been several times and I highly recommend.  Its romantic without being showy.  They have a special Valentines Day set menu of 4 courses which is always interesting and good.  And, if you go on the day before Valentines Day, they still have the menu, but its cheaper.  Damn those greeting card "holidays".  The menu is also consistent.  The outstanding things are the brie brulee which is an absolute must-try as an appetizer, and the lamb shank.  Everything else is solidly good without being great.  The desserts are exceptional.  I like the BYOB aspect of the restaurant, although, they do charge you a lot for "corking fees", which amount to just charging you for nothing since they have a corkscrew sitting on the table and you are in charge of opening your own bottle. Coup, I love you.  You get 5 stars if you vary your menu a little, please, please, please get more vegetarian (if any vegetarian) options, and improve your service.
4	I really like Pick Up Stix and its certainly superior to that steam table garbage they try to pass off as Chinese food at Panda Express. Of course, it helps that the food is made to order.   I  also like the variety of their menu which includes salads, noodle dishes, lunch combinations and regular dinner entrees.  Having brown rice as an option is always a good thing. I had the Thai Spicey Chicken Dragon Meal ($4.99) which is an individual portion (although I ate it in three portions, it was huge), brown rice and a side salad.  Delicious and not extremely spicey.  If you visit their website, you can download coupons and order online.  Service was fast and friendly, and I will definitely be back.
1	So, what kind of place serves chicken fingers and NO Ranch dressing?????? The only sauces they had was honey mustard and "Canes Secret sauce" Can I say EEWWWW!! I thought that the sauce tasted terrible. I am not too big a fan of honey mustard but I do On occasion eat it if there is nothing else And that wasnt even good! The coleslaw was awful also. I do have to say that the chicken fingers were very juicy but also very bland. Those were the only 2 items that I tried, not that there were really any more items  on the menu, Texas toast? And Fries I think?? Overall, I would never go back.
3	Decent place for legit Chinese food with the usual fast service and decent prices. We were able to enjoy roasted duck, crispy pan fried noodles and honey walnut shrimp. All winners we thoroughly devoured. Its location is convenient and parking is readily available. Seating is plentiful so there was no wait when we arrived. Overall, a good find well probably go back to when were in the mood for real Chinese din din.
5	Our 1st visit to Renegade Canteen last night.  We made reservations and were a little late getting there,  but they had our table waiting which was nice because the place was packed.  Atmosphere is very nice.  Beautiful building and a nice layout.  Next time we plan to eat in the bar.  We had to try Bobs Big Burger and what a big burger it was!  Quality meat (bacon was to die for).  Big onion, big tomato.  What more could you ask for?  Mr. McGrath was in the restaurant and he came by our table to say hello and ask if we were enjoying ourselves.  Great guy!  And our waiter was very attentive (not pushy) but always seemed to show up at the right time. We plan on going back for sure.  Give it a try.  You wont be disappointed. Catch Chef McGrath on Channel 8 PBS "Check Please, Arizona".  He does a good job and watching the show makes you hungry. Thanks Renegade Canteen for having us.
4	Quality offering at a reasonable price? Check. Burgers fresh and cooked the way they were meant be cooked? Check. Great fries- 2 kinds no less? Check. This is a tweener restaurant-perfect for a great casual dinner. Not too expensive. Not cheap and greasy. Just right for that one day of the week when you want something in between. Enjoy.
5	I love everything at Market bistro, but I especially love the salads.  I always get the create your own with their homemade and delicious buttermilk Caesar dressing on the side.  That dressing is totally addictive!  The other thing I would wholeheartedly recommend is the Market pizza with goat cheese, artichoke hearts, oven roasted tomato, baby spinach, mozzarella, parmesan and basil pesto sauce.  It is probably my favorite vegetarian pizza.  You can get it by the slice at lunch, but have to order a whole pizza for dinner. Ive had the corn chowder with poblano chiles soup and it was great.  Ive not tried the roasted garlic tomato soup but my friend loves it.  Had a sandwich here once, with tri-tip with caramelized onions, but it doesnt seem to match the description of the ones currently on the menu.  The only thing I havent loved so far is their Margherita pizza. Everyone here is always nice and friendly.  I love that its family-owned and still doing well enough to open another location.  They now have online ordering, which I cant wait to try!
5	I used to shop her constantly when I live right across the street and I still make the drive up there, even though the prices are higher than Safeway. Why? -The staff rocks. Need a certain type of wine? They know where to find it. Need a spice? Thats covered too. Every employee is courteous, and most importantly, SPEAKS FLUENT ENGLISH. -Their deli rocks my socks. Always fresh and always tasty, Ive purchased more than a few dinners and have never been disappointed. -The ready to cook stuff is delicious too. In the mood for some kind of meat stuffed with a vegetable and/or cheese? This is the place. -I also loved the fresh food cooked every day right in the store. From BBQ to MASSIVE Sunday omelets, the choices are a plenty. Again, not cheap, but you certainly get your moneys worth. Go early if you want the breakfast, they run out quick. And you can buy good beer by the bottle! Dogfish Head rocks.
5	Delicious barbecue, we had 4 meats platter that we split with three people.  The pulled chicken is amazing, the brisket tender and juicy, the ribs succulent and flavorful, best barbecue around.  The sides were delicious as well, mac & cheese was great, mashed potatoes did not disappoint, ranch beans arent anything special but they tasted good.   Service was great, waiter was attentive to our needs and accommodated a last minute switch after already putting in the order. Atmosphere is good, not too noisy/quiet, the lighting could be improved though, a single bulb above the table barely allows you to see what you are eating, though the food wasnt there long enough to be seen:) Highly recommended to someone looking for great barbecue ribs, chicken, brisket, etc.
3	Pretty good, not remarkable in any particular way.  Last minute decision to pop up to the bar for dinner last night.   Love that they have Dos Equis Amber on draft (most places only have lager).  Chips & guac were a little diappointing....  tasted like the bottom of a bag of store-bought chips... but the guac itself not too shabby.   Salsas were unique and I did enjoy their flavor.  Had the carne asada plate which comes with rice, beans, and a really delicious authentic thin tortilla.  The beef had good seasoning and flavor, but a little dry and chewy.  Fish tacos were fine, but again nothing remarkable.  Dark atmosphere, nice bartenders.  Good pinots by the glass.
3	I came in  on an early Friday morning to buy a dozen and a half of donuts for my co- workers. The man behind the counter found it odd I order such an amountapparently, by the way he repeated my order. In my case 1 dozen would have been too little, 2 dozen too many and I didnt want to waste any. That alrady made me feel uncomfortable. Just fulfill whatever order you get, I am customer. It was my first time here, after many, many drive bys. He asked me what flavors and suggested to make a mix, I didnt have a preference, as I just liked an assortment. Again I was frowned upon. Just give me your bestselling flavors...whats the problem. Well, I guess it was once and never again. The donuts were fresh tasting, but the service was far beyond friendly. To bad, you could have earned a new customer.
4	This Ace Hardware is another gem for the locationally challenged Desert Ridge residents of which I am a part of. The staff is helpful, theyve always had what I needed and its located in a plaza with several good restaurants, a gas station, Starbucks and a Safeway.  Its so much better than running The Home Depot for an item you need, but will never be able to find on your own. Thats the great thing about Ace, you can always get help when you need it.
4	I really like this place and would definitely come back.  I had a blueberry martini that was dreamy and for dinner I had the halibut entree which was also very good.  Their wine selection is very good... I did have a glass of wine too because someone ordered a bottle of wine and I felt compelled to help him out:)  And from what I remember the service was also very good.
3	I think people have a tendency to overrate this place because it is the only restaurant of its kind.  Dont get me wrong, the pasties are great, but there are a few reasons why this place isnt a four star restaurant: 1) Its overpriced.  Youre paying almost 15 bucks for a lunch originally meant for miners. 2) Its cramped.  Good luck going there with more than one other person. 3) Its a little dingy.  Someone said the atmosphere is great.... Huh?  Not sure why a dark dining room that is six feet wide and crowded can be considered a nice atmosphere, unless maybe you grew up in a sewer. Also, make sure you get there early if you want a table or food in a reasonable amount of time.
4	One of my favorite boutiques in Scottsdale, I can always find something I dont need but have to have at Elan.  Lisa and her entire staff are friendly, helpful, and always have great suggestions.  They keep the inventory fresh and edgy.  Some of the pieces Ive gotten there never fail to get compliments.  It can be a little pricy, but everything Ive gotten there is well-made and things Ill wear again and again so... Lisa puts on some great events and really engages with her customers.
5	Im almost hesitant to tell you about my favorite sushi place because its already pretty busy...  But oh well.  I love Sakana.  Its a comfortable restaurant, I dont feel like I have to get all dressed up to go there.  Dont let the fact that its in a strip mall turn you off, inside is small, but nice.  Their sushi chefs are always very professional and keep their bar very clean- thats so important when dealing wih sashimi.  Weve taken a lot of people to Sakana and it has never disappointed.  We have tried almost all their special rolls and love their sashimi too.  Their service staff are authentic and sweet.   Ive never been disappointed. Now....stay away...cause I dont want to wait for a table....
2	Im not a big fan of this place.  I hate these "centers" where you have to park in a parking garage and pay to park.  Im already paying to go the shops and restaraunts, why do I need to pay to park too?  Seems stupid and not a good way to get peopel to frequent your business.  Id rather go to Desert Ridge, Tempe Marketplace or any other one.
5	The food on its own is very good, probably worthy of a four star rating by itself, especially considering how difficult it is to find even passable Italian food in the West Valley.  I bumped Grazie up from four-stars to five-stars because the service is very, very good, ownership is attentive and the atmosphere is very pleasant.  As for the pizza in particular: for a NY native, finding decent pizza in Phoenix is close to impossible. Good thin-crust (Italian-style, as opposed to NY- or Chicago-style), like what they have at Grazie, does happen to be a bit easier to execute, and Grazie does it well. Would I have loved to find a great NY- or Chicago-style slice instead? Sure, but good pizza is good pizza nonetheless.
5	we rode our bikes here today in search of a new place to try. the online menu looked like it had a few options for non-meat eaters (although it is very much a meat heavy menu).  for an easter sunday lunch, it was very empty, not a good sign. but we had no wait and they easily passed the water glass test. our server was very attentive and checked on us throughout the meal without being overbearing.  the decor is "country" but not like cracker barrel....more like neo farm dining.  i had the blackened fish sandwich, which was cooked really well, nice and seared but juicy, topped with onion, pickles, tomatoes and butter lettuce. i had the jalpeno and cheese grits on the side and they were rich and creamy with just a slight hint of heat...nothing to burn your mouth.  my wife had the tuna sandwich, which was also tasty and seared just right. she did have to navigate a big piece of fascia which is not that delectable, but it was her dish, not mine. her side of gigantic asparagus tasted wonderful.  i would love to come back here and hope they are able to make it here. well worth the bike ride.
5	I have long been a fan of AJs and lucky for me, they didnt open a location on the West Side of town until after I moved back to California. If they had, I would have been more broke then I was as a single working mother. The daughter and I stopped in before her hair appointment for some coffee and pastries and then I came back in once her hair was getting done. The first thing I did was order some iced tea from their coffee counter. It was absolutely delicious iced tea and very reasonably priced. I want that tea now, I think it was pineapple or something yummy.  I perused around the store, picking up some Goldwater Salsa and a stuffed Cornish game hen to cook later in the day for my Grandma from the butcher counter. I was thrilled that they still had the stuffed fresh hens for the same price I used to pay $4.99. Something inflation hadnt touched.I also picked up some huge honey crisp apples (something again Grandma can afford but wont buy for herself) and a small bunch of flowers for her.  Next time I am in town, I am going to hit up AJs right away for some iced tea!
4	Same as the others...  Clean, friendly and good.  I was able to order a chicken legs and mashed taters for one kid, coleslaw and frys for the other, 2 kids meals for the adults and no one complained. They are always more then happy to help you in anyway possible.
4	Definitely come for Happy hour! Prices are amazing, sake bombers for $3...Great atmosphere and wait staff was incredibly nice and right on to all of our needs, didnt have to ask for a thing They were always spot on...Place gets crowded in the evening especially if you plan on sitting outside. I only wish there were one in Apollo Beach or Brandon!
5	well dang gummit....git on over here and by me some camo flawj....tha kind that has little dangly moss on it....and while yur at it, i need me a gun.... too bad i already have a gun and camo. i use to be a big hunter....deer, dove, turkey, squirrel, ducks etc. its what you do in south georgia when your fridge is empty and youre hungry.  this bass pro shops is ENORMOUS!!!!! i love it. although i dont hunt anymore, my brother and father do, so every year i get gift cards for them from Bass Pro Shops. the gear and guns are more expensive than other places, but their selection is incredible. when my dad comes out here, i cant wait to take him here to see all the taxidermy and fish tanks...i know hell love it.  the staff is usually friendly. the firearms dept is a bit intimidating and the guys at the counter can be smart asses. but this place is just really neat overall. it is also a family retreat, so dont be surprised to see hundreds of kids running wild while their parents let them be terrors.
5	I have been here many times and have always had good food and service.
3	Ive been to Bookmans a few times and have mixed feelings about it. If youre going just to look around, its fun to see all the stuff they have in there. Between the movie selection, CDs, books and trinkets, it was fun to shop around. But, as someone interested in selling to them, I would never do that again. I brought in a huge selection of books I was interested in selling and they only took 4 of the books and offered me a few measely dollars. I was shocked. I understand they need to make a profit but I wasnt even getting $1 for each book they wanted. A total rip off if you ask me and a waste of time waiting for them to look through my stuff. Im not sure if I will be returning anytime soon.
3	Kashmans has great food but you really have to gear yourself up for the rude owner (artichoke lady) and some of the mean, crotchety ladies that work behind the counter.  This is not a good place to place your order by phone. Theyre always nasty and short with you on the phone and then when you pick your order up, they get all bent out of shape because you have no place to stand and wait for your order.  The guys and gals that bus are usually super efficient and very friendly and the food is above average. If youre looking for good food and a verbal lashing from the staff that work there, then Kashmans is your place to eat!!
1	The cool name of the place is the only good thing here. The burgers are below-average and unenjoyably (is that a word?) messy. Fries, too greasy. Seating, not comfortable. Skip it!
4	Ive gotta say, Nordys (as my aunt refers to Nordstom since its her favorite department store ever) is always a safe bet if youre looking for quality selection, customer service, and a very pleasant shopping experience.  Whether youre looking for shoes, lingerie, cosmetics, apparel, etc... youll likely find it at Nordys. Ill have to take Samantha Os and Julia Ts advice and remember to go to Nordstoms next time I need a new bra. In the meantime, Ive gotten lucky with shoes, all kinds of clothes, accessories, and perfume.  This weekend is a big sale.  I ran in earlier to return something and walked out with a new pair of shoes.  Oops.  Take that as a warning, Nordstrom can be dangerous for shop-a-holics. The only times I have not gotten lucky at Nordstrom are when Ive been on a mission for something specific - such as Converse Sneakers in Jareds size 7 or a certain shirt or bathing suit in my size.  But Ill overlook these times and return again and again... Keep up the good customer service and selection, Nordys - and Ill be a customer for life.
5	I love the Valley Ho! Its a beautiful property with great rooms, a fantastic pool, an excellent restaurant -- Trader Vics and a really nice spa. Be sure to stay in the newly re-modeled Loft Suite. Its two stories and its fantastic! If I was to take a stay-cation, I would be sure to stay at the Valley Ho! And for all you out-of-towners who want to stay in Old Town Scottsdale and be close to great shopping, restaurants, and nightclubs, the Valley Ho should be at the top of your list!
5	What a place!  I recently hosted a 25-person family party there, and both the food and service were impeccable.  The staff were all very friendly and accommodating, even with the dozen children we had in the group.  Leslie was the manager and she paid attention to every last detail, helping me to plan the menu and gauge food quantities for that many people.  The restaurant itself was spotless, from the outside patio down to the restrooms.  Thanks for making our family event such a wonderful success.  Everyone left full and happy.  We will definitely be back!!
5	I love this place! Ive been here twice now and walked out with great finds both times. They have a large variety of clothes - work-appropriate & fun cocktail dresses, fabulous shoes, jewelry, casual skirts and shirts, and more. The employees are very friendly and helpful.  Another reviewer mentioned $700 boots, but I havent seen a single item priced over $100.  I actually got gifts for my cousins, 2 hair and jewelry items apiece, for under $20 per person (and in the same visit found a dress for less than $40 that got me half a dozen compliments at a holiday party that night!)
4	Oh dang! This place is GOOD. I am in love with the carnitas burrito, and the employees are so nice and make some damn good food. If youre in the area and dont want Taco Bell then GO HERE! They also give you chips, and the chips and salsa are pretty legit. Try not to stuff yourself with the chips though, cause the foods the real winner here. I will be back, and have been back many many times since my first experience. Why only 4 stars you ask? The breakfast burrito was just a-okay, I would much rather get a breakfast burrito elsewhere but the regular burritos are the bomb diggity! ;)
3	I discovered this place on my way to a comedy show! It was a Saturday night with an ASU game on and was not packed so we stopped in to get a drink and a bite to eat. First impression was nice! Everything looked clean and open, which i didnt expect from the outside appearance.  The service was kinda slow. I have worked in the restaurant/bar industry for 10+ years and I understand how things can go wrong that the customers dont see so i am not going to be hard on these guys. (By the way, the girls are all dressed pretty skimpy and the guys are just short of guidos, so if you have small kids this may not be the place to bring em) So the drink service was slow and throughout we never were really sure who our server was. One girl took our drink order, another brought them, someone else took our food order, someone else brought our food, and someone else came over to see if all was ok... There had to be 15 employees and maybe 25 customers, not to mention the kitchen staff.  So the service was slow and not sure why because we were constantly seeing the staff goofing around with one another and as mentioned before it was not busy. BUT the associates were very nice the entire time so it was not bad service my any means, just slow and a little unattentive.  It seemed to turn into a club style late at night, which could explain the extensive staff.  There is a wheel that you can spin with different actions on it, such as, "kiss a random 50% off bill" "go plastic" (which apparently gives you a chance to win plastic surgery). I would suggest NOT attempting this if you are not single.  Overall, the food was GREAT!!!! The place was clean (bathrooms could use attention). The service could use some tweeking. But we were happy with it!
4	Being too "frugal" to rip out a perfectly good, if not ugly, bathroom vanity top, I decided to look for ways to improve upon the "cultured marble" 80s look that was going on.  After talking with my co-worker and fellow-Yelp-er, Robert, I decided to go the "refinish" route instead of "rip it out" and put in new.   After checking the internet I came across a company called "Miracle Method."  If you get a chance and youre thinking of having your bathtub, tile, vanity or kitchen countertop replaced, check out this company first! I did get an estimate on ripping out the tile around my tub and having a new floor installed, but that would have still left me with a no so great looking tub and an ugly vanity.  Oh, and the estimate I received from the "other" place didnt provide tile so after all was said and done, I wouldnt be saving anything.  So I bit the bullet and decided to spend the $1,600. So the job was started promptly at 8:30a.m. on Tuesday by "Shawn."  A very nice young man who obviously likes what hes doing.  (Sometimes hard to find in folks these days!)  Tuesday involved cleaning, prepping and spraying the tub.  Wednesday the tub was finished off then the tile and vanity were prepped and sprayed.  Time on Thursday was spent applying several layers of sealant to the tile area and vanity top.  Friday was a quick visit.  Shawn cleaned everything up and returned it to a much better than original version of a master bath.   Im very happy about the final results and Im seriously considering having my main bathroom redone as well.  Again, if youre thinking about making changes to your bath or kitchen, check out Miracle Method as a possible solution to your problem!  Im a fan!
5	When I think Royal Palms, I think romantic getaway. A quaint yet exquisite resort, the Royal Palms was built in 1929 to emulate a colonial Spanish retreat. Colonial as in when the Spaniards were conquering the New World.  All of the historical details are presented on a frescoed wall in one of the courtyards.   We had heard some great things about J Cooks and decided to spend a leisurely Sunday morning dining on the patio. If youre looking to be treated like royalty, you want to dine here I enjoyed exploring the hotel after a luxe breakfast at J.Cooks.  The staff are incredibly accomodating.  What an ideal location for an intimate stay-cation!  Its a nice place to go to grab some drinks and appetizers, I will definitely be back to see what more the resort has to offer!

5	This place has it all. Fresh food. Vintage decor. Outdoor misting system for those uncomfortabley-sweaty summer days. Plenty of scooter parking. Beautiful shade trees (watch out for scorpions!). Oh and did I mention the food? My favorite item by far has to be the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. Tender grilled chicken breast smothered in tangy wing sauce nestled between a toasty bun that has been smeared with blue cheese and crunchy celery. Its heaven in a bite. Coupled with a serving of Sweet Potato Fries, this is a party in your mouth and every taste bud is invited. (Even that anti-social one on the back of your tongue that doesnt know how to dance.)
4	Right after I wrote my first review of this place, a groupon deal popped up that would let me try the pizza. I jumped right on it and used it today for lunch.  We came in about 3pm and it was pretty crowded. The pizza oven was going, and there were lots of people sitting around eating gelato. A lot more crowded than the last time we came in, thats for sure. We ordered lunch, I got the marinara pizza and my husband ordered the chopped salad. The wait time for our lunch was pretty minimal. A little over five minutes. My pizza came out first and it was pretty delicious. The crust was thin, with just the right amount of fluffy in the edges, and with a nice char on the bottom from the pizza oven. The sauce was tangy and had a nice array of spices in it. It was also covered in garlic and fresh basil leaves. I really enjoyed this pizza. My husbands salad was lettuce, chopped carrots, cucumbers, roasted corn, cherry tomatoes, parm, all in a very tasty vinaigrette on top of a piece of flat bread. His salad was also very delicious. Our coupon covered our whole meal plus two small scoops of gelato, but the prices of our lunches was pretty reasonable. I would come back here to eat the food again. The gelato on the other hand, is still not my favorite. I had strawberry today and didnt finish it again. I dont know what it is about the gelato here, but I am just not crazy about it. Hence the four stars. The pizza and salads are great though. Come try those.
5	Yeah, yeah, I know there are already like fifty-something reviews for this place, most of them four or five stars, I dont care. Heres one more, another twig on the bonfire celebrating Richardsons awesomeness... The foods the same awesome New Mexican cuisine as Dicks Hideway around the corner, but eating here is a totally different experience. The dark pueblo interior with Native American rugs surrounding the high-backed booths provides a great deal of privacy for you and your party. I recommend any and all of the seafood dishes - my favorites include the shrimp quesadilla and the scallops... OMG the scallops, so good when I think about em they make me lose control and type text message shorthand like "OMG". Of course my friends constantly remind me that as much as I love the food here, I cant truly appreciate it because I dont eat the meat dishes, which, according to them, are even better. And theyre probably right. They usually are. Went with a group of 6 last week, which seems to be about as large as the booths at Richardsons can handle (for much larger groups theres a private room available at Dicks). Service was super friendly and extremely efficient. Yeah, it can be a little pricy depending on what you order, but in my opinion, totally worth it. Sometimes you gotta splurge.
3	I have to say I was slightly surprised when I went to the State Fair this year. Now I wouldnt go as far as saying I was impressed and its a must for families or friends. My sister and I won free tickets to the fair and reserved seats for The Band Perry Concert off the radio and thought that was a good enough excuse to head that way. We got their around 5:30pm and it was relatively easy to find a somewhat secure parking spot (for $10).  We went on a Wednesday so I imagine it wasnt as crowded as a weekend tournament, but this day happened to be a day where you could get in free if you bought three canned food items to donate to St. Marys Food Bank. Good way to save on admission. I think I would be a little irked if I had to pay $10.00 to get in on top of cost for game/ride tickets and food and everything else. The other nice thing about going on a Wednesday is most of the games and rides are half the # of tickets or 4 tickets per game/ride (not all of them but the majority).  Lines were short and you didnt have to wait much for anything. They sell some pretty strange fair food - I mean I cant even imagine eating fried butter, but I did have a fried Reeses Peanut Butter Cup which was pretty good.  We went around 7:00 into the Veterans Memorial Coliseum and it was easy to enter and pretty full once we got inside. We got moved to seats closer than our original section. This is a one time adventure for me and I am glad we went but the fact that it was pretty much free is what made it appealing.
5	Love this place, food is very well portioned, and yummy.  I really love the endless selection of bottled drinks offered.  Must try if your craving a soda different from the normal selections offered.  But, they do have the standby soda selections available as well.  Stop in, burgers have some crazy combinations to try.
3	Appears to be CLOSED. Phone number not in service. Went by last week & was all locked up with a realtor sign on the building.
5	I first visited this restaurant after my friend pushed me to visit the Hawaiian festival at the Tempe Town Lake a few months ago. "Big deal," I thought. "How can a Hawaiian festival be fun?" Well, the food was amazing. And after having half a rotisserie chicken, I was craving for more. A few days later, I finally began my search for the perfect (or near perfect) Hawaiian restaurant, in which I can satisfy my Hawaiian cravings. My first stop was Mai Island Grill, located in/near the Arizona State University campus. Parking was a bit of a challenge; this is especially true during the lunch hour. When I finally found a parking spot, I went in and ordered. I had the short ribs plate. The plates include one scoop of macaroni salad and steamed rice. After placing my order for the short ribs, I ordered the Spam musubi. The guy preparing food replied with a laugh. "Is it good?" I asked Jay -- the man who operates this restaurant -- replied, "Yes its good."  Then he said something about how the guy who laughs never laughs (or something like that). About 10 minutes later, my food was ready. The food was fantastic; just what I was looking for! The prices are very reasonable. Plates are about $10 and less. I also suggest that you try the fish, beef, grilled chicken, and pork katsu. And finally, I hope that this place continues to provide the same liberal portions. Also, I think it would be cool if Mai Island Grill began serving two scoops of macaroni salad and two scoops of rice (just a fantasy of mine). Additional Notes: - Cash Only. - Opens late in the morning and closes early in the afternoon (call for exact hours). - There never seems to be any "Lumpia!" :-/
3	Cliché Central.  Style without substance can be summed up in their cheese plate: pineapple, melon, grapes, herbed chevre, Babybel minis (they even leave the wax on for ya) and cubes of pepper jack and colby jack served with sesame crackers.  I cant make this gold up.   They serve a lot of "martinis" as the name implies, very few of which actually contains the ingredients for a proper martini.  But then again, now that Ive described the cheese plate, this should come as no surprise.   If you, dear reader, decide to open a bar, its really quite simple.  Get everyone drunk, quickly, and hire bathroom attendants willing to squirt soap into your customers hands.  Oh hell no, were not in a recession.  The Ferrari up front was paid in cash, Im quite sure.  And that woman over there? 100% real.   Ok that degraded fairly quickly.  Like my evening.   If you strip everything away and look at it for what it is, Blue Martini is stylish spot to get drunk in an attempt to forget reality.  If thats your thing, and want to feel better about your age, check it out.
3	Needed to get some keys made, so I dropped by here.  The key machine is located at the front of the store at the customer service/returns desk.  I popped in and they made my keys within minutes.  The girl working the machine was really efficient and got me out of there fast......which is great because I hate waiting. Will have to drop by here for other home stuff another time. Return Factor - 84%
4	Honestly I go here rarely.  My recent visit was to watch my godson while his parents were doing family picture photo shoot in the Chinese gardens and pond areas.  You can walk the whole cultural center and its gardens in 10 minutes, so there isnt alot of sightseeing here.  But to get a little glimpse of some replica gardens and seating structures from China, where else to go?  So 4 stars for the somewhat idyllic gardens in back behind the shopping plaza, cuz there isnt any other place in the valley like it.
5	Thank you Yelp... I only wish i had six Stars... Ok officially for anyone reading this pretend there are Six Freaking Stars... This place is THAT good! I thank Yelp because the only way I found this place was searching for third wave coffee (those who know what I mean by this will just know... everyone else will just have to experience and forever after never drink Starbucks again) while I was traveling in Tempe.   I dont like coffee, I LOVE it (insert Antono Ego voice from Ratatouillie movie here)... I literally have a coffee shrine in my house where I run a vintage Rancilio Z11 and pride myself on my espresso skills.  Simply put, I will never pull a shot like i had here.  Off the chart awesome!   So thats the first 5 Stars...the Sixth star?? I just cant believe they have GOOD pastry too!  I understand they produce in-house and if thats true then its completely astounding.  Easily the best croissant Ive had outside of Paris.  Run, dont walk to the Coffee Lab; it is worth the flight to Tempe.
2	This place is ok if you are so starving you dont care what you eat. The chips and salsa are great, but everything else is pretty bland. I am a fan of tamales and I would definitely not order it again. They do make some pretty good chicken tacos, but you only receive 2 small tacos and its about $12... no thanks! I would prefer Taco Bell over Mi Amigos. The staff is very nice and the service is good, too bad the food does not match.
5	Stayed here for the RocknRoll marathon like 80% of the guests and absolutely enjoyed my stay. the hallways to the rooms were the only slightly blah decor, all other things such as the bedrooms, bathroom, lobby, restaurant and pools were great! Amenities included: 1. pet fish (that someone else fed) 2. complimentary granola for the race day 3. smores for our firepit (next to the pool) 4. nice wait-staff that was pleasant and chatted us up 5. super fast towel replenishment service (4 girls use up a lot of towels) 6. great cabanas -we never had a problem snagging one or two of them 7. happy hour, decent food, delicious alcohol... 8. cool lobby area with lots of places to looooounge at 9. dog friendly 10. heated pools love it!  I will stay here again for sure..
3	This place is a hit or miss. Hence why I would rate it as average.  Ive been here so many times for lunch because its so close to work and because coworkers would suggest it.  Ive had all the curries and every time the spiciness is different even though I ask for a 3.  Sometimes its not spicy at all and sometimes its so spicy that my mouth burns.   Ive had the eggplant with chicken, but the chicken isnt as moist and tender as I hoped meat would taste like. They chopped up the chicken in very small pieces and seemed overcooked.  I would stick with the different types of curries (red, green, yellow) though.  Its safer.  The curry sauce would seep into the meat and make it more tender. The curries can also be different textures.  Ive had it where its thick and creamy (the way I like it) or more watered down.  The lunch portions are pretty small, but I guess its enough for a lunch meal.   Beware Swaddees if youre not too comfortable with spicy.  Just order a lower number and you can add more chili if its not spicy enough for you.  I still would recommend this place and try your luck with the food here.  You may get lucky and have a great meal.
5	Finally had a chance to watch a game here! Just moved to Surprise in July, and have been waiting for spring training. Very easy parking, and the seats are great! It does not matter where you sit. The diner have great food. I will be coming here a lot!
1	I took my family here and this was a disappointin experience. The service was snobby and rude.  The waitress was condescending and the food was overprices. I have not been to the other Tomasos but I will clearly discourage anyone from dining at the Chandler Tomasos. The service is clearly substandard and snobby.
3	For 6 days out of the week I eat tons of fruits, veggies, nuts, seeds, whole grains, fish, etc. Tuesday afternoons is my cheat meal and I really look forward to it. This time I was looking forward to pizza. I love pizza. We dined on Tuesday afternoon, the place was kinda empty so we got tons of attention from our waitress who was wonderful. For an appetizer we ordered the rock shrimp with garlic, basil aolioli (sp) dipping sauce. The shrimp were okay, but needed a more flavorful dipping sauce maybe a spicy marinara or barbecue. For my meal I decided to go with the soup and 9 inch pizza lunch special: butternut squash & margerita pizza. The soup was actually quite good. The pizza was good, but something was missing. Oh yeah, the CHEESE!!! Seriously, do I have to ask for extra cheese on a pizza? I really look forward to my cheat day and the pizza did not live up to my expectations. For dessert I went with the donut holes drizzled with caramel and sprinkled with powdered sugar. The order is huge, seriously there were no less than 30 donut holes. Cheat day or not it was just too much. My husband ordered 2 scoops of vanilla ice-cream. After visiting a local ice cream shop where everything is homemade, this ice-cream did not come close. Long story short, we will visit again only next time we will ask for extra cheese on a cheese pizza.
4	They must have renovated this place in the last year. It is now spacious and airy and there is no longer the dreaded "hover over a table to get a seat" necessity.  It now reminds me much more of the dreaded "Panera Bread" chain in California, but the food is still much better and has much less of a "mass produced" feeling and taste. The service (management, staff etc) were extremely attentive and responsive to requests as well as keeping the place extremely well clean and cleared. I love carbs...Carbs with carbs and a side of carbs.  They serve warm syrup with their pancakes (yum!) and their bread is just amazing.   The "side of pancakes" is plenty big for a meal and they are always consistent, fluffy, and tasty.   They offer both a dark roast and a house roast for coffee and all the powdery loveliness (cinnamon, nutmeg, cocoa) to top it off just right. Today, before returning to the land of freeways and smog and eternal sunshine(well, the other land of that anyway) we enjoyed their peppermint hot chocolate. I would highly recommend that you run on it and have this frothy goodness before the holiday season ends!
5	*CASH AND CHECKS ONLY* *OPEN 9 AM, 7 DAYS A WEEK* Love this place. Took my daughter here a year ago to get her very FIRST haircut. We had Miss Tara, who provided us with a "first haircut" certificate and she also had these tiny quarter-size ziploc bags for my daughters very first strand of hair that she cut. The haircut was $15. Along with the haircut, Miss Tara styled it and put clips and glitter in her hair. My daughter LOVED it.  The place itself was kid-friendly. Theres a little kitchen for the kids to play with while waiting for their haircut. There are 3 big kid chairs for older kids to get their haircut. And there are 2 car-styled chairs for the younger kids.  I took my daughter for her SECOND haircut today. We had Miss Annette. She was great. Again, my daughter got her hair styled after her haircut and got glitter and flowers put into her hair. The haircut was $15. We also got a punchcard, where youre 9th haircut will be free.  This place does walk-ins, but it is better to call and schedule an appointment since they dont have a specific opening/closing time. They take CASH ONLY so keep that in mind.
5	This is my favorite Sushi Spot in Phoenix. I see Sushi Chefs from other restaurants coming here to eat during their off time. =) The prices are very reasonable, and all of the rolls and sashimi are very fresh and crafted to perfection by the old timers. The Ramen Noodle Bowl is awesome, and nothing like what you would buy in the grocery store. It is topped with pork, fish cake, bamboo, and seaweed. I highly recommend. They even have a fried salmon skin roll, which was very flavorful and not always available at every establishment. I wish that i would have taken a picture of the last one that I purchased, it was absolutely perfect. They also offer Takoyaki, which is like an octopus dumpling ball. You would have no idea that it contained octopus unless you were familiar with the dish. these are absolutely amazing and highly addictive. You have to try these during your visit. The last time that I was there, I had to try the Ichigo Mochi Ice Cream. It was green tea ice cream, surrounded by a rice flour shell and topped with whipped cream. It really hit the spot and I was so full but in a happy and satisfying way. If you like Sushi, and you think that RA is cool, hit yourself on the head for being a complete fool and go check this place out and get schooled on what fresh authentic Sushi is all about. Your mouth will thank you for doing the right thing! Cheers and keep up the good work at the place. FYI... Bring your own Saki if you need booze with your meal. I say, just enjoy the good meal without alcohol and see how happy and relaxed the meal makes you feel.
5	Review #800   I had to wait for a great place to feature for #800.   Enter: Parent morning movies... in a theater that offers changing tables and dim lights in addition to their ultra nice seating, VIP rooms, 21+ beverages, good food service, incredibly friendly staff, and caramel popcorn.  Im in!!  Oh, and did I mention its a beautiful, clean theater, too? WHO: All mommies, daddies, and other care-givers WHAT:  Go see a movie with your lil one! WHEN: Wednesday mornings and occasional featured nights.  WHERE:  Listings for participating Ultra Star theaters are here... http://www.ultrastarmovies.com/parent_movie_morning.asp HOW: Because Ultra Star theater is AWESOME. WHY:  Because you deserve to get out and enjoy a movie... bonus that its a movie with Early-Bird prices of $5.75! I wanna give a shout-out to the management, staff and... whoever thought of parent movie mornings to begin with.  It was nice to get out of the house with my lil one, to do something that I used to take for granted when I wasnt a parent. haha  And then to get there and have the theater so nicely set-up, complete with changing tables and dim lights... well that was amazing.  All of the care-givers there were relaxed, happy and able to enjoy a movie without worrying about missing a part if their lil one fussed.  We all had nothing but praises for your kid-friendly attitude and made plans to meet often.   Thank-you Ultra Star Cinema for a new, great experience.  Its been a while since a place surprised me so much (in a good way)!   See ya there!
2	Took the family to the recent opening of this local Logans Roadhouse to check it out and maybe find a new local gem.  Initial impressions were that Logans is an imitation of one of my favorite family steakhouses, Texas Roadhouse. We go there every chance we can and have never been disappointed in the quality of food or service.  Anyway back to Logans, atmosphere was okay (again a wannabe Texas Roadhouse but not quite right), service was fine, but once the food came, that sealed the deal - very disappointing. Not that it was bad or anything, but the quality of the steaks just wasnt anywhere close to what you get at Texas Roadhouse, and when the prices are about the same, well, theres just no sense wasting time or money here. You might think Im being rough but when all 3 of my kids (ages 7-11) say that they like Texas better, thats gotta say something (they usually never say anything bad - they usually just eat whats in front of them!) So by now you can obviously guess that I dont recommend Logans.  I really only have one more thing to add.... .....Dont mess with Texas.....
3	If it would be closer to my area, I could give it one more star.  Their special of $4 burgers is a good way to call your attention. The best was the service, the lady that took care of us was really friendly and nice. Another time Ill have to try their food.
4	Nice clean place with good food.  Shrimp burrito - pretty tasty.
5	Great food and drink. The traditional margaritas are the best. Sara was our server and she was very knowledgable about the menu and was quite entertaining. The cheese enchilada that I had was one of the best ever.
4	Simply put, The Grind provided one of the top five burgers Ive ever eaten in my life. The peppercorn burger was piled high with toppings and as amazingly flavorful as Id been told to expect. The service was friendly, attentive, and fast. The food was juicy, flavorful, and reasonably priced. Their hot wings were flavorful and the bread pudding made a grand end to the meal. Though my initial order was brought out slightly off (with cheese despite my request) they cooked up a replacement in under 5 minutes and had it out to the table in no time. Similarly, when a friends drink was a bit too bitter for her taste the bartender mixed up a second version more to her liking, but did not charge her any additional fee. The only downside: I found the fries a tad unimpressive and overpriced. Ah well, not the reason I came here.  If youre near this end of Phoenix Id highly reccomend giving The Grind a shot.
1	Ive decided to completely write this place off, and here is why you should too: THREE TIMES I have tried to go here and they have been closed, all the while their website and posted hours say they should be open. If one of you wants to drive all the way here from the suburbs, youd better call first because this place cannot be trusted. Ive wasted my time and spent hungry minutes walking here only to be disappointed.  Vitamin T will fail, there I said it.
5	This is my favorite haunt. Whether it be St. Patricks Day, before a sundevil game or just a place to meet some friends for a quick drink. Gavin and the rest of the peeps are great. The food is the good, whether out on the patio eating bar food or inside the dining room indulging in dinner.  This place will always be the primary place to grab a Guinness for me.
1	My significant other had a $25 off coupon from Restaurant.com LOL. That could sum up the whole trip. I havent been to many restaurants that participate with restaurant.com that are decent at all. I mean, I wasnt expecting much coming into this place, I shouldnt have expected anything here. I was in the mood for some red meat, and sushi places do actually have decent dishes like teriyaki chicken and stuff like that sometimes. So, I didnt mind checking this place out since I do like a little bit of sushi on the side. The boolgogee, plain, simply plain. There was a salad with the boolgogee, but it too was plain. There wasnt nearly enough meat to warrant a price tag of $8, because the salad and rice probably didnt cost more than $0.50 to make. Oh, the sushi? All of the sushi we happened to get were either super plain or super spicy. By spicy, I mean that there were just too many tastes going on at the same time and it was too overwhelming. I tried a few bites of the 3-4 different rolls we got. After I tried each roll I thought that I liked it but that the taste was too overwhelming for me to want to try another bite. We paid $18 for the food even after the coupon, and I honestly think that even at the price it might be a bit of a rip off considering you can get cheaper, higher quality sushi at Teharu. This place is a rip-off for sushi in my opinion. Its not good enough to warrant the hefty price tag. The sad part is that the interior is very well done, if the food was actually good this place would be extremely interesting.
3	Ive eaten here one time, and I enjoyed a very decent meal.  Im not really sure if Ill go back though, and Ill tell you why.  The place kind of gave me a strange vibe: -It didnt *feel* like a restaurant, it almost felt like a business that had turned into a restaurant. -The take-out menu/brochure was worded pretty peculiarly in places. -This ones hard to explain, but I sort of sensed some very subtle yet unsettling religious undertones throughout the whole experience. Had the China wrap.  It was kinda good, even if it did taste like homemade American teriyaki.  In a spinach tortilla.  With a side of yogurt.  --*sigh* Do you see what I mean?  A funny vibe.  I cant quite shake it.  Maybe Ill give it one more chance.
5	5 stars isnt enough!!! I love the whole Briggs family. I have been going to this dentist since I was 8 years old and they have always been so amazing to me. I love that I walk in the door and they make me feel right at home. They are so sweet and everything in that place is actually super comforting. They use the most high tech things I have ever seen, and its good to know Im getting A+ care for my pearly whites. I recommend them to everyone I know!
2	Glorified Applebees. I think they want the yard of beer to cover the lack luster food & services.
2	Concept is great.  Stores are cool, but expensive.  Lunch was a bummer!  Ordered chicken salad sandwich and the tiny sandwich on a great roll with the tiniest amount of chicken salad was disappointing.  For that money I expected at least a regular sized sandwich.  Glad we tried it, but wont eat there again.
5	My husband and I have eaten Chinese food all over Phoenix, and hands down, Big Wa has been the best.  The BBQ pork with fresh spicy mustard is A-Mazing!!  We have ordered about 6 different dishes from here, sometimes totally blind and the food is always great!
5	When I lived in Phoenix, I was a regular at Fez. My friends and I probably averaged twice a week, and there were likely weeks when we were there more. The atmosphere is really wonderful, a rarity in Phoenix. The food is very consistent and almost everything on the menu is unique and flavorful. I must agree with some of the other reviews, that the waitstaff is very hit-or-miss. Ive had wonderful service and terrible service, and there are times when Ive had to go and ask the bartender to send someone over to our table to take our order... as regulars, in particular, I wouldnt think that this would be something we would have to deal with. That being said, there was one time when they were understaffed and the manager was very apologetic and even sent us a bunch of appetizers free of charge as an apology... so I havent personally experienced the attitude that others report. I miss Fez... now I live in San Diego. When I go to visit, its always on the itinerary, every time, usually as soon as I land.
4	food is good ,but they have to re-model those bathrooms they are piss soaked and the smell makes it all the way to the dining room oooff!!!!!
5	Papago has a great beer selection & awesome food. Try the Orange Blossom!!
5	Very small, but wonderful food and wine. Some of the staff mentioned that they worked previously at Bomberos Cafe & Wine Bar (now Timos Wine Bar). The concept of this place is killer.
4	I was able to get an excellent rate through hotels.com. $58 a night. Yes the room is small. But there were no bed bugs! A woman that was going to the same convention stayed at an upscale hotel near by and had bite marks all over her arm. :P  I didnt get a chance to swim in the pool, but I checked it out and it was nice up there.  The staff was very friendly and helpful. The bathrooms are small. For some reason I had to keep the hot water turned all the way off. Otherwise the water would be scorching HOT! The cable needs to be upgraded to digital. Didnt run into any ghosts. Thank goodness!
5	As close to a real, east coast deli as youll find west of the Appalachians. Delicious sandwiches, egg creams, etc. Pricy, but kids apparently eat free in summer, so we kept it at 5 stars.
4	We had our work holiday party here and we cant wait to come back and enjoy it again. We were greeted with a large wine selection and some appetizers on a back patio. The appetizers were mini pizza/bruschetta - some had mushrooms and some has tomatoes with cheese. Both were delicious. Another appetizer was a date wrapped in bacon - this was super delicious and easy to eat. I ordered a pineapple mojito and at first our server was confused, saying they dont have a blender but could make us a raspberry mojito. (Ive had bartenders tell me they dont have blenders when Ive ordered mojitos before, so I was used to this.) Luckily, our server came back later telling me she was confused and viola a delicious pineapple mojito was placed in my hands with a large slice of pineapple on the rim. It was amazing! So good, the husband had to order one for himself. Our party moved inside to a private room where we were given tiny menus with simple selections. The husband ordered the beef entree, steak with horseradish mashed potatoes and I ordered the scallops with corn polenta. While the scallops were delicious, the steak was super tender and moist! (Better than a fillet we had the night before!) For desert, I ordered the chocolate cake with coffee crema inside and the husband ordered the cheesecake. The cheesecake came in a cute mason jar and was amazing. I really liked my chocolate cake but the cheesecake was better. For once everything the husband ordered was better than what I had ordered! It was a fantastic party and such a great venue. Cant wait to come back!
3	Eh, lukewarm feelings about this one.  I had lunch here and the service was exceedingly slow even though the restaurant was not at all busy.  The server looked at me like a martian when I asked a question about the salad.   It may have been an off-day...  The food was good.  Inventive salads... it didnt exceed my expectations, though.  Hip mid-century modern decor...  Im not sure that I would go back on my own nickle.
2	I went to Eddies House last night with the BF and two friends for restaurant week and it was a terrible experience. First of all, I had made a reservation for 7:30 more that a week in advanced and we waited until 7:50 to be seated. This was a bad omen, because, as it turns out, the whole night was made up of waiting. Our waiter (who did not share his name, unfortunately because I would tell anyone to avoid him at all costs) was terrible. TERRIBLE. He came by 4 times before taking our order when we were ready after 5 minutes. Each time was a weird excuse. First time he came by I asked for a restaurant week menu, he said a restroom menu? Why would I say that, then I ordered a glass of moscato and hes like the XXXX (whatever brand it was) and i looked down and it was the ONLY moscato.... I was like ya... WTF? So I screamed what I wanted and hes like oh.... sorry.... I cant hear. Then he said Oh hey, Ill be back to explain things. Explain what? were clearly ready! Oh hey, are you ready to order? Well let me go take the order of that big table back there and Ill be back to take yours (real quote) WHAT? Seriously? We waited over 40 minutes to order. Whats worse, is that we looked over like where the ef is this guy, and he was chatting at the bar!!! What, were we not wearing the right clothes? Were we not hip enough to be served? Or was it that we were ordering off the restaurant week menu, are we not ordering enough to get service? Come on.  So he finally took our order, and we each ordered all three courses at once, because who knew when he would decide to come back. We got drinks, everyone got beer, except me who ordered the moscato. This was good, but was served in basically a thimble, it was the smallest glass of wine I have ever seen. Then we waited... and waited... and waited. We ate the whole basket of bread (which was great, but overshadowed by our terrible service). We got our appetizers, we had at least one of each available (a peach soup, a salmon flat bread, and a fetoush salad). The soup was really weird, not bad, just different. The salad was overpoweringly oniony, but still tasted good, although it was supposed to have toasted pita and had one tiny piece... and supposedly the flat bread was good, but I dont like salmon, so I didnt try it. Then the waiter came by and said oh were really busy tonight, thats why its taking a long time for the food) Notice there was no apology or accommodation of any kind. He also asked if we wanted bread with dinner, we said yes, but no bread ever came... weird.  We waited and waited and finally out food came. I ordered the chili chicken, the two boys ordered the meatloaf, and my other friend ordered the shrimp. I thought the chicken had a good flavor, but was really dry. The meatloaf was fantastic! It was really quite delicious, with onion strings, mushroom jus, and mashed potatoes... yum. Supposedly the shrimp were really spicy, but again, I didnt try it. We ate everything, so again, the food was good, the service was awful.  So then the waiter comes by (about 10-15 min after we had finished) and says, oh do you still want dessert? um.... yes, we ordered it and it comes with our meal.... he says oh, cuz I think we just ran out of the pot de creme, but Ill look Well two people had ordered the pot de creme TWO HOURS AGO!!!! Why werent they left aside? Oh we had 200 more people show up tonight that expected Well, We had a reservation, so it is not our fault that you cannot staff your restaurant appropriately or turn away customers when you are too busy to handle new diners. It does not make sense. What kind of greedy restaurant is this that they cant refuse a table when people who told them they came to eat there cant even get anything off the dessert menu. It turned out they had one left, then the other person who ordered it said, oh ok, ill have the peach crisp then....oh, well were out of that too cuz like its made fresh from peaches and we didnt buy enough for all of the extra people....  Maybe if we had been served in a TIMELY manner instead of over two and a half hours, they wouldnt have run out. Oh, and maybe if the jerk who was our server had put aside the desserts for us when we ordered it over TWO HOURS before the time when we actually got dessert, that would have been nice too. The desserts were good, the pot de creme was the best, the rest of us got a tiramisu which tasted like cookie dough ice cream.... not exactly what I want in a tiramisu, but fine, I guess.  Finally, we get the check (around 200$, so clearly we didnt spend enough money to warrant any service) and we right out how we want the bill split between the two couples, The waiter comes by, and the BF starts saying, oh we wrote down the amounts we want on each card. The snarky jerk waiter says Oh, you mean follow the directions, ok. So much attitude! So rude. I wish we left no tip, cuz thats what was deserved. NEVER AGAIN.
1	Dont know where I should start. Grand opening was on September 17th, 2010. We went to try this new Dim Sum place at the Mekong Plaza as they heavily advertised in the chinese newspapers and were advertising 30% off. When I got there, the biggest eyesore is that they tried to make their portion of the Food Court as a regular "Chinese" restaurant. So imagine the picture of chandeliers hanging in the middle of a food court in the mall. It just looks too tacky, I thought they shouldve went with a more fast food type Dim sum like they have in San Gabriel, California. Upon checking in with the hostess, they dont even issue numbers, they only call you by name. So that was already pretty different from how usual chinese restaurant run things. Totally not efficient at all. Once we finally got a seat, things got worse. Our "Har Gow"/Shrimp dumpling was raw! The skin was thick and clumpy, the shrimp was severely undercooked. We asked them to exchange for another one, and it was still raw. We also had to exchange the shrimp egg roll as it was also raw. Their excuse was that they were too busy and did not have time to fully cook the food. Ok.....so how are the other 100s of asian restaurants able to serve dim sum at a fast pace with fully cooked food? That was probably the lamest excuse. The trademark "beef internal organs" that I always love to order was pathetic. They charged the large price for a tiny little bowl, there were only a few tendons and mostly filled with Daikon.  The BBQ Pork bun, another staple of Dim sum, was not that great either. There was barely any char siu in the bun, and the exterior of the bun was not fully cooked. I understand that it is their first operating weekend, but the idea of a nice chinese dimsum place at a food court just doesnt fly in my opinion. They even offer wedding banquets here too.  I dont think Ill be returning here unless they really upgrade the quality of the food. The idea is definitely novel, but will be a hard sell.
4	You can get drunk and get your nails painted.  Huh? Its true, and it happens on Mondays.  For $10, you choose any martini you want.  Then, you drink and chat until its your turn to get your hands worked on. The chocolate martini I ordered was strong and smooth.  Definitely not watered down...just what the doctor ordered.   Okay, so the manicure wasnt something you might get at a spa, but it was a fun little silly girly thing, that I personally think is a great idea.  Still, for the price of just the martini alone, you get shiney new nails.  Not a bad deal. The people watching is quite interesting as well, I even struck up a conversation with a humorous dad of a popular comedian. Bring the girls and have some fun.
3	From the outside the place looked alot busier however, Not a bad place to go for lunch on Friday afternoon. Especially when its close to 1pm as the place was pretty empty. My coworker order brisket tacos and they came out stuffed with tons of brisket. She said they they were very good and I will take her word for it as they looked pretty tasty. Now me, I am not an enchilada person however the enchilada de avocado sounded pretty good as it had two of my favorites stuffed in in, avocado and artichoke. I must admit that it was pretty good. I only finished a little bit of it as I had filled up on the warm chips and salsa that was served when we sat down. Yum.  So why only three stars? Well Its actually 3.5 stars as although the food and the company were great, the service was a little off. Like I said the place was empty and yet our server either forgot about us at times or was busy doing something else in the back. Nicole, our server was sweet enough but still.... hmmm. Oh well no biggie. It was empty and we did get in and out in under an hour but not 5 star worthy. Will I be back again? Probably as the food was pretty good. Heck the chips and salsa alone are worth giving it another shot.
3	After watching her win on Cupcake Wars I was determined to find this place (Its very well hidden)and sample the cupcakes.  I have to say I was not impressed; i make better cupcakes on my own.  More creative and not so sweet youll go into a diabetic coma.  i did have a California BLT as well and it was a good sandwich although the bread was a little too toasted for my liking.  The staff was friendly, the ambiance was very pleasant and it was clean.  But the cupcakes...really not all that.  Sorry....
3	Food was good. Slow service. First time that Ive had to walk outside through a parking lot to get to the bathroom.
5	Simply an AWESOME tuna sandwich! Great service, and the atmosphere was really cool. Just wondering what the difference is between pickles and cucumbers in brine. (50 cents, apparently)
5	The restaurant itself is not fancy and does not have an amazing atmosphere, but I really love the food here. Ive eaten in the restaurant a few times and frequently get takeout. I love the Gobi Manchurian, Vegetable Vindaloo, and Special Vegetable Curry. I also like the weekend buffet - its a great way to try several different things. Delicious!
4	this was my first visit to a Sizzler and I thought it was pretty good. The shrimp dinner I ordered was not that great but the salad and dessert bar made up for that. The place is no Golden Corral by any means but what they got is pretty good , you will leave with a full belly . the service was good and I was able to make a strawberry shortcake from the dessert bar. So I will say YAY I am a fan!
4	Great place to shop for suits, ties, and dress clothes at reasonable prices.
5	Of the 3 sites - this is the Kindergarten. My daughter is attending here and I simply love it.  Shes five and is repeating kindergarten.  She attended kindergarten last year early at the encouragement of her preschool teachers who thought she was bored in their classes.  We are having her repeat because shes a little young for first grade, but this isnt an issue because the curriculum rolls every two years for that very reason.   In her first year - she learned to read, write, do simple math, know all her sign language letters, and has more Spanish knowledge than I do.  this year they will build upon all of that and take her further. The staff is great and care a lot about the kids.  And when issues arise they  work with the parents to get them solved both at school and at home. Its pricey. But so very worth it.
5	We went there right before my Grandmas 100th birthday.  There were about 20 of us.  The place was busy but we called ahead and they put our name in even though we still didnt have a final count of people.  The place was busy but I know why.  EVERYONE had a different dish and we all loved it.  Everyone wanted to taste each others food because we all liked it so much.  We all seem to think we are food critics and we loved this place.  Extensive menu and they seemed to nail everything we had!  The staff was amazing and would go back in a heartbeat!
4	Finally another downtown lunch option.  Im viewing this as the "in-between" place, in-between Arrogant Butchers heavy on the lawyer, heavy on the political scene diners, and in-between "Celtic-Hooters", I mean, Tilted Kilt upstairs.  The food menu is interesting, a lot of appetizers.  Not enough salads for my taste.  Compared to Arrogant Butcher and likely Tilted Kilt, the menu has less salads and less fried foods, but itll be hard to find something healthy to eat.  It veers towards the comfort food side, with options like chili with cornbread souffle, and flatbreads served with burrata fondue.  There are a few flat bread options on the menu which is their version of pizza.  The day I went, the lunch room was busy. (You enter in through the a lobby shared with Stand Up Live).  Didnt get a chance to try out their amazing beer selection, will have to try that out the next time Im here for a show.  The management and service is very friendly.  (Not in a scary way, just in a "I really want to enjoy your experience way).  This is in sharp contrast to the service at Lucky Strike across the way which Ive found to be downright rude at times.  Keeping my fingers crossed that they continue to do well.
5	I was in Phoenix a few weeks ago on a business trip. Lucky me, Thai Elephant was right across the street from my hotel! This is a tiny little joint, maybe 20 tables. The menu is like a book, there is so much to choose from, rice dishes, noodle dishes, soups, appetizers. My coworker and I settled on a red curry dish with chicken and I had a sweet & sour dish (yeah, it sounds trite, but I was in the mood and it was so delicious!) We had tons of leftovers, which we shared with a homey down the street, I hope he enjoyed it. Highly recommended, and if Im ever back in town, I will visit again.
5	Super cool, cookie/cake.chocolate maker haven!  :)  Totally worth the 40 minute drive I had - it was packed when I got there and I did not experience one little bit of rudeness.  I arrived with my 5yo and after cruising the aisles for a bit an employee came by to see if I needed help finding anything.  Super neat place!  :)
1	Have been in twice since my last review. Its a like a COMPLETELY new atmosphere!! And sorry to say this is not in a good way. Service was terrible and I was emberassed that I actually brought some new people with me to try it out. Just went for this saturdays last ufc fight! They were like natzis with the seating you have to have 75% of your party with you to get a seat even though my boys were parking and in the parking lot they gave our table away so after getting the tenth degree abou there seating rules we were finally sat all had to sit speraticly through out the bar. We shouldve just turned around right then but decided to stay... then on top of that we were sat next to some drunk beligerent people spilling and flirting with there server (wich you could tell made her uncomfotable) that table were continuosly getting over served beers. Since there was not one mgr in sight the little time we were one of my boys stepped in and there was almost a fight right then and there.. putting that aside our service was horrible some dude was our server and we went without seeing him for like 30 min and not so cold beers. At that point after one round of drinks we decided not to order food and the table next to us was gripeing about there food so that was another sign to get the F out of there so we paid (once the server got back) then bolted. I wasnt going to yelp anything BUT I just received my checking statement and the dude added 5 to his 3 dollar tip. I gave the guy 3 on $12 he was lucky to have even gotten that. Im going to find out the guys name and go to upper mgmt because this is not the first time ive heard of this happening there. With that said.. I WILL NEVER BE BACK HERE AGAIN! This place has gone down hill!! . DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE !! Very disappointed
4	This is my parents favorite froyo place, and with a pretty convenient location, we tend to automatically go to Kokomo when we want frozen yogurt. The atmosphere is fun, with a modern vibe and the frozen yogurt is pretty good. While I usually have to taste all the flavors they have (gotta weigh my options!), I tend to only find a few that are above average and worth making it into my cup. They also have the typical toppings youd expect. Prices are consistent with other local frozen yogurt places.
4	"I dont know who invented the high heel, but all men owe him a lot."  (Marilyn Monroe) A girl and her shoes...are a beautiful thing.  From bags to boots to tennis shoes to pumps to sandals, the selection (at least today) was EXCELLENT.  Not only were there a variety of brands but a variety of price points too.  This place had me salivating!  I could easily have purchased three (3) pair but decided to wait and visit again with a friend......its a chick thing!
5	Simply awesome! Great beer and great staff! Will try the food next time! Only complaint is a bartender named Adrianne she is crazy! Ha! G The food was excellent from the great hard boiled egg dish to the peanut butter and jelly with banana and marshmallow fluff oh and add bacon.  Elvis just did a sommersault in his grave.  The sandwiches are not huge but they are all made like the beer served and the people hosting, of finest quality!   Really enjoyed and will spread the word!
4	Classic Irish Pub on Mill. Perfect for fish and chips, a Guinness, and a great bar atmosphere! The food here is great. I tried the fish and chips ($12) and it was perfect. Lightly battered, perfectly fried. The chips were different but complimentary to the meal.  They also had several cider beers on tap (my favorite). When I asked which beer I should try, the waitress offered bringing a sample of each so that I could know the beer before I committed to a pint. Great service! The outdoor patio is great for parties. If its cold, they have heaters during the winter. Summer has sprinklers. Theyve got live entertainment inside on weekends and also trivia nights. If youre looking for a place to hang that is casual and fun, try Rula Bula.
1	eeew. It started with a cranky waiter who told me that if I wanted to know the specials, then I should have read them on the board. The food was downhill from there. The entire place smelled like fried onions.
2	I used to be a HUGE fan of the breakfast club, even when I had to wait in the 100 degree heat with a hangover and now I am not. I have had the eggs Benedict, the breakfast burrito, and the Greek omelet and they are all bland and quite frankly taste the same, even with the red and green sauces on the burrito. I ate there again last weekend (because my boyfriend wanted to) and I had the lox and bagel, which was down right gross. The salmon was the nastiest color and tasted almost as bad. The bagel, was well, a bagel, but not even a good one at that. Next time I am in Scottsdale I will be going elsewhere for breakfast, Ill skip the wait and the bad food.
4	Some colleagues invited me for lunch the other day and decided to pick this place.  It was my first visit.  After browsing the menu for a few minutes, I decided to order the California Wrap (Spinach, Tomatoes, Avocado, Feta Cheese, Sun-Dried Tomato Vinaigrette Dressing, Tomato Basil Tortilla, $8.95) with a side of Cole Slaw & Iced Tea. I took one bite out of the California Wrap and was in Heaven!!!  The sweet flavor of Sun-Dried Tomato Vinaigrette Dressing was a perfect compliment to the Feta Cheese & Avocado....the Cole Slaw was amazing too!  What a great combo! The only knock on this experience is that the service was kind of slow.  We had to constantly look for our waiter....to order.....to ask for extra napkins.....to get refills....to get our check.  Maybe we caught him on a bad day?  Because I enjoyed my meal so much, Ill give him the benefit of the doubt. Return Factor - 92%
4	Today was our first time eating here, so armed with great reviews from other Yelpers, we sampled a bevy of appetizers from the happy hour menu (daily from 4:30-7p) and shared a pasta entree. Of the apps, we had toasted ravioli, a platter of antipasti, and by recommendation from our lovely server, Amber, the stuffed eggplant.  The toasted ravioli was delicious-crispy and battered with a crust of parmigiana, melty cheese on the inside. A dip in the flavorful and slightly spicy marinara sauce finished it off.   The antipasti platter serves about 2 light eaters, but for me and my spouse, it was a nice compliment to the two other shared appetizers.  The stuffed eggplant was covered inside and out with gooey, cheesy goodness and marinara sauce.  This was to be the main portion of my meal while my husband had gorged on the appetizers, but after a taste, he started sneaking bites while I wasnt looking!  I added some chili flakes for a little heat, but It was very flavorful.  Im not a huge melted cheese lover and wouldve preferred a little less cheese, but it was perfect for my husband. The restaurant wasnt super busy when we arrived at 6pm, but by the time we left around 8pm, the main dining room and the adjoining small rooms were about 85% filled.  The prices were higher than what we normally spend, but we had been given gift cards by my brother and happened to come during happy hour, so it wasnt that bad at all. Our bill came out to about $17 without tip and we didnt order drinks.   You do have to sit in the bar area to receive the happy hour specials, but we didnt mind.  Well be back!
4	My girlfriend has been craving a mushroom steak and cheese sub for the past couple of weeks, and while thats easy to find in New England where were both from, its not so easy to find in the Phoenix area. But, now we know where to look. Great sandwiches and a great looking menu that well be exploring for quite a while. And they also stock a variety of Wise potato chips products which arent widely available here. For a taste of home, we know where to go, and well be back.
4	¡CASH ONLY! But so worth it. I have been  a regular at this place for the past 10 years. I am Mexican and for me this is the most authentic "Cenaduría" in Phoenix.  The food is authentic. They use the white Mexican cheese is used in Mexico. In Mexico cheddar cheese is not used on top of tacos or tostadas. Prices are very affordable. The ladies that take your order at the front desk had been there for at least 10 years and are very kind.  Restrooms are always clean and this is so important to me. If a restaurant does not have the time to maintain its restrooms clean then I can not trust them in the food being clean. The cons......BRING CASH! no credit cards are accepted. Also, they do not have the best control over flies. I always have a fly somewhere around my table. I think it has to be with no AC. They have some kind of cooler and fans. And they can have the Tv and the jukebox playing at the same time which is annoying.  The good news is that you can always take the food out. ¡Excellent food!
4	Honestly I would normally go to a specific lady to get my nails done but she rides solo and my friend wanted to get her nails done with me at the same time.  So I went where my friend goes and I was pleasantly surprised. Not to be snobby but I have done the strip mall walk in nail salon and usually walk out disappointed. I was expecting the absolute worst to be honest.  The girl who worked on me NAILED IT! Pun totally intended. I got the gel because that is all they offer. I normally get Shellac but hey...I am a convert for now. I will let you know how the hold up over time. For now my nails are amazing. Not only do they look great but it was done in half the normal time.  The reason I gave 4 stars and not 5.  The place is a little on the not so new or super clean side. Its not dirty its just not 5 stars. They also do not provide you with the nail oil my regular nail lady gives me to keep my nails hydrated. The only other thing is the lack of color selection for gels. If you are feeling like you need that electric blue, neon yellow or emerald green (color of 2013) then you are out of luck.  All in all I will probably be going here from now on unless I want a more trendy color other than Red. Walk right in and walk right out with great nails and zero guilt on how much you just spent. :)
3	Ive been there twice. Only a girl serve the table. If there are too many people,you have to wait for a long time.   We ordered the tofu soup. That was great. Others, just that taste. Not good not bad.
2	I love Coldstone like no other but this place has really bad mixers.  I came in on a late afternoon weekday, no other customers to be served.  Placed my order and figured she would give it a good solid mix.  All she did was poke my brownie into my ice cream a few times, sprinkle some nuts, and called it quits.  It was sad that I had to eat all of my brownie at the beginning because it ended up all on top!
5	Beautiful hotel, great pool, nice restaurants, fantastic service, fabulous place to stay.
4	Had the Jalapeno burger.  Great stuff. If you have not eaten here yet, I highly recommend it. Ive Had their Tri Tip, Beef & Pork Ribs, Pork, Brisket & Burgers along with most of their sides.  All were excellent. Their Drink specials were great as well.
3	The food and service was excellent!, however, several noisy undisciplined children running around in the restaurant and yelling loudly  made the dining experience less than pleasurable.  Apparently, these children were either members of the owners family or one of the employees.  Our requests to a server and another employee did little to rectify the situation.  I hope on our next visit, we will  have a more peaceful meal
5	I wish that this place were not so good - I have not been able to drink the coffee at my office in weeks.  The location that One Coffee occupies used to be a coffee shop graveyard.  Several coffee houses went out of business in this location, unable to compete with Starbucks.  One Coffee has bucked that trend and it is not hard to see why.  One Coffee has great coffee and it is amazingly consistent.  The staff is always friendly.  This place is certainly doing something right; everytime I go in there it has more and more customers.
4	Carnivores and junk-foodies, dont be put off when your crunchy granola friends want to drag you to Green. This fare may be vegan, but it doesnt look it, taste it, or is healthy for you at all. Dont get me wrong: it is completely, totally, and utterly delicious. Their fries were far superior to many traditional burger joints. But... theyre still FRENCH FRIES, people. The jerk tofu salad was impressively spicy, but laden in too-many FRIED won ton strips and chunks of FRIED tofu. Do you see the theme? No wonder my SO nodded enthusiastically throughout the whole meal and offered to come back any time.  I had the G po-boy, buffalo "chicken" on a big spongy roll, dripping and oozing in spicy sauce and vegan mayo. The fake meat they use is really, really, really authentic. Like, so authentic, Im not going to get it next time because I really dont like meat in the first place, hence my vegetarianism. Stringy fibers in my fake chicken grosses me out as much as the stringy fibers in real chicken. The sandwich was tasty -- the bread surprisingly excellent -- but greasy.  So yeah. Two hesitant thumbs up. Ill definitely go again, although Ill have to dig a little deeper on the menu to find something not quite so artery hardening.
4	I love that the airport has a place with fresh, healthy, customizable food! Paradise Bakery has a salad bar (how often have you seen an airport with a salad bar?!), and though they dont have the hugest selection of toppings there are a good number of interesting options beyond just tomato/cucumber/carrots. The bakery section has a lot of tempting treats and a good standard selection of sandwiches.
5	I have been here a few times but have to remember to come here more often.  I LOVE it!  Ive never made it past the refrigerated and prepared foods section, but who needs to! You can find everything you need right there.  The meat section is beautiful to look at, they have a whole section of prepared heat and eat dinners, side, soups, sauces etc. grab a premade one or grab a few ingredients and make your own!  My favorite so far would be the Tub of Alfredo sauce, package of fresh pasta, and package of chicken breast strips ..YUM!  Dinner in 20 anyone? ;-) Their Tomato basil soup is Amazing too!!  I scored dinner for 3 last night for ......$7!!!!  2 packages of their heat and eat mac and cheese and 2 packages of Tilapia, all ready and in about 10 minutes!  Seriously if you are trying to save money and still want to eat good, fresh and easy food then this your place!
5	Great atmosphere and food. We keep coming back!
4	I like to start out any restaurant reviews with Im a vegetarian so my choice of food is limited. Please take that in to consideration. Ive been here once before and had breakfast, and it might have been one of the best breakfasts in the world. I would have given it 5 stars if I wrote my review that day.  I went yesterday for a sandwich and salad and thought it was so so at best. I was a little bummed about the instruction, or lack of instruction from the staff on how to order. It appears, and I didnt know this while ordering, that you can pick what ingredients you want to add or delete from certain sandwiches or salads. I got what I got, and it didnt exactly include what I like, or what I didnt.  Today I would give it three stars, but since I liked the breakfast so much, Ill mix the review to give it 4 stars. Only fair.  Ill go back and give it a try again sometime. Im in no rush to get there, but I wouldnt avoid the place either. For breakfast, if I do want some french toast, waffles, or pancakes Ill head down to give a second shot for sure!
4	Best latte ever!!!  I missed my local coffee shop in Phoenix and I stumbled upon Echo.  I am so happy I found this place.  Free Wi-fi and AMAZING lattes have won me over!  I recommend the Turkey & Brie sandwich.  The pear made the sandwich.  They have a great music selection and they dont crank up the volume.  Check this place out!
4	I was a little bit scared to eat at this place but I was pleasantly surprised. I got the chicken egg foo yung and boyfriend got spicy shrimp. The portions were humongous and it was very delicious. The Buffett didnt look very appetizing. I would definitely only order from the dinner menu. Cant wait to go back.  Food is dirt cheap and so delicious.
3	While in Phoenix for about 36 hours, I lunched at Hooters twice. It was easily located across from my hotel and it was a weekend, which meant I could catch both the collegiate and professional football games as well as playoff baseball.  I take Hooters for what it is, pretty decent fried food, a restaurant that caters to men, and always has a game on. This in mind, I didnt anticipate anything other then a beer and something to eat. I sat at the bar both times and the bartender, Brittany was extremely friendly and made a point to learn (while IDing) and remember everyones name-- which I thought was a nice touch. She was always willing to change channels to make sure everyones game was being aired which was appreciated as well. They have a good football special-- 10 boneless wings with all you can eat fries for $5.99 during any football game.  The $3.50 25oz Shock Top beers were a deal as well.  It was odd for me to see a kids birthday party in the restaurant on Sunday, but to each their own.
5	A yummy Mexican Sunnyslope dive.  The oatmeal horchata is tasty!  THE torta is really an experience!
3	The fish tacos were good and the trendy atmosphere was nice. But, the whole thing was a bit too formula...like "restaurant in a box" concept. No outlyers, not much spice, fairly bland, middle of the road.....but wait, its in Arizona! Ok, no political jokes re Arizona. I was so-so with Blanco and will continue to explore on the next visit.
5	Potbelly, you have been handed the torch. It was a good ride Jimmy Johns, but you have no locations close to my newly purchased home.  Its not you, its me.  I promise. I love italian-style subs.  The Wreck at Potbelly is fantastic.  The Wreck salad is also great (for a salad).   This place is my new go to sub shack.
5	Ive been to this location a few times, but this was by far the best experience Ive had. It was two Sundays ago, myself and seven friends wanted to watch the early games and get some food and drinks. My friend called ahead and made a reservation. When we got there, we had a big table reserved right in front of all the TVs. Our waitress was very attentive, friendly and quick. They had a bunch of beer bucket deals that we all took advantage of and had a great time watching all the games, enjoying some beverages and eating some food. Their breakfast burrito with chorizo was fantastic and itll keep me coming back. See ya next Sunday, Majerles!
5	great beer selection great live music great atmosphere I used to live across the street and nightcap it here everynight. there is always something to be had at rosies.
3	Fair pricing and no upselling. These guys are good--but be warned, its as busy as an angry beehive on Monday mornings!
4	Hole in the wall? Yes Amazing food? Definitely Clean? Questionable but I could care less The tortillas are really as good as everyone claims. Food was prepared pretty quickly. I had two machaca tacos and the beef was really tender and flavorful. A friend from Phoenix recommended this place and we stopped by on a trip from up north. Next time Im in Phoenix Ill make sure to stop by!
3	-1* Dropped in for my 3rd visit & still no menu board or the other offerings that made them different....no cupcake, boba, etc.  Tried the pistachio fro yo & it had an artificial after taste.  Guess Im driving back to Yogurtland for now.
4	Went to Pho Avina (which I could easily recommend to anyone) a few weeks ago with my 2nd dad and he spies the Korean BBQ place (note their signage all says Korean BBQ and not Chuhgajib) and he grabs a menu and we make note to ourselves to check it out (of course, not until after I checked out the other reviews on Yelp) So we head there for lunch today. Now, I know this about Korean food...I ate kimchi made by the mother of one of my daughters friends and it was good. Beyond that, I know that when I flip on LPGA on television to watch the hottee Paula Creamer, some Korean chick is depriving her of a victory and I am none too pleased but it does appear that they understand food...but I digress. Lunch specials $ 4.95 - OK...Im suspicious. Includes 3 pieces of california roll, salad, rice, vegetable and entree. Too cheap.  We order gyoza and egg roll appetizers. Evidently gyoza in Korean restaurant is different than Chinese restaurant but is scrumptious nonetheless. Egg rolls more typical to my expectations and very tasty - Im optimistic. Tea is in big weird cup with no handle and waaay too hot to actually pick up but tea bag says Liptons...Im still suspicious. Salad, underwhelming but I am impressed with silver chopsticks that work well for me. Comes the lunch platter... - California Rolls, AOK  - big mound of white rice, perfect - pickled vegables, tasty and interesting - sweet/sour vegetables, tasty and interesting...wishing someone could tell me what it was I was eating but hey, its all good. - meat (I had bbq pork but forget the name) mildly spiced, nice, a little dry but that may have been intentional...my knowledge of Korean clearly fails me here. 2nd dad got bbq beef and it was very tasty, not spicy, much more moist. We left stuffed, happy amazed that lunch could be so good and so cheap. Place was packed and its obvious why. Inexpensive, tasty, no disappointments and very clean. Woman who ran the restaurant wears sneakers and reminded me of a track star because she handled a packed restaurant but hardly seemed to work up a sweat and handled a bunch of to go orders as well. I have to say...49th Avenue and Thunderbird, two excellent Asian restaurants practically side by side and you cant go wrong at either place. You can gorge yourself for $10 here. You could drink water and have a $6 lunch that puts a Big Mac to shame.
4	HARISSA SPICED FRIES. Need I say more? The wine list is exceptional, and they are open late, both of which are mandatory if youre a boozy creature of the night like me. Our server was quite attentive without being intrusive. Our wine glasses were never dry, and she instinctively sensed that it would be a three bottle sort of night and suggested additional bottles to go with our meal. The food was of a generous proportion, so bear this in mind when ordering. My Fez Salad was fresh, crisp, and the combination of the dressing and goat cheese hit the spot. Our hummus platter was heaven-sent, and had just the right amount of garlic. The lamb kisra was also exceptional, and immediately devoured. The aforementioned Harissa fries were fiery and I often dream of them. No, really. If Fez was located in Tucson, I would gain at least ten pounds from just eating harissa fries every day. Harissa, for those of you who are unfamiliar, is a North African chili-based spice that has a lovely smoky quality. I highly recommend it! Well, Fez. Im in Phoenix next weekend. Prepare yourself for round two.
4	I got  to give In-N-Out Burger some love. Ive been wrestling with a rating on this place for a long time. Its definitely a WIN when you can feed two hungry college aged boys and yours truly for under $15 bucks with some delicious food. They always get your orders right, keep the place clean and are UBER Friendly with fresh delicious burgers. No wonder this place is always mobbed well past the traditional lunch hours with families. Keep up the good work IN-N Out Burger!
3	It serves the purpose.  Thats about it. Raging Waters it is not. A smaller water park attached to a mini golf course it is. Slides are fun. Night splash is great--no sun, bearable temperatures and no sun burn. I definitely would never go during the day. I couldnt imagine standing in line for 1 hour+ with no shade, 110+ temps and broken misters (I didnt see a functioning mister in the entire park).  Park could use a bit maintenance. Staff could use a bit of training.  Lines were very disorganized. Staff didnt have much of a clue as to what was going on. Ex:  spent our last 45 minutes waiting for the wave pool, getting into the wave pool and waiting about 15-20 minutes only for the wave pool to never come on and for the park to close.  Losing almost a full hour out of the 4 that night splash is open was a bit disappointing. Id probably still return.  But only because theres nothing better in the valley.
2	Cant remember the last time I was at a Hard Rock Cafe. This visit was only memorable for 1) Amanda Peacheys gorgeous face and voice 2) the jungle like humidity inside the place. Our servers were attentive. Our drinks were frequently refilled. But its just not as "hard rock" when its so family friendly. Its a very small space, and being in downtown Phoenix on a Saturday night in summer, it was sparsely populated as well.  Maybe Im missing the point, but overpriced drinks and signed guitars on the walls do not bang my shutters.
2	ALWAYS trying to upsell me on a number of services...high pressure too. I usually point out something that needs special attention (dog hair in the back seat, crumbs on the floor, etc) and they consistently proceed to do a half ass vacuum job. Two stars because the outside of the car usually looks nice and the inside is wiped down pretty well.. Overall, however, these guys need to step up their game. I used to bring my car here when it was under previous ownership and was always pleased with the service. Now I would prefer to drive 10-15 miles further to get a superior car wash.
4	Sports Chalet is the most complete sporting goods and outdoor store I have ever seen. They have a vast selection of sports equipment and exercise gear. Their Mountain Shop has a very good selection of climbing and camping gear. Although the gear section is not as extensive as REI, the prices are slightly better. And they do SCUBA.  I took my PADI course through a dive shop before I found out about Sports Chalets prices. They are FAR less expensive than any dive shop in the valley when it comes to the PADI open water certification courses and dives. The dive instructor at the Tempe store, Dan, leads the dive classes and is highly competent. (I give the dive program five stars).
4	Ordered the pork ramen and a rainbow roll. Both were great, sushi was like every other good sushi place and pork ramen was tasty and spicey. Good service from waiter but the hostesses werent able to keep up with everyone and forgot we were there and had us wait awhile. Other than that, experience was good and would come back.
5	Upon first look Pearl does not look like my type of place.  Trendy location/atmosphere often equals mediocre  food. Pearl is an exception to the rule. The sushi is creative and tasty and the drink specials rock. I love that they have different flavors for edamame, cheap bombers and did I mention the fish sticks are way to good. All of that would equal four stars in my book, fifth star is given to the staff. Steve is the type of bartender that others should aspire to be like. Knowledgeable and observant without being intrusive. Always goes the extra mile, I really appreciate how he makes my husband and I feel so comfortable. Overall great value and relaxed attitude.
2	It is ok Mexican food, not bad but is overpriced for what it is. I dont understand why this place is packed every night of the week.  The food does not warrant the crowds.  Im baffled.
3	One of the reviewers said this owner wants to run a restaurant - I completely agree.  That has good sides and bad of course in short it isnt Palette  ... We stopped in for brunch last Sunday - the French Toast is Challah [which I love] restaurant-baked I think - and seemingly not fully baked - the center was dough.  The scrambled eggs were adequate - the restaurant-made salsa verde was excellent; the Schreiners sausage as expected.  That was all we had - quality not a compelling reason to return ... until the service is factored in - crisp timely and friendly.  Ill be back to try dinner.
4	If you love pickles youll love Old Town whiskey. Weve been here twice so far, and both times, weve been very pleased.  So far, Ive only tried their pickled beets and pickled cherry tomatoes, but both were absolutely fantastic.  The Cherry Tomatoes were so sweet and sour, they paired perfectly with the ricotta, olive tapenade and Crustini they were served with.  This place is a gold mine if youre a whiskey drinker, my hottie loves some good whiskey and was really impressed with their selection... not to mention he said the burger was probably the best hed had.  I cant wait to get a taste of their Veggie burger, but I havent gone hungry enough yet... Next time for sure!  We went for Happy Hour this past Friday, and they had a lovely Agave Fizz cocktail on special, very refreshing.  Their Happy hour is progressive, meaning that everything is $5 from 5-6, $6 from 6-7, and it runs every day.
4	Zupas officially opens today! I was invited to their VIP catering event a few days ago and was able to get a sneak peek.  The soups are very good; I tasted all of them! My favorites are the wild mushroom it is very creamy and has a great flavor. The shrimp and sausage gumbo is very hearty with just a little New Orleans kick! I recommend them both! If you enjoy tomato soup theirs is a tomato basil and it is yummy!. One thing I really liked is that you can taste the soup before you order it! Bonus they have 8 varieties of soup to choose from! I had the turkey pesto artichoke panini as well it was very good. You can get a 7.99 combo of any 2 items soup, salad, sandwich. By the way its not 1/2 sizes with that combo either! I got a full panini and full soup. The soda bar is nice to you can create your own drinks! The ingredients are fresh and the employees are very friendly.  They also cater which is a big plus!
1	I am a huge fan of Chipotle but I will never come back to this location. The staff looks miserable and are SLOW. The cashier decided she would rather clean tables then ring people up so we waited for her to come back. Most of the tables were already clean so she could of waited to clean. The rice was crunchy like it wasnt cooked all the way and the steak was really chewy. Never again!
5	Dear Lo-Los why do you have to be so damn good!?  I really wish that when I had you last weekend you had been dry and tasteless so that I wouldnt have to come back and eat Fried Chicken and Waffles again... but now you have made me an addict to your delicious mouth-watering juicy breasts & thighs... Woah where is this going?! LOL Thank goodness you do takeout for now my husband will have to do his husbandly duty and pick me up a piece or two on his way home from work....  Truly wonderful... I never had waffles with fried chicken before and Im not sure why I was so surprised at how great this pairing would be but I was... Great service, everyone was friendly and upbeat and seemed to actually enjoy working there which is definitely a PLUS! ;-) I love you Lo-los!
5	Tweet tweet.  I decided to follow Market Bistro on Twitter just recently and am sure glad I did.  This company really knows how to treat their followers.  I have been a fan of Market Bistro for 2 years now, they have such a comfortable setting at both locations and the food is impeccable not to mention reasonably priced. I have always opted for the Market pizza, a dish that includes artichokes, large sundried tomatoes and a flat parmesean encrusted dough.  There hasnt been one time that Ive visited Market and felt disappointed in portion size or my order.  I have such an appreciation for an establishment that takes pride in their foods ingredients, atmosphere and customer service methods. As for salads,  If you can take the heat I would absolutely recommend the Arizona Salad.  The chipotle dressing, black beans, rice and tortilla crisps are a terrific blend of taste for your palette.  You will feel right at home here in the southwest with each and every bite. If you havent already started your car or phoned in your order at Market, Im 100% sure you are crazy. #BRAVO  (hashtagging seems appropriate here).
5	Dont let the slightly sketchy neighborhood put you off.  Baiz market has some of the best food in town.  The small deli (cafe?  Not sure what to call it) located in the market has all of the staples such as shwarma and falafel.  the prices are cheap, The service is snappy and friendly, and the food is exceptional, especially considering the price.  Wash down your meal with any one of many exotic drinks (or, just choose a diet coke) in the beverage cooler.  Even if youve stuffed yourself silly, wander on back to the bakery.  The assortment of traditional Middle Eastern sweets cant be matched anywhere in town.  Come early and wander around in the market to pick up your selection of hard to find ingredients.
4	My fiancee and I found this place on-line when we were looking fot sushi in the Central Phoenix area. Neither of us had heard of it but we decided to give it a go. We got there around 8:30 and the place was kindof empty so we were a little nervous. We walked in and were seated at a table by the window. We were seated with dinner menus but not a sushi menu. Ther server said they only give those out at the sushi bar. I thought that was a little wierd but the server was nice and the decor was hip and modern (it was metrosexual according to my fiancee) so we went with it.  We ordered lots and lots of sushi - ika salad, hamachi sashimi ($9), spicy tuna roll ($7), shrimp tempura roll ($7), and the sunshine roll ($11) (spicy salmon with lemon on top). We could not complain about anything! It was all very very good. It tasted fresh, yummy, and hit the spot. The total bill was $47.00 which sounded about right considering how much food we ordered!  We liked the decor, the service, and the food. I noticed they had a lunch menu so I will be taking my co-workers back with me next time!
4	I ate so many samples, I downsized my order! Some selections are a little too sweet for me, but others--giarduia, vanilla, pistachio, that dark chocolate stuff--are really good! We rode our bikes there at night. Made up for the calories. Youve gotta have a little wholesome, yummy sweetness in life now and then. OK, its not Andersons Frozen Custard, but its fine for Chandler.
4	Hubby and I have lived less than 5 miles from this place for over 20 years and never stopped in.  Looking for good Chinese so yelped the area and Dragon Palace popped up with good reviews.  Comments about the outside are right - little corner spot in dated strip mall but who cares if the food is good....and it was!  We ordered three lunches to try out different dishes.  Both of us loved the egg rolls along with the sweet n sour chicken and the house chicken.  Not as thrilled with the beef and brocolli - nothing special on that dish so will stick with the chicken next time....and there will be a next time!  Dont be fooled by the outside - step in and try the food - youll be back.
4	My croissant with ham, eggs & swiss this morning was fabulous & came with a bonus brownie (saved for later & was very yummy too!) & orange juice Please try the iced tea!! The way the owner makes it is amazing & like nothing Ive tried!  He mixes a kind of apple cider that they make on-site with fresh mint. Everything is made from scratch!  I love this and do not mind to wait a couple of minutes for beautifully personally made for me food! Even hummus is made from scratch from dried chickpeas. I was very pleased & my belly was full!
2	Great location.  Nice decor.  The food was adequate, but $13 for the turkey pastrami sandwich was a little high for a lunch.  I guess those chandeliers are expensive and rent at the Waterfront cannot be cheap.  Our server was poorly trained.  She placed the food in front of me instead of the lady first. I asked for water and the server brought only one glass of water and didnt bother to ask about the ladys needs.  This venue is not for those who appreciate fine or even appropriate service.  Sam needs to educate his young servers on the finer points of courtesy.  Our server was also extremely bored with her job, her life, and her existence.  Thats the impression we received.
1	U can go there n check the car out. If u wanna buy 1 there? Thats wrong move! If u even want a car service from there? U made a biggest mistake of ur life!! I had 1 time asked my girlfriend to take my car there for an oil service, guess what? They ripped my girlfriend off by lying how bad my car is now. If without fixing the problem. Might bring some serious accident. Then she did what they said. 4 brand new tires, timing belt, 4 new brake pads. U know whys the worst? All of those above I had just changed 2 months before!!! What a trashy dealer is that? People, better off go somewhere!
4	Being a total Asian bobaface in a generally boba-deficient state, I adore this joint.  The chocolate mint smoothie is always on my mind if Im in the Tempe area or passing through on my way north.  I dig my boba firm and chewy, so I always ask for the drink to be made extra icy to chill the little pelotas to ideal suppleness.  Eba has a pretty large menu and will gladly do flavor combinations.  They use the proper plastic seal on the tops of the cups so you can shake the living daylights out of the drink (as one should).   Also, Eba has free wi-fi and is close to the airport; its our favorite pre-flight stop to do a final check of email.
4	Byblos has some of the best Middle Eastern food Ive ever tasted. Their falafels and Tzatziki are delicious. And the restaurant serves up an amazing tomato cream soup which will have you lapping up every last bite. This is a great lunchtime destination.
4	LOVE LOVE LOVE riding my bike through here.  Especially on our way back, with all the down hills!!!!  Its like a roller coaster but better!!!! I also drive through here every morning to get to work, so that is a nice, relaxing, pretty way to start my day.
3	Ive been frequenting this Savers since the day it opened a few years back...  They have a great one dollar tag sale on Mondays which is pure bliss I tell you!! Having a tough week, head over to Savers with a 20 dollar bill on Monday and you will come out a new woman with a new wardrobe!!  My mother is the one who actually got me hooked on this deal lol.. The original frugality of the family lol.  Overall, I cannot give this thrift store five stars just because I am a thrift store whore and have visited about every thrift store in and around the Phoenix area and have plenty of experience with many other thrift stores.  This Savers requires a lot of digging, but some of my best finds have been a Dooney and Bourke gently used wallet for $16.00. Banana Republic black sling shoes for $5.99. Brand name NEW work out clothes and plenty of NEW with tags vintage dresses all under $9.99.  This Savers is okay for just cheap everyday wear, other than that you wont find many unique and extravagant pieces here. Also, for some reason, everyone that shops here is really nice and friendly, no competiveness at all :)
3	My biggest tip for newbies to YCs, look toward the grill and look up.  There you will find a nice little menu of sauce formulas.  Unfortunately, I never looked up.  As a result, I didnt have enough sauce.  In my case, that was a good thing because the sauce I did have tasted like crap, so more of the same would have been even crappier. As for the ingredients, lots of choices with fresh veggies.  I have to say the meat looked unappetizing to me.  In fact, I had to ask my husband what the hell it was.  I guess its a good thing you dont see piles of freshly sliced meat, else it might not be so fresh after all.  But in its frozen to minus 500 degrees F state, I found I opted for more veggies. Two sizes available.  I went with the large, crammed my bowl full until it resembled a small mountain, and then wasted over half of it.  So get the small unless you want leftovers or you havent eaten in several days.
1	They have some rude employees its unbelievable. Im trying to give business to them and ordered 6 smoothies and the cashier and her employee gave me a dirty look. Not customer friendly. At all.
1	I do enjoy a good bowl of Pho.   This was -not- a good bowl of pho. grey chicken meat., off tasting broth, old bean sprouts, 1 piece of a jalepeno pepper... dingy insides.  Weird looks from the server.  I dont think Ill be back.  Not much else I can say
5	This place has exceptional food and pretty great service for how busy it always is. I like it because there are quite a few vegetarian options.  Before I started my vegetarian kick the Baked wings were some of the best wings I have had anywhere. Try: - Mushroom Party Pizza - Roasted Corn Pizza - Baked Wings - Red Velvet Cake Only con is the parking is kinda crazy.
1	I always have customer service problems with Fedex.  How the heck did they get to be so big with the crappy way they treat customers?  I use the Internet a lot for purchases and about 60% of the time, they screwed-up and then their customer service has major difficulty fixing the problems.  I have asked for shipments to be held at the closet shipping location to my office and they ship to my home.  Another time I asked for the same thing and they held it at the regional depot instead of where I asked that it be sent.  I can go on and on about the screw-ups I have experienced with Fedex.   But this time they really pissed me off.  I get a harassing phone calls from a collection agency that says they have been contracted by Fedex to collect an overdue bill from me in the amount of $4000+.  I have asked them for details and all I get is harassment.  So I asked Fedex for help and customer service told me to contact Fedex Revenue Services, which I did.  I told them that I am getting harassing phone calls from XYZ collection agency and the person who keeps calling is named Chris.  I also tell them that the alleged amount owed is $4000+ and the account is supposedly in my name.  So I ask that they investigate and tell me if I indeed have an overdue account in my name for this amount.  (I know I do not have such an account!).  Fedex then tells me that they cannot help me because I have not provided enough information.  WTF?  How much more information can I provide?  Do they want my height and weight?  Maybe my blood type?  Maybe I have to provide the names and birth dates of my children too? This is why I say that Fedex really blows!
4	I didnt give this rating based on taste because I frankly hate Pizza Hut pizza. I think its gross. The sandwiches and wings are great though. My fiance loves it all though. I like it because it is right next to our house and the staff are always friendly. I pick it up on my way home and if I get there early they try to get it for me as soon as they can.
5	Did you know that Malees on Main offers cooking classes!?  They offer them twice a month during tourist season and once per month during the rest of the year.  I attended two weeks ago, and it was OUTSTANDING!  Not only did we learn to cook Thai (which, incidentally, it was significant to learn that Thai gets its flavor by layering is sauces), but we were given the recipes for some of the signature dishes, served tastings, a meal, and wine pairings, and we were even given goody bags.  It was a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon with another foodie!
3	Overall , I like this place. A smal hole-in-the-wall place with straight forward, cheap, non-greasy Mexican food. I can dig it. I personally think the one on 7th st is better, but I will chock it up to growing pains since this locations only been open for about a week. I went today for my all time favorite Torta, but they didnt grill my bread so it wasnt nearly as awesome as it usually is...yes, Im picky
5	Im going to be an uptight stickler here, and only review the pizzeria portion of LGO since the grocery part can be done under as a separate business. I hope others follow suit. Sorry, Im super nerdy about this stuff. Anyways, the sourdough crust is my favorite pizza crust in all the land. I love the flavor and how its always glistening with oil when it comes to the table. The toppings are really special here. If you even remotely like avocado, get their avocado pizza. The lemon zest puts it over the top. The corn with goat cheese is my next favorite. The only one that I havent liked is the the rocket man. It tasted fine, but the heavy toppings were too much for the thin crust. We also had the fortune of trying their grilled artichoke appetizer one evening. I couldnt get enough of it! Its not on the menu (seasonal item Im sure), but we asked about it when we saw plates of it go by. Extra bonus points for the large selection of cheap pizza wines. Any time I can get a decent bottle at a restaurant for under $20, Im a happy camper.
3	My wife and i stayed there for our anniversary and had a great time.  little dissappointed in the cottage we stayed in.  i know the place is old but you have to update and remodel every once in awhile (century).  I want to give 4 stars but i also think that the price was a little steep for a summer rate.  Now, i know that i should expect to pay alot for the biltmore but i am not the ritzy type of person.  I am sure my wife would give it 5 stars.
5	I LOVE this place. I have been craving their Baked Spaghetti Pie again for 5 years and I finally got it today since Im back for a business trip! I remember pretty much everything on their menu is fresh and delicious. Their prices are great too! Very polite staff.
1	I am *floored* that this place has 4 stars. Literally fell out of my chair, picked myself up, then continued on to write my review.  The staff is friendly at this restaurant - Ill give them that. Its relatively clean and has decent prices. Thats where any positives end. The food here is absolutely disgusting. Nothing has any flavour - no flavour at all. None. Nada. The salsa is peppery water at best, the beans are mush, and the rice just tastes like plain white rice. I had a ground beef burrito, which Id think would be difficult to mess up... Nope. Not for these guys. The beef itself was unseasoned burnt 80/20 ground beef. There was at least 3lbs of sour cream. And for Gods sake -- even the "cheese mixture" had zero flavour. Ive eaten better pizza boxes. Pass on this places, dudes.
4	Love this place. the atmosphere was rather chill and calm. We played Uno, and drank pretty darn good coffee! we had a lemon cookie, which was...JUST RIGHT!
3	Yard House seems to be a good place to meet a group of people because of their huge menu, beer selection, and atmosphere conducive to talking... this location can get crowded, so depending on when you go, be prepared to wait. Im typically not so much into chain restaurants but Ive been to Yard House more than a handful of times and its pretty consistent so I dont mind going every once in a while... the thing is, I now have a favorite item on the menu, its the miso glazed sea bass.  When we went the other night, they were out... bummer! Our server was fine- not the most friendly, but took decent care of us.  We were a party of 6, and I wasnt the only one planning on ordering the seabass... my aunt and I were both disappointed, but what can you do?  I ended up with the shrimp and vegetable terriyaki bowl and my aunt went with the tuna tartar appetizer and edamame.  Others at the table had the scallops, the turkey burger, a steak salad, and scallop entree... Few of us were drinking that night, but we managed to have a good meal. The manager, Clem, came over to apologize for being out of seabass - that was appropriate; obviously, we knew it wasnt his fault, but the gesture was nice.   In thinking about writing this review, I have to say that I lingered between 3 and 4 stars... I ended up giving just 3 because the Yard House has become just another chain restaurant in my eyes... nothing special, the same thing every time, just plain old average! Sure, Ill be back for group meals, but I wont be rushing over on my own or on a date anytime soon. Go for a beer, go to watch a game, go to listen to some classic rock and have an average meal... and if you like seabass and its in stock, go for it!
3	Hmm, a bit disappointed. I had been here several times when I used to live in Scottsdale, but that was 3+ years ago, and I must say that I think things have gone downhill here. The bruschetta toppings on the combination platter were odd for the most part, with the exception of the traditional fresh tomatoes and basil, which was delicious and worth mentioning. The provolone on the sausage bruschetta was excessive and the overall combination of flavors just didnt work. The pesto bruschetta was SUPER garlic-heavy, even for someone like me who loves garlic. I couldnt finish either of the latter types of bruschetta.  Onto the main course - pizza. Had the Toscana, which has mozzarella, tomato sauce, mushrooms, and sausage. The crust was burnt and flavorless and the toppings just seemed kind of bland and strangely old-tasting. I mean, not fresh. Weird, I know.  I sort of liked the red sangria, but it was a somewhat odd twist on sangria, as it was pretty sweet and not very strong.  I am sorry, Grazie. I am spoiled by having had the best pizza on earth in Chicago and am too excited to try the other acclaimed pizza joints in Phoenix/Scottsdale to return to your restaurant.
4	Judging by some of the reviews, maybe I went on good days because Ive enjoyed my trips.  Good food and good service.   The last time I went, I sat at the bar for lunch on a Sunday, ordered an All~Star Burger with BBQ sauce and enjoyed some sports.  The bartender was nice and the food came quick, which was good because I was hungry (I inhaled the burger). Ill be returning on a regular basis once football starts back up.
4	So as our last restaurant in Phoenix, I decided to visit Green, due to its great reviews and popularly. I got the Kung Po with mock beef, which was only $7, which is super cheap and really good. The restaurant is hidden in like a little corner, so its a little hard to find, but the interior is nice and beautiful. As a tip, just remember that you seat yourself and you have to get the menus at the counter. Took us a while to realized that. Overall, super cheap, really good and nice place.(:
4	This is my first review on yelp. My wife and I were looking for a place we could take the kids for ice-cream tonight after visiting bass pro shops. Did a search on yelp found this place. Ive got to say Ive never tried gelato before but my wife thought it looked good. I got peanut butter and banana, the wife got PB and choc Oreo, and my kids got Oreo and choc chip... As my 5 yr old said, this place is off the hook. We will definitely come back.
5	Great food.  Good service. Salsa is the best.  Enchiladas are very good.  I dont know what they put in the sauce, but damn is it good!  No better Mexican food anywhere in Scottsdale.
4	Ive been here quite a few times, and always love their food. Pretty good servings for the amount of money. Burger yesterday was a bit over-cooked, but the fries were great as always. I love how small it is - friendly staff and it always seems like the whole family is back there cooking and serving. Would definitely recommend.  So all in all, great for the money, and convenient because its close to my work, but I wouldnt drive across town for it.
5	I totally agree with L.C.s review.  Going to XCP made college seem like a breeze.  Yes, there were the typical high school dramatics, but I feel like the teachers were able to take a harder line on discipline, since they werent in fear of getting in hot water with the public school district.  I had an overall great experience here, and I love meeting people all over the country that have gone to Xavier.  My last flight home, the person in the seat next to me went there, and we had tons of people/things to chat about.  Its fun to see where everyone has ended up, and it is fun to get together with fellow alums for drinks here in Chicago, and when I am back home in AZ.  I think it is so sad that the girls dont get to do freshman swimming, sophomore dances, or go to dockers anymore - those were some defining moments of my XCP career.  I dont know much about other private schools cropping up in the growing valley, but if I had kids, they would be headed to Xavier and Brophy!
4	Little Chicago Pizza is the best thin-crust pizza I think Ive ever had. The restaurant is small, as they probably do most of their business carry-out or delivery.  We did eat in one time, and someone came right out from the kitchen to serve us, even filling our water cups from the soda fountain that was perfectly accessible for us to do ourselves.  Anywhere else Id have expected a snotty "the water is right there" rather than real service.  Everybody is very friendly, even when on the phone taking orders.  Price is comparable to any other pizza spot around, but the pizza itself, if you like thin-crust, is just awesome.  Add in the great service and you have a solid pizza place for the south Scottsdale area.
2	This review is for food-   On recommendation from the waitress my dinning partner ordered the nutter sandwich, I went for the grilled cheese and we started with the wings.  The wings were not what I expected nor wanted, the sauce killed it for me.  The grill cheese was just "okay" and the nutter sandwich that received raved ratings from our server was a huge let down.  We added the marshmallow and bacon (as recommend) but the marshmallow was no where to be found and the bacon with the natural (non sweet) peanut butter with super sweet jam was just.........not good. But! i do enjoy the space and the selection of beer.  I have had friends who have gone since and rather enjoyed their spam sliders.
5	20% off with a Yelp check in? SCORE!  They have very unique, colorful and patterned vintage clothing for sale. But what I liked most about this store is their vintage jewelry! Theres a local jeweler who makes rings out of old school buttons and brooches. I snatched up two really cute vintage rings.
3	3.5 stars. Went to the Calo Flamenco show this past Sunday, brilliantly talented company of dancers and musicians. The Center just completed a year-long renovation this May, completely refurbished all 1,500+ seats, added guardrails and orchestra level handicap-accessible seating, and enhanced their central A/C system.  The Chandler Symphony offers free concerts on monthly basis. The Centers programming schedule can be found here:  http://www.chandlercenter.org/performances.html
5	We came here for lunch and were a little leery when we first walked in. I had the cream of leek soup, my mother had the sausage salad, and my aunt had the Greek salad and we were all very impressed. We took a bangers and mash pasty to go, but we are so full, that itll be awhile before we can try it. The service was a little slow, but the quality of food and atmosphere made up for the inconvenience.
4	Somebody please tell me why QT is the best gas station/convenience store ever? The layout is the same for every one. The bathrooms are always less gross than other convenience stores. The service is always phenom. Gas is usually relatively cheaper than other stations in the area. Plus its like a one stop shop for emergency "got to have it now"s like snickers and chicharones and energy drinks and milk and wipies right? Hahaha! I dont know. My yelp told me to write a review... =D
5	I would order silvermine over Jimmy Johns ANY DAY! They have the best meatball sub....compared to Jimmy Johns it is GOLDEN (never mind the fact that JJs doesnt have hot subs...) They are always fast to deliver and the food is always great. My go to sandwich shop  **MUCH LOVE TO SM!*
4	Lo Los is pretty much what youd expect a place focusing on "Chicken & Waffles" to be. Small, lively, full of smiling people all eating, well......chicken and waffles. The line out front attests to its popularity.  After finishing the Phoenix 10K this morning, our group decided that Lo Los would be the perfect place to undo all of the health gains we had made. Little did I know that I would be undoing an entire years worth of morning jogs. It was the sort of experience that makes you wonder if you should consult a cardiologist.  We had a short wait for our table, but were able to quench our thirst on soft drinks, punch, and sweet tea. The staff was extremely friendly. Everyone who works here seems to love it.  I am a big fan of chicken. I am a big fan of waffles. Yet, I have never had them together. Thus, I decided the only choice for me was their No. 1 Meal, called KKs. Three (3!) pieces of fried chicken, 2 waffles, grits, and eggs w/ cheese and onions. I figured if I was going to eat at Lo Los, I was going to go for it.  The food came pretty quickly. The first thing that struck me were the two enormous globs of butter (1 in my grits and 1 on my waffles). In all my life, I have never knowingly eaten this much butter in a single sitting. That being said, it was divine. Everything was delicious and, while I am not a big "fried chicken" guy, I must say that all three pieces disappeared quickly. Other members of our group sampled the fried okra and the red beans & rice. I heard nothing but happy sounds as our table of 7 made approximately 15,000 calories disappear. This was followed by groans and calls for afternoon naps as we all piled into our cars to go home.  Lo Los is one of those experiences that should not be missed. But, make sure to clear your afternoon and, just to be safe, you may want to consult a health professional.
3	I like this quaint little restaurant although the space is a bit crowded - especially during peak times. Too bad all they really serve is Pizza (there are other things on the menu - but not much else). I thought the Pizza was OK - but certainly nothing to rave about. Desert was awesome -- they have a selection of crepes to choose from which are ALL to die for!  Bottom line: Experience is nice and unexpected for Phoenix. Food is not disappointing as long as you arent expecting a lot. Desert is special.
4	Still a fan. Im incredibly impressed one of the staff even remembered my name and my last purchase on a return visit.
1	Heres a thought, dont post on the door to your restaraunt "Up scale Mexican Food" unless you can prove it.  This was not upscale, it was barely pass-able  as decent.  Didnt help that the waitress got both of our orders wrong.  Will not return.
2	Atmosphere is like Im at a Mexican/Chinese/Jamaican restaurant..... cuisine could be better.
3	In a hurry in the Phoenix airport and saw Blue Burrito Grille. Ordered the Big Blue Burrito with pork. Unlike a previous reviewer, I got a LARGE burrito with plenty of fillings including some very tasty pork. The salsa was also very good. Their website says that the burritos come with chips and there was a huge bin of them on the counter but alas my burrito came sans chips... which I didnt notice until after I was on the airplane. A good place for a quick Mexican lunch but make sure you get the chips.
2	Uninspired. From the food to the staff, just another mediocre Chinese restaurant in the valley. I expected something better.
4	The first time was so good, we had to come back!  The Peach Creme Brulee pancakes wowed my partner both times... something totally addicting about the crunchy edges.  Their Daily Dose Hash is a delicious blend of sweet potatoes and onions, with so much more, making me wish I had the recipe.  The omelets are good, its just that I want them to be better, to the point where I have to have them again.  Both the Caprese omelet and the Bacon omelet tasted like the listed ingredients were put into the omelet.  That is different from making the combination of ingredients to a whole delicious oneness.   Im going to go for the French Toast next time.  The service the first time was a 10+ out of 10, with the 7am server being very friendly, very helpful and made the whole experience even better.  This past Weds morning, it was good, nice, perfect service and friendly... about a 9.  I really like this place and Im going to go back a few more times to find the best dish.
5	This store made me feel like I had died and went to fabric heaven.  There is just so much beautiful, wonderful, amazing fabric.  I dropped a pretty penny- but Ive already used some of my perfect fabric for great projects. The place is clean, the staff is super friendly and patient- especially with newbies like me.  When I brought 10 different reams of fabric up and had to stop and really think about how much I needed- patience came with a smile.  It seems like everything (even the high end designers) are around $10/yard. If you get bogged down with all the fabric that you are falling in love with, they have a cute little table set up with these funny little signs that say "get your paws off my fabric" which made me chuckle.  Maybe Im turning into an old lady who loves silly stuff like that. Despite the somewhat sketchy location, 35th Ave. Sew and Vac is my new go-to for fabric!
5	this place is so darn cute!  You might miss it if you are driving too fast.  The food is like nothing I have ever experienced.  I had the pot pie, mmmm was that tasty.  All of the chicken and veggies are wrapped up in a pie type crust with the gravy on the side for dipping.  I have never enjoyed a pot pie as much as this one.  The only thing that was slightly off, was the lighting is very dark and the portions are small.  With that said, the portions being small left us room for dessert.  The dessert was out of this world!  You cannot go wrong with any of their items on the menu! I will be back for lunch for sure, and will bring visitors to this location too!
5	After visiting family in Scottsdale last weekend, hubby and I spent 3 wonderful days at the Boulders Resort in Carefree. We arrived a little tired and stressed; we left tan, relaxed, and rejuvenated. The resort sprawls beneath the boulder formations, but you can walk all over on the paths that are well marked. Our room was spacious and clean, with his and hers sinks in the bathroom, shower, tub, king sized bed, and walk-in closet. We were located near the main lodge, and a brisk walk from El Pedregal and the Golden Door Spa. We made great use of the wonderful fitness center and took a few classes as well- yoga, bosu, and water fitness. We tried both pools during our stay, the spa pool and the main pool. We preferred the tranquility of the spa pool; food and drinks at both locations were exceptional. If you meet Madonna at either pool, ask her to make the "Madonna Special" for you. A very refreshing smoothie. During our stay we ate dinner twice at the Spotted Donkey Cantina at El Pedregal- fabulous margaritas shrimp tacos. Our last night we dined at Rustys Chop House at the golf club. It was a lovely meal on the terrace with a view of the golf course.  Every person we ran into was exceptionally friendly and genuine, making the trip even more enjoyable. I hope we return someday!
4	I came to this location in Tempe after visiting the Picazzos in Sedona.  I ordered the Puttanesca Pizza (no olives) with Garlic Butter Crust again because it really is THAT good!! I think the crust was even better this go round!  The Chocolate Chip Skillet with Coconut Vanilla Ice Cream is great and big enough to share!  We enjoyed sitting outside on the beautiful outdoor patio on such a beautiful day!
4	Very impressed by Shadys. Really enjoyed the atmosphere here. Reminds me of an old school neighborhood bar in Chicago. The bar has a good selection of beers. The bartenders can make a pretty good craft cocktail also. Theres no cocktail menu per se , just let the bartender know what youre interested in and let them take it from there. They show old school movies on their TV and have a pretty nice selection of music in the juke box. Definitely one of the better places I got to visit while in Phoenix.
4	Lunch review:   Great quick lunch options. Im a big fan of the lunch salads.  They are very filling (paired with the free chips and salsa!!)  My favorite is the Chipotle Chicken Salad (Mixed lettuce, black beans, roasted corn, cheese mix, pico de gallo topped with grilled chicken)-- its only $6.99.  The spunky chipotle dressing is delish.  There are also several lunch-sized versions of dinner plates available for diners looking for a heartier meal.  The service is always friendly and were are able to get in and out in less than an hour, which is very convenient during a busy work day.
3	Huge portions of delicious pulled pork, perfect coleslaw, ice cold drinks, plenty of TVs, and friendly staff make this a fun place you should try!  Ohhhh yeah, be sure to use the Yelp check in deal for a free desert!  We went with the Death by Chocolate!  It is built for two and ohhh so delicious!  However, I am only going with three stars due to limited BBQ meat selection compared to the others in town, limited cramped parking, and dirty paper menus.
4	Love the drive up waitstaff on skates experience! They have happy hour specials with deals on drinks. I recommend the Cherry Limeade, so good, like a Shirley temple with a kick of lemonade added in.
4	This place would have gotten 5 stars for the food, but I deducted for the decor. In my humble opinion you have as close to authentic as your going to get. The place is close to being considered a "DIVE" but hey, you dont eat the building and furnishings. I like the fact they give generous portions and you can buy their home made tortillas and other items in quantities to take home and prepare it to fool your guests....did I say that out loud? LOL.... when I was in Nursing school (not far from there) I ate there a lot...gain a ton, but enjoyed every delicious minute of it!
1	Slowest DRIVE THRU ever!!!! Also the quintessential SHORT BUS Location. I frequented this location around dinner time since it is the closest to my home a few times and every time it is between a 10-15 min ordeal. When i worked at Mickey Ds in the early 90s we had what was called 90 sec HBO( Hand Bag Out), from order to picking up should be no longer than 90 secs. This must not be a practiced any longer.  I have to say hello when I drive up to the speaker due to getting no response. Then I get someone who is rude and says yes. I order the big mac deal, buy 1, get 1 for a $1. The employee says they do not offer that, I advise their menu out front does. After 5 min of silence and cars backing up I pull fwd to make sure he is still living to see what is up. Total lack of cust serv service, he had to have the mgr show him how to ring it up, no apology or anything. This happened each time I went there. Cmon man
4	I enjoyed this place. It was a nice change of pace. Im really not into spicy food, but the food wasnt really spicy, although it had a nice kick to it. The place was a little small for my taste, but the food made up for it. The staff is very friendly and the prices were reasonable, compared to the huge servings of food.  I went with a group. I had a blood orange mojito, and we shared some of their chicken, cornbread, creamed corn, steak, prawns, and the chipotle mashed potatoes.
5	This is my go-to spot for mani-pedis and brow waxing. They do a bang-up job on my poor feet because it takes a lot to get those pups looking good. I have never made an appointment but never had to wait more that 3-5 minutes to be assigned a nail tech.  They recently got new massage chairs that dont grind your bones or shake you to death like some chairs do. Also, this is one of the best places I have been for a brow wax. My sensitive skin has taken a beating at many other places but never here. I dont know anyone by name but the employees are all very nice and skilled at what they do. Oh, and they are typically $5 cheaper than anywhere else I have been for pedicures!
5	My family and I ate here Saturday night.....based on the reviews of Yelp. We were not disappointed, as a matter of fact, we were pleasantly surprised with every aspect of our evening.  When you arrive at Bobby Qs, the outside makes it feel as if you are about to walk into a dive.  However when you turn the corner and walk in the door, that is not the case.  Very nice ambiance throughout the entire restaurant. They had wonderful mood lighting! I love low mood lighting!  Our server was very friendly and helpful.  Our meals were excellent.  My husband got the Chicken Fried Chicken and I got the Top Sirloin.  We started with the corn bread, which was delicious!  I dont care if it feel apart at least it wasnt dry!  My top sirloin was cooked a perfect Medium and seasoned exceptionally well.  I really loved it and I love steak.  Surprisingly the roasted corn was one of my favorites of the night, I dont usually gobble up corn when I get it with dinner, but man, this was some heavenly corn!  My husbands chicken fried chicken was perfect.  Pounded thin, with a light crispy batter, I hate to say it, but it might have been better than Texaz Grills chicken!  It was tasty.  My son got the oven cooked pepperoni pizza and it was a large portion for the $4.00 price tag, he even took some home.  Our food was excellent, there wasnt one thing we didnt like, the food was hot, the service was great, the atmosphere was great, we will return!
5	One of our Lexus car keys/key fob was cracked and needed to be replaced. Going to the dealer would be anywhere from $250-$400! I found Alcatraz on Yelp and called Todd. Todd did exactly what he said had to be done and the charge was $75.00. Todd is knowledgeable and knows what he is doing. Most other locksmiths couldnt do the job because they dont have the machine necessary to fabricate the key. I am a home inspector in the Phoenix metro area, and before I left with my new key, I took more than a few of Todds business cards that I plan to give to my clients, so that when they move into their new home, they can call someone who is reliable, knowledgeable and trustworthy to help with their home security.  Thanks, Yelp, as I found Alcatraz on your site.
3	Fat fries are good, but thats probably it. I had a turkey burger that didnt taste much better than something I could make in my microwave. I had "everything" but still could barely taste anything. 3 stars is because my brother had an L and it was really L. His also looked much better than mine did. All in all, it is better than most fast food, but really isnt worth it for the price you pay. Your wallet would thank you for hopping across the street to In n Out, and your tastebuds would thank you for driving several miles east to 5 guys.
5	So yummy!  I got the low calorie yogurt with all kinds of yummy fruit in it & didnt even feel guilty.  Such a fun place to go with friends or as a nice dessert after dinner. I cant wait to go again!
3	Wed wanted to try this place for a while. We went there for lunch and had a cheeseburger, fries, and coke. Everything is ala carte which makes it a little pricy (came to nearly $9). The burgers are OK, not bad, but not as big or as fantastic as Id hoped. The fries were really good though...extra crispy. The atmosphere is really relaxed and friendly. We had our 9 month old and there werent any high chairs that we could see, so it made it hard for us to eat (one had to hold her the whole time). Overall it was a nice place but not as great as Id expected. We will try it for breakfast though sometime because the ratings on that seem to be pretty good.
5	Pita Jungle can do NO WRONG in my eyes!  The food has always been amazing! I have been going here for 10 years or so and have never left displeased.  Also they are a home spun local business, which always makes me happy!  Yes, they do have hipper then thou hipster working there, but those hipsters can sure make a mean hummus!  I have many favorites which is starting to make it hard when I go there, because I want them all! Pita Jungles portions are always so generous that I have never even finished what I ordered.  My new fav is the Lentil Fetoosh Salad, the mix of the lentils and rice with the caramelized onions over the fresh mixed greens with that lemon vinaigrette is WHOA! Its incredibly filling, split it with 2 or 4 friends, seriously!  Another fav is off the starters section, but its so much food that I never finish! The lavosh pita crisp! Its like a fancy spicy supped up cheese crisp!  Thank You Pita Jungle for bringing bomb diggity food to the valley!
4	Bought a great pair of their eddie ballet flats here on sale...deal. This store gives good...customer service that is. They noticed my sunglass case was a little too old and gave me a new one of theirs...lovely. I returned a few weeks later during their friends and family night and purchase a different color of the same shoe...perfect for traveling and the lovely shaded purples ones will be a great pop of color with my comfy and neutral travel clothes! Hey if you see that girl walking by the Seine in Paris with the purple shoes...its me!
4	We keep coming back! I love this place. The food is always so good and even when I ask the kitchen for the naked cheeseburger, they make it pretty. And its delish and I love me a cheeseburger. This last time I ordered a vodka tonic and asked the bartender to surprise me - either Belvedere or Ketel. Back came the most frosty delicious Belvedere vodka tonic. Perf. The lovely, as prefers, mans up to the filet. And is always happy, sipping his pinot alongside..  I just wanted to say, yum. And well keep coming back. Thanks PCG.
4	I heard about this little gem earlier in the week, and after looking at the menu online and reading some reviews from fellow yelpers, I decided I would try it out. The restaurant was very clean and I enjoyed the music playing, but I think it could use a little more color in the dining room. I was greeted upon entering and was asked if I had been here before. The waiter was very friendly and took the time to explain some of the dishes to me. I asked about the pof pof and he explained that they are like donuts, but better. I passed on them. I ordered the jerk steak over jolof rice, a meat patty, and plantains. First came out the meat patty. The pastry tasted like cornmeal to me, and not flakey like I had hoped. The filling was quite good and just enough spice without going overboard. The steak was very tender and flavorful, with a little bit of heat. For the price, you get your moneys worth and Ill have enough left-overs for tomorrows lunch. Before leaving, the waiter gave me a complimentary pof pof, and in my opinion, it was better than a donut. Ill definitely be going there again. John H
3	I love this place! Great flavors, love the tiny gummy bear toppings. One thing I dont like is the inconsistent hours. One day theyll be open at 8, the next time they close at 7:30. When our yogurt craving hits, wed love to patronize Woodys, but never know if theyre going to be open. I tried over and over to call one night, and the phone was just constantly busy. A little frustrating! I do enjoy their yogurt, but with the weird hours, and so-so feel from the staff its hard to give them more than 3 stars.
1	The reviews were so good that my friend and I had to check it out. We were very disappointed this morning while trying to eat breakfast and swatting tons of flies!!! They were everywhere, on us, our food, the other customers - and this was inside.  The egg sandwiches were served on hamburger buns shaped like rolls - I could have went next door to get one just like it at McDonalds.  Not surprised people from Ahwatukee like this place, it looks nice but the food is so-so.
4	I am not a big beer drinker, so I cant attest to the many different options they have in that area, but I can tell you about their martinis. They have a huge menu of specialty martinis and other cocktails that are all pretty darn tasty if you ask me.  My friend really liked the chocolate something or other martini, I had a pear one that was delicious and another pal really enjoyed the pomegranate press. The food is pretty good or I was buzzed.  Or both.  We had the cheese pizza and an onion ring tower (both half-off for happy hour).  Which, by the way, truly is a tower of onion rings.  And then the waitress brought out a free piece of cheesecake for my birthday.  It was a great time had by all.  But the best thing about Yard House is the location.  Its right by Kona and Z Tejas and if you start right at 3pm, you can hit happy hour at each location and then take the free trolley to Giligins. Yes, I did this on Friday and it was TONS of fun. Try it.
5	Quality sushi, fun ambiance, and the chefs there are a blast to talk with. Definitely worth a visit.
5	I love this place, sure its kinda creepy and in the middle of an odd office complex but DAMN those donut holes chocolate cake not the glazed ones are good!  Not to mention the NINJA BOWLS!!  Good God get the Sizzling ninja, top that off with a fried egg, and pineapple, get healthy with some brown rice and white chicken and then DRENCH that bowl with NINJA SAUCE AND SRIRACHA (which comes standard btw) AMAZING! Dont waste your life away without having one of these ninja bowls at this donut shop, i never thought i would be able to say that statement with a straight face but i did!  And for those wondering they dont serve pirates (some will understand this fact)  Also if you come back a few times they might throw some free donut holes at YOUR FACE LIKE NINJA STARS!!  I joke they dont throw them but you may get some for free (really though)!
4	I saw their ad in the College Times and decided to check it out. Had a coupon for free earrings (little stud dice ones) and I lost it; they still gave them to me anyways since they knew I was legit :) Stormy the co-owner is really nice. Lots of cool bargains to choose from; some really nice stuff I had to pass up since I am on a budget :) I did in-store trading too and got around $24 worth of store credit, which I used all at once. Overall a fun hunt. Its also a small little place so not too hard to get lost. :)
2	OK after hearing about this restaurant from a friend I decided to take the family out. First I must say that living in the valley for over 30 years I still and always will be a Haji Baba fan in Tempe Az. for life!(yelp them) So, walk in and would agree that the ambiance was less than. Dinner tables were cheap and the table cloth was tacky. Oh almost forgot why is there a large mirror on the wall? Were given dinner menus by a impolite waitress who I suspected was surely going to be the owner. The first thing that hit was the prices! $$$ I kindly asked the waitress if I could just have a Gyro sandwich. The answer was NO! (rudely). Those are only available during lunch time! Ok, so next option was to gamble on a gyro plate priced at $14.95. We placed our order and waited. The food arrived on a timely manner. The food was hot and looked good. The tzatziki-sauce was a 10! Although the gyro meat was not to my tasting, it was ok for being real hungry. Eventually the waitress started warming up to us! :)  PROBABLY WONT RETURN AGAIN. Pros- Fresh food, Location Cons-Couldnt get what I really wanted.(A gyro sandwich) -$$$ pricey! $36 for 2 adults and 2 children. (2 gryo plates and a coke.) -No kids menu.  -Water tasted like it was from the tap. -Coke was flat.
4	Super fun!!! I havent been to this park in years so i definitely was overdue for a fun and wet time!!!  I went this past Saturday with my friend and although there were a lot of people there it was far from crowded! The longest line i had to wait in was for that toilet-bowl type slide.. (which was super scary for me, btw).  I would rate this place with 5 stars however, their food selection is very unhealthy and ridiculously expensive. My friend and i wanted to bring snacks (healthy sandwiches & water bottles) inside but our ticket voucher stated that food & drinks were prohibited, bummer.  Prior to heading to Sunsplash, we filled up on a super yummy & filling breakfast at Cracker & Co, conveniently located less than a mile from the waterpark! About 2 hours into our wet & wild time, we did take a break and treat ourselves to two large icees (for $8, nuts.. right?).. and before we left we had a scoop of ice cream each for $3.. each. Ha. As i was chowing down, i looked over to my friend and said, "we could buy a half gallon of ice cream for the price of this ONE scoop!" Sheesh.. whatever, it was worth it.. we supported our economy that day. Youre welcome Economy! Lol Over all, i had a blast acting like a dork & reliving my teens. There were tons of lifeguards on staff & they helped keep everything safe, organized, and everyone happy. I am planning on gathering more people, including my boyfriend to go THIS weekend too! We might try a different park though, just to keep things fresh! The wave pool, the lazy river, the variety of slides, the lily pad cross... Sunsplash is a SUMMER TIME MUST!
5	I totally love this place. It reminds me of the old school hardcore Chinese restaurant my parents used to take us when we were kids :D  The decor is amazing- unlike more Chinese places in Phoenix. The walls are a teal blue, adorned with large carved pieces of artwork depicting scenes in China, golden dragons and more. The lights hanging from the ceiling are amazingly ornate. The place looks like its from a bygone era (doesnt help that its in a run down strip mall) but it is clean and charming inside. The service was great- kind to our 2 yo, and very attentive. The food was the best part- I cant remember the last time I had such good Chinese food, and its priced very reasonably. We got the Peking dinner for 2 which included the fried noodles, hot tea, wonton soup (with generous noodles, meat, shrimp and veggies, the best Ive ever had), a pupu platter with eggrolls, bbq skewers, house wings and those cheese puff thingies (the presentation is pretty cool, too). Next came 3 entree sized plates of food: mongolian beef, fried chicken (cant remember the name) and the Peking fried rice. The meal concluded with incredible little desserts- sort of like eggrolls but filled with banana and then covered with crystalized honey. I could have eaten 100 of them! Adding in a beverage and tax, the meal was only $34!  My 2 yo can really eat, so I am surprised and pleased to say that even with sharing the dinner for 2 people with him, the 3 of us walked out with lots of leftovers. Highly recommended. Do it! DO IT!
5	I have been dining at this Indian restaurant for a few years now.  It was introduced to me by a close friend.  I have taken my co-workers, members of my ward, my mother and brothers and finally I get a chance to review it online. I dont mind going in for dinner, but the buffet is to die for.  Their consistency has never failed.  This place is great!
5	I took a cooking class with Chef Eddie Matney (Eddies House Restaurant) and his recipe called for Vanilla bean olive oil from the Olive Mill. First off, what he made with this recipe was phenomenal much thanks to that smooth vanilla olive oil in there! I decided to google this place only to find out that Chef Beau Macmillan acclaimed a the kalamata sandwich from there as his "bad boy favorite." I dont know what a bad boy favorite even means but it has to be good especially since Ive had his food and was quite impressed.  I decided to make the 45 minute drive from Scottsdale out there on a Sunday afternoon to get my olive oil and try this kalamata sandwich. Such a cool atmosphere inside. Its like a trader joes/gift shop/paradise bakery all with a rural, kinda on the farm feel. You could easily kill an hour here just looking around at all the stuff for sale.   I couldnt believe the kalamata sandwich! If you go there and order anything else....youre wrong. Freshest ingregients Ive ever tasted. I feel like the pork could have just been butchered 5 minutes prior to me ordering it and the vegetables just picked from their garden (which they do have there).  Pretty cool how you can sample the endless flavors of olive oil there. Got myself the vanilla bean and the blood orange as well. Make for some unstoppable pancakes.  Tried the gellato and wasnt all that impressed. But in all due fairness, Im not exactly sure what real gellato is supposed to taste like since all Ive had is gelleto spot and grateful spoon. Definitely worth the drive! Great place to bring the family.
1	I never got a chance to try the food because I was so turned off by the way I was treated. My family and I will be waiting for a table across the parking lot at The Cheesecake Factory.
2	Back from holiday and had some amazing soups that made me reflect back on my experience here.  I have to preface this review with that the owner here is quite lovely and Im sure has the best intentions, but unfortunately the soup was sorely lacking.  As a proponent of organics, I had my hopes way too high.  Well, first of all it was a bit confusing if we were to order at the counter from a very smudged, unreadable chalk board or if we were to be seated.  The owner appeared from the kitchen and said to have a seat eliminating our initial confusion.  To keep this review to the point, we ordered a smoothie, bland.  A frittata, very small and actually strange as if it might have been cooked in the microwave, need I say more.  Two bowls of soup, one was a bean with kale, unfortunately the beans were not thoroughly cooked and the flavor was not allowed to develop.  The other a red pepper concoction, that another diner suggested, was one dimensional and needed copious amounts of help sprinkled with some love.   When paying these boutique prices one expects and should get a better quality, culinary creation.  These soups needed proper development and herbal infusions that the kitchen obviously lacks.  I would like to offer a suggestion that may help her, so she can spend more time with the soup prep and less time running around the table up front, and that is to consider a different style of service.  The place is so small that she could have customers order from the chalkboard, if readable, and then deliver the orders.  I wish her the best in her endeavor.
1	The Management Group at this location need to make a better effort to control the number of people jumping theaters.  My experience at this theater was one of the worst that I have ever had.  I will never go back to that theater again.  I felt that it was nothing but a complete money grab.
5	Took Maddie here for a quick nail trim, was super impressed. Friendly staff, prompt service, and light on the wallet. What more could you want. My dog is with me always, so I wont need the boarding services, but will definitely make this my new pet vet! My co-workers have gone to the vaccination clinic they have where they were also impressed by the service and low price! Thumbs up for this place!
5	I LOVE this bar. My first visit was in 2004 when it was known as Bar Nun. Id just moved to AZ and I was drawn in by the neon green light and funny name. Little did I know it was the beginning of a love affair.  Since I didnt know anyone yet I went by myself and sat at the bar. The staff was friendly and so were the patrons. Some of the patrons turned out to be a little too friendly, and the bartender, Jennifer, insisted that the barback walk me to my car to ensure my safety. As if that wasnt enough to make a fan out of me, I found out they serve $2 Blue Moons all day Saturday and the food is awesome! The burgers are great, and you can order them rare if you like. I also became addicted to their BBQ chicken sandwich. And the wings. Theyll grill them instead of fry them for you which is a bonus. In fact I dont thing there is anything that I have tried and disliked here. Thursday-Sunday night they usually have a pretty decent cover band. Usually classic rock or 80s stuff. They also have NTN and a ton of TVs if youre into sports. I was so in love that when it came time to move from my apartment, I made sure my new house was within walking distance. Not that youd need to walk, (since half the year it is hot as hell even at 2am I can see why you wouldnt want to walk) they offer a free ride program on the weekends where theyll pick you up and drop you off. That way you dont have to worry about Sheriff Joe and wearing pink undies at Tent City. Wow, I kinda wanna move back now. CKs I miss you!!!
4	Where do I begin? I love Casey Moores! What a great ambiance! The outside patio is where its at, with tons of seating and misters. Lots of beautiful decorations to stare at while youre waiting for friends to arrive, and the staff as well as fellow patrons are always very friendly. When I feel like getting in touch with my hippie side I go to Casey Moores, because I can always expect to find someone outside painting a work of art, or photographing the wandering cats (yes, they have cats! theyre well-fed and happy).  It gets pretty busy after 5pm, but the good news is that if you arrive before 5 you can bring your pets and stay all night. I bring my dog in all the time, and she is always met with animal lovers who didnt know they could bring their pets.. so now you know! The oysters are good, but if youre eating them out on the patio the heat kind of kills that deal for you. I had never tried oysters before going to Caseys but they are surprisingly tasty and comparatively better than other oyster houses. If youre feeling pretty ballsy, go pee on the Blarney Stone! Every time I go there I wish I was a man so I could do it.
3	We have been to this location to buy gear prior to the Fiesta Bowl.  Yes, things are way overpriced, but that is the premium one pays for licensed merchandise.  One nice thing is that they had a buy one, get one half off deal.  Was nice for our large crew.  Nice selection of NFL, NBA and MLB gear.  Friendly staff, good location.  If you feel the need to buy licensed sports gear when you are in the area, worth the trip.
5	Excellent! I love this place!
4	great salads and burgers!
5	Love love love this place.  Great appetizers and cocktail menu.  Must visit in Old Town Scottsadale
4	I grew up at Word of Grace (now City of Grace). Way before the new buildings and it just the small little church. I love Pastor Gary. I would give him 5 stars. We moved but I had always considered this my home church. When we moved back to AZ I started again and was really disappointed with the young adults ministry and praise and worship. I left when I wasnt getting anything out of it and not much longer did they join with City Church. I think they are struggling but I have hope for them. Pastor Terry is the new head pastor and he has the Joel Osteen vibe, which isnt for me, but he is very nice.  They are non- denominational and love their congregation enough to handle sins or situations other churches dont want to touch in fear of being labeled as haters or what not. I hope that anyone who attends will understand their views do not come from hate. It makes me sad that the other reviewer had such a negative experience and I dont doubt that she wasnt treated with kindess as every church seems to have those rude people. I am not sure what she means by closed-minded but I know there are people like that at every church. I hope others do not have that experience and I hope the church can work on that as a whole. people need to feel welcome and accepted as they are.  They are also awesome with the community- homeless outreaches, drug addiction help, and so many things I cannot begin to list. If you ever want to help your community City of Grace would be a great place to get ideas of where/how you can help.   If pastor Terry isnt for you I would recommend Cornerstone Chandler(my home church) or Central Christian. They are not closed-minded but they also wont ignore sins that are major issues. IE divorce, porn, sex, sexuality, infedility, etc.  Good luck on finding your home church!!
4	Excellent selection of unusual but delicious pizzas.  my favorite so far include prosciutto pizza and the lamb pizza
5	A few weeks ago, I was receiving quotes to have my AC unit replaced due to the hail storm we had back in October. I had few companies come out but no one and I mean no one was as thorough as Dale with Mason Mechanical was. He spent 90 mins going over everything including climbing in the attic to check things out. He explained the differences between different units as well as what he and his team could do, which included taking out my furnace and installing a new ac/heat unit, pricing. etc. Fast forward 3 weeks later and I was able to get the appt set up to have my unit installed. Crystal set up everything for me  and she was fabulous, especially since I had to cancel the first time around due to my work schedule. (Thank you for your patience Crystal!!) Mike, the tech who was in charge of installing the new system called me promptly at 7am to let me know he was on his way and would be at my house within 30 mins. Fast forward 10 hours later and my new unit is installed. He explained everything to me including how to work my new programmable thermostat, made sure everything was in working order, sealed off the area in my now new closet (where the furnace was), made sure everything was cleaned up, and was just all around great. I am very happy that it was nice mild day here today because I dont know how they can do this in the summer. Thank you to the entire team at Mason Mechanical!
5	I really love this gym. It is so nice and well maintained. There is always plenty of towels to grab before a workout.  The childcare is excellent and has the security part down. When you sign up as a member you and your child are given assigned wristbands to use during visits. The staff have always been good about ensuring the numbers on them match prior to releasing my child to me. You can even tune into the cameras to watch your child on the tvs that are on the cardio equipment. Childcare is also open 7 days a week and doesnt close for lunch like most gyms. There is also plenty of group classes throughout the day if you are into Zumba or cycling,etc. I recommend this gym to anyone especially parents needing quality childcare.
4	This is a huge store and love that the clothes were sized.  There is a separate room for housewares and a bit messy.  Some of the housewares stuff was dirty but great deals. They were running a 50% sale on all items in the store, blue, red or white.  Own parking lot.
4	This place is wonderful! The service is amazing and food is delicious.  I especially enjoyed the Clams Oreganato appetizer.   The Eggplant Parm lunch special came with pasta and choice of soup or salad.  What a great deal!
2	On a early Saturday evening, the band was playing the crowd was just starting to meander in.  Going further inside in an attempt to avoid the high volume of the band whose audio was piped in throughout the restaurant (I failed) I realized shortly that I must of been missed siting in the middle of the dinning are as the wait staff moved smartly from the kitchen to the front delivering the drinks and food to the patrons. I ask a member of the staff was I sitting in the wrong area and soon service was rendered.   Food, nothing special but it is more of a bar than a restaurant.  Although the atmosphere was unique, I do have a question why cameras were in the mens room.
4	Great great great tacos! I go to a restaurant for the food first.  As long as it is clean, and Lulus is, then sitting in, what looks like a used McDonalds booth, doesnt bother me a bit.  Afterall, its a taco shop! I like the fish tacos (the small ones) and I usually order 3 of them.  I like how they are made and it reminds me of what you can normally find in Mexico, not at these chain restaurants. The Ceviche tostada is really good too, but is difficult to eat, so dont wear your sunday best. Not in the mood for fish, then try the carne asada tacos or any other kind for that matter. Lulus is a great place and a break from the Americanized Mexican Food, we see everyday. Enjoy it for what it is!
5	I have been going to Elite Nails for two years and they have always been wonderful!  People see my nails and always ask where I go.  I highly recommend.
5	By far my favorite restaurant in valley. Deliciously spicey. A bit pricey if youre picking and choosing items but theyre complete meals are a pretty good bang for the buck.  Not actually sure about the service as Ive only gotten takeout but if its any where close to the quality of food, then it must be awesome.
4	Cliff notes - Cheap: $1-2/plate - Fast: Its ready-to-go and on a conveyor - Acceptable quality: Im here weekly and havent gotten sick lol This place is definitely good for what it is, "it" being a budget-friendly sushi place thats great for a quick bite.  In a response to the lower-rating reviews stating how the food is just okay at best or authentic or blah blah blah, well think of it like wal-mart vs. *inserthighendretailerhere*.  This place has a business model based on selling in large volumes (hence the low prices like wal-mart) so theyre gonna have to "reduce costs" somehow (so-so quality food, not-so-attentive staff, and slightly smaller than average portions), but its still a solid bang-for-your-buck kinda place. On top of this, I can be in and out quickly since everything is already prepared, perfect for those quick 30 min lunch breaks.  All thats required is for you to grab it off the conveyor (depending on whether or not all the items you want are on the conveyor at the time).  Ive never had issues with seating, but do not make a point to go during peak hours and usually go with a small party (2-4 people). For those claiming to be "left to fend for themselves" due to an inattentive staff, most of your sushi-related inquiries can be answered by this thing called "the menu" that sits on the counters.  See, this miraculous piece of technology contains things referred to as "descriptions" on them that help to inform you about the sushi going round-and-round before you.  Furthermore, theres even a pricing guide based on the color code of the plates to assist you further! WOW! Lol wtf do people expect for $1-2 plates of sushi?  Someone to hold your hand? LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL DIAF And the cherry on top? $4 large japanese beers and $5 sake bombs! HELL YEAH!
5	YUM! I can never remember what it is, but order the salad thing on pita bread!  It will change your life!  My co-workers and I would always go in here and share one of those and then wed each get a slice of pizza.  Perfect amount of food- low prices- never too/disgustingly full.  Their bilinis are wonderful as well!
1	An upscale mexican restaurant in the area seemed like the best thing to have happened to me. I planned my visit for a quieter evening, and reviewed the menu again and again.  However, upon our arrival I thought twice immediately. The parking was iffy, and the place didnt seem to stand up to the signage. Perhaps the art was not to my liking, honestly not a piece stands out in my memory.  We were seated immediately.  Our waiter seemed a little off, not to mention the fact that he was insanely snobby and seemed to be moonlighting in the kitchen, where he disappeared for 10-15 minutes at a time. He did not fill our soft drinks once without being first flagged down (those of you who have experienced the close quarters will understand how ridiculous this is).  Halfway through waiting for our food (which took 45 minutes, easily), the lamp above our table went out. We sat in the dark for a good 5 minutes before they even noticed. Which was actually a nice change of scenery from the boring beige walls.  When the food finally arrived, we were too tired (due to having finished an entire bottle of wine) so we left. Unfortunately, we took our grub with us. I had some sort of mixed seafood entree with chorizo and a creamy sauce. Its no coincidence youre taken aback by the combination... it didnt go down too easily. Having dropped 90 dollars on the meal, though, we felt compelled to finish as much as we could stand.  Normally I would make sure I got the name of the dish right, but since I am recommending that you not go there, why bother?
2	You would think with the economy being what it is today, it would be easy for any establishment to hire semi-intelligent people to run the register.  I went into sprinkles to taste some of their fall specials and I walked into a scene that was beyond depressing. My first experience with Sprinkles is when I lived in LA. You couldnt get a cupcake without waiting in line at least 30 minutes. Scottsdale, you have 4 perky girls greeting you, with their cupcake themed baby tees the minute you walk through the door.  The trays were empty and the selection was bare at best. I ordered 4 cupcakes. NOT rocket science. 1-2-3-4  There was one other woman waiting for a large order, a couple dozen at least. The dingbat ringing us up tried to charge me over $80 for 4 cupcakes!! Whoa! "Are you sure those are mine?"  Her response was "is your name Susan?" No it is not. She gives me a blank look like she saw a ghost. So this is uncomfortable. I kindly nudged her by saying "I think my total should be in the $13 range, I only got 4 cupcakes. "  "The tag says you got 4 dozen." (i cant remember the exact qty)  Now Red Velvet (remember the themed shirts?) is testing my patience. Is that still Susans order?  Oh duh! Now we get it!  After all that I get the cupcakes home, and they are dryer than a popcorn fart. Disappointing.
3	Meh... I am surprised to read all the reviews about the clean store everyone else wrote about. In my experience, the toppings area looked like it had all merged to become one big nest. There were also speckles and swipes of fro-yo in all places imaginable... floor, counters, scale... And, I wanted to try a couple flavors, but there was no one around to help. Also, the checkout lady was soooooo dreary! With her monotone listlessness, she made me feel as depressed as Sylvia Plath! (just kidding, but she couldnt have been more doldrums if she tried) I usually go to Yogurtology at Town & Country mall (on Camelback just east of the 51). That place is always amazing... Pristine clean, neat, organized, always a peppy guy by the machines with little sampler cups, a guy who had one too many Red Bulls and is nearly throwing at least one sample of every single flavor at every single person who walks in the door, with a funny, witty little quip and a great personality and WAY too damn much energy. But its nice. THAT is what I had in mind when I discovered THIS place. I was excited. It was so much nearer to my house... great location (stupid layout though, prone to human traffic jams). I really, really want to like Yogurtland, but I just cant talk myself into it. The fro-yo was good (aside from the fact that I had trouble getting toppings without being too grossed out since it was a mess), but that was about it. All in all, theyre lucky I felt generous today and gave them 3 stars, because I really had to talk myself out of giving them only 2. -Jessica
4	I went to 2 Spring Training games at his stadium this year, and had 2 different experiences.  The first game we parked ourselves and passed several incompetent lot attendants just standing there.  As there were no barricades and they made no indication otherwise, we assumed it was ok to pull in.  It was only at this time that they waved their arms and said we had to park at the back of the lot.  This happened 3 times. The second trip we opted for the free shuttle from Zipps, This took the pain out of their incompetence out of the equation.  Once we got in the park we had a great time both trips.  There is ample shade covering a good portion of the seated area for afternoon games.  Beer prices were a little steep, but we were happy to pay $8 for a pitcher or 2 of Blue Moon at Zipps beforehand to take the sting out of the $8 cups at the field.   Of all the stadiums Ive visited in Phoenix, this one has been the best (aside from parking annoyances).  It will be a challenge to top this facility.
3	On my way to the Airport, I decided to stop at Teds for a bite to eat.  Being that I live really close to this place, and have never tried it before, I thought this would be a prime time to check this place out. Well, it was alright.  Nothing special on the interior, and even though I was not blown away by my experience here, I really did enjoy myself.  We waited in line, and I ordered a jumbo beef hot dog, with Chili.  Austin got a sausage, with some of the fixings, and fries.  We both liked it, and I plan on returning again soon.  Pretty good!
5	Best nights to go to Postinos are Mondays and Tuesdays.  They offer $20 deals where you get 4 slices of bruschetta out of the 12 that they offer and one whole bottle of the house wine.  Each bruschetta slice is probably the size of maybe your hand with your fingers outstretched -- if youre a petite girl  :) ...  They then cut each slice into 4s.  Perfect for sharing! We went on a Monday night after 8PM and ordered 2 bottles of wine, the 2 orders of the bruschetta (which were 8 slices for those that cant count), and a bowl of olives.  The total came out to about $50...thats a little over $13/person w/o tip!!  AWESOME!!    PLUS, they have complementary valet parking.  Everything was just fantastic, Ive never had fig before and they made my experience there quite memorable.  I definitely recommend you come in, regardless if its for their $20 deals on Mon/Tues or not.  Theyve got GREAT food and I WILL be back.
4	My mom and my son and I went to old town on a Thursday to check out some galleries and listen to some of the buskers! So after our perusing we stopped to get ice cream.  Real ice cream! Petersens is a really cool place and its brand new! Just opened 11/23 I think. Well they have lots of great flavors like Georgia Peach, NY Black Cherry, Cappuccino, Peppermint with real peppermint, lots of sorbet, lots of chocolate stuff that I didnt want to try, and old favs like cookie dough, butter pecan etc.  They also sell pints and also gallons I think!  The staff is super cool and well educated about the history of the shop. I think the girl said they originated in Chicago and that the tiles in the ceiling are from the original location! I just thought that was so cool! She also said that they could sub the milk in your lattes and coffe with ice cream to make pepperment lattes and more wild flavors! I thought that was pretty rad.  Anyway, if you are in old town I highly recomend you check this place out!
5	This is the best record store in Tempe, hands down.  Second best in the Valley (after Tracks in Wax).   I have been collecting records for almost 30 years now, and have been going to Eastside for about half that time - at least since I could conveniently drive out to the east valley, and regularly since I moved to this end of town about 10 years ago.  I remember the fish tank with the moray eel and the fact that the plaza they are in used to let them have twice the space. It amazes me that they have survived all this time.  And, boy, am I glad they have.  A good chunk of my collection, and even my current turntable, has come from here.   If I ever won the lottery, I would probably spend enough money in one day here to keep the place in business for another few decades.  Heck, Id even buy them a bigger place if I could!  This is one of the last truly independent record stores.  Im happy to support them, and I hope everyone else will continue to do so as well. Edit: They closed down on 12/31/10.  Im going to miss them.  Hopefully theyll reopen somewhere else, even if it is only online.  My regret is that I didnt have enough money to do one final run through there.
4	Im a fan of the bistro. Today, however, a seemingly customer was going behind the kitchen area, flipping my pizza and even entering the kitchen door. What? If you are an owner and are enjoying the bistro, act like a customer! I was kind of disturbed by a casual guy eating in the restaurant with his family and then going to get  cups, plates, and food from the serving area. Can I do that next time? I hope I go back. I have taken friends. As I said , I am a fan. You need my business.
5	I love this place! People are very friendly and very clean restaurant. I come here with co workers for lunch on a weekly basis. I order a gyro pita and side of Greek fries, so delicious! The salads are huge and tasty as well. The Greek fries are amazing with feta cheese and a lemon butter sauce they put over the fries. I can eat here everyday!
2	The rap on Starbucks is that they "over-roast" or "incinerate" their beans. And I think that might be right...sometimes at Starbucks, it seems like Im drinking something brewed from charcoal briquettes...it doesnt taste good:( Now, I will tell you that I am really no connoisseur of coffees...I like coffee, you know...a good dark roast, made with freshly roasted beans:) But the beans dont have to come from a specific plant , grown on the southern side of a special hill in Columbia and then eaten and pooped out by a badger of some sort. No, I just want a decent cup of coffee at a decent price:) Why cant Starbucks do that? I occasionally need to meet someone for business, and Starbucks comes up as meeting place (and I understand that...they are almost annoyingly ubiquitous:) I have sat at a cafe table on a street corner in San Francisco, having a cup of coffee at a Starbucks...looking at the Starbucks across the street...Lewis Black calls it "the place where space and time folds in on itself"...I say "why build the Hadron Super Collider to open a black hole?"...Starbucks did it a decade ago with a combination of charred coffee beans and vats of money to open a Starbucks for every adult in the United States:) In and of itself, thats no reason for a 2 star review...Gordon Gecko said it best..."Greed is Good!" and Starbucks exemplifies that credo...they are a generally very successful corporation grown up from the Bay area defectors from Peets Coffee...I have no problem with success:) No, my gripe with Starbucks is that they seem to be all about the marketing and not about the product...their coffee is crap:) So is most of the stuff they serve...its second or third rate, at best. And just because its convenient doesnt mean we all need to stop in. There is better coffee and better tea and better everything around...at much better prices...its worth looking for another meeting spot:)
5	We were craving Mexican food and since we were in the area I decided to check on my trusty yelp app on my phone to find a perfect food joint to check out.  Sure enough, it came through for us and told us about this little gem tucked away in an area I had been several times but had never noticed it before.  I am so very glad I tried it as it will now be my go-to place for Mexican food.  The food is delicious and fresh and reasonably priced.  The guacamole is a must try and the carne asada is so good.  If youre in the mood for Mexican and in the area, I would definitely recommend this place.
4	I have not had better chinese food since moving to Arizona.  The restaurant was 3/4 full on a Tuesday night!!!  With many Asian people.  I thought in this "recession" that having a restaurant that packed was a pretty amazing thing.  The service was superb.  The food was overall yummy.  I did not enjoy the greasy wonton chips that are served for free before the meal.  My friend really like them though?!?!  The hot tea was good.  My veggie dish (something with bamboo shoots, mushrooms, green pepper, broccoli, ect.) and steamed rice was good.  I ate every single bite.  The free dessert (wontons filled with banana and others with plum maybe?) were yummy.  The total bill with tax and tip for 2 entrees and 1 soda was $24.  I left full and happy.
5	being that im fully vietnamese and my mom has made all types vietnamese dishes ever since i was a kid, i have quite the tastebuds for authentic vietnamese food. also, growing up in so cal there are a lot more restaurants to choose from.  for arizona, this place is probably one of the best authentic vietnamese restaurants in town. i always get their pho ap chao....even the owner knows this when i step foot in the door. :) their pho is really great..the broth is good, the beef is good, the noodles are good. everything is like it should be. their spring rolls are pretty decent. what i really like is it doesnt pretend to be something its not. its a hole in the wall place, but most good and REAL vietnamese places are. the food is great and the service is quick.
2	Made the mistake of eating here on 10/24. Hostess and maitre de set the tone wrong with their completely haughty and unwelcoming approach when we arrived. Acted like they were doing us a big favor by letting us eat there.  Wine list is extensive but outrageously overpriced. We selected a good bottle (90 points WS) and when we asked the self-labeled "wine guy" about it, he said, "I actually can drink that." A snobby comment.  Food was completely uninspired and pedestrian. Nothing special here.  Service fair, pace was bad between courses - long waits.  Had a meal the night before at T Cooks -it was extremely better in every single category. Lons gets by on its nice patio setting. The food is average at best. Go to T Cooks instead. If you do go here, call long ahead and at least get a decent table on the patio.
5	I was Frost bitten when the first location opened in Tucson. Since 2008, I have tried numerous gelato places and none have come close to the creaminess, tastiness and overall authentic fare as Frost. Each dip of the spoon is reminiscent of my travels abroad in Italy with memories that bring a smile to my face and pleasure to my tongue.  The San Tan village location is 25 minutes away but the drive is worthwhile. The staff is friendly, helpful and armed with spoons for you to sample any flavor you wish. I went with the dark chocolate and salted caramel. Truly delightful! Word on the street is there are 3 locations to pop up around the Phoenix area. I think Tempe would be a great choice! Hint hint....
4	Friendly staff, clean restaurant, good food.  Our favourite - filet & chicken kabobs.  Patio seating with fans - great with a Blue Moon when the weather is nice.
5	Since moving to Arizona I have selected Frys as my new grocer and am very happy with my choice! I immediately signed up for their VIP card and love seeing the many savings listed on the receipt after every trip. I am especially happy that I have moved closer to this Frys as it is open 24 hours and even when shopping in the wee hours of the morning can expect to see some nocturnal ASU students. Any interactions I have had with the staff have been pleasant and enjoyable.
2	Not a fan.  I know this isnt supposed to be authentic Asian food but the dish I ordered (cant remember what it was called) was inedible.  The description of the entree I ordered gave no indication that it would be sweet in flavor.  Im not a huge fan of sweet entrees in the first place but this dish was sickeningly sweet.  I had to send it back.  The reasons why I give this place 2 stars is because of the nice ambiance, the service is good, and they were nice enough to swap out my entree for something a little more palatable.
1	in addition to sucking, its also expensive.
5	From the moment I walked into the lobby the staff displayed a level of professionalism that you dont get to see everyday. Each staff member that I came into contact with gave me a handshake and said, "Welcome to our business". I dont normally enjoy going to the dentist, but this has been the complete opposite. They made me feel very comfortable and confident that I was going to be happy with my experience, and I was!  So I set up an appointment for my 9 year old son on the way out. Since then we have both been in to have work done. My son need one filling and he took it very well, then trotted off to school like nothing ever happened. I started with a deep cleaning from Bobbie Lynn Tucker , RDH.  She was very nice and personable, did a wonderful job cleaning my teeth, not to mention gentle. I was never in any pain either during or after the procedure.  My following visit was with Dr. Brittian, DDS.  I needed a few fillings and I am very pleased with his work. Again gentle and quick.  My teeth look beautiful and feel wonderful. They were great with explaining all the costs and have cool perks like a Rewards Program.  I also liked the glass back wall that gives the patient a private calm view of the outdoors. The flat screens are cool too, but my only complaint is that when I asked quite seriously if they could change the channel, ( I dislike sport shows a lot) they were not going to budge. That might be something they want to work out. Other than that I really would recommend  them to everyone.
5	Always treat me well, very honest!!
4	So we have passed by this place many times.  Ive been into the Ace Hardware right next to it several times.  Dont know how we have never seen this place.  Fortunately we searched yelp for something new and gave it a shot.  The street tacos are awesome.  Looks like Ill have to go back for a carne asada burrito, but based on the size I saw (and what Ive read), its gonna have to be a one item meal!  Theyre huge!  I tried the street tacos to sample a few things...carnitas, pollo and pescado.  All excellent.  I would have to lean to the carnitas though.  Definately going back! Only reason it didnt get 5 stars is there was a kid sweeping and mopping the floor and we were having to get out of his was several times.  Just kinda rubbed me wrong. And while I loved the music, it was a bit loud and I dont know how much it was there for the ambience, the customers, or the staff.   Everything else about the staff was great.  Friendly and positive.  Mabe my next trip will kick it up to 5.....
3	I created a monster when I brought my family to Chipotle for the first time many years ago. I am constantly taking one for "the team" when I am dragged here by my wife and one of my sons.  I usually get the carnitas tacos with the salsa that has the little tomatoes, onions and cilantro. I even pony up an extra $1.80 for the guacamole. I just wish there was the option of adding tomatoes to your taco without the onions and cilantro. How can you eat a taco without tomatoes and guacamole?
3	I really didnt think this place was all that great.  None of the food that I ate was particularly very good.  I think the best thing I had were some sort of sweet and sour meatball things.  Everything was just hard, overcooked, or flavorless.  I wasnt really impressed with the options available either. The saving grace of this place is the BBQ station and the sushi bar.  The bbq looked 1000 times better than YCs Mongolian freeze-dried junk.  The sushi was decent too.  This place is just middle of the road for me.  I cant blame it for having over-cooked food...its a buffet.  But still, Ive had better.
2	I used to frequent this place when it was Long Wongs.  The food wasnt good back then but it was open 24/7 and always available. Since the change in ownership, I have been repeatedly disappointed.  The size of the menu has gone down drastically (which is understandable, Long Wongs menu was way too big).  They only serve slices of pizza at certain times of the day now (noonish until 3pm supposedly I think? and again some time in the evening) and you never know if they will actually have slices.  I understand that maybe they dont sell that many slices in the off hours, but I would gladly take a slice of pizza that was an hour or two old over none at all.  Not to mention even at 3pm it is not uncommon to get a pretty old slice anyways. The burgers are so-so.  Better than McDonalds, but just really not that good. Ive only had the cheesesteak once, and boy was it a disaster.  I bit into it and what must have been a full cup of liquid poured out of it.  Im not sure how this was possible, but it was almost like it was sabotaged.  Im sure this was a one-off problem and that they are not normally like that, but I was horrified and have not tried another. The owner is eager and you can tell he is really trying to make the business work.  However, the staff he hires can be very rude sometimes.  Ive heard some snotty tones of voice saying they had no slices when Ive tried to order a slice of pizza during the off hours and have been refused a simple refill of my soda when my order took far longer than expected.  That said, I have not been there in a few months so this may have changed.
3	Cherubini is a clean, comfortable coffee shop.  The employees are friendly, but  no more than every other coffee shop Ive been to. I had a decaf drip coffee, which was just o.k.  Nothing to complain about but not particularly noteworthy. I sampled 4 donuts...raised with maple, cherry iced cake, blueberry cake, and sugar raised.  The donuts were about average or a little higher.  Better than Dunkin but nowhere close to BoSa.  The cherry iced cake was the best, but all the donuts seemed a little too sweet.  Im a donut fanatic, so I dont mind sweet...but these, just a little too much. Kudos for keeping up a good appearance and free Wi-Fi, but I wont go out of my way to visit Cherubini again.
4	The food here was really good. I ordered the sesamie chicken and the sauce was very good. The service was marginal at best but it didnt annoy me. Id go back
5	Went here last night when on our last night staying at the Hotel Valley Ho.  We were able to walk there from the hotel and it was so cute.  The wait staff were helpful and gracious.  Once we saw how large the pizzas were, they accomodated us and split the toppings on each side of the pizza so we got what we wanted.  I did think the olives were really salty, but thats that type of olive.  We had delicious wine and the bruschetta sampler.  Enjoy people!
5	I freakin love this place. My favorite thing is to sit and eat facing the counter and watch new people come in and get all confused. Now thats just funny. My first time I was the same way, like what the hell do I do here. Now Im a pro. Stack it deep and use another bowl for smashing, Soba noodles piled so high it looks like a circus act getting the bowl to the cook. Mmmm....good.
1	Okay, did I say bad?? WORSE. Negative five stars. From San Diego, 1. they made us wait in line for ticketing. 2. Made us go check our bags 3. Bag agent told us the flight has been delayed 35 min and we have to wait in the "special needs" line bc we were gonna miss our connection flight.  4. Booked another flight. Meanwhile got barked at my a brainless, incompetent, mean lady that was a complete b*tch to us. She told us there was plenty of time for our next flight and that we should patiently stand in line (and miss that flight). 5. Got on the runway. Plane circled around for about an hour. didnt take off. 6. "mechanical problems". 7. kept ppl on the plane for another hour. 8. kicked everybody off saying we werent taking off on this plane. 9. made everybody wait in a long@$$ line that didnt move while we saw a ticketing agent to rebook our flight (while I held up a DELTA SUCKS sign made with pen and crayon on my sketchbook) 10. hours later after not knowing what to do with us, they placed us in a hotel in downtown SD. 11. We were to take an 8 PM flight the next day to LAX and then 2 hr and 45 min layover. 12. 11:45 PM plane from LAX to Tokyo.... scheduled 4 AM landing in the far east, you kidding me?  13. THEY LOST MY LUGGAGE.  ~~*~*~*~*~*~*~* another incident: LAX to Tokyo: "mechanical problems" stayed another hour on the plane. Had them shuttle us to a hotel in the middle of nowhere. Lost luggage on the way there. It fell out of a bus! Next morning, 8 AM plane to Busan, Korea. Seriously, you expect me to go to work on Monday after all this sh*t?! Sorry Delta, Im so exhausted, sick and tired of you. F*CK YOU guys and your incompetence and sh*tty customer service  too.
4	This place has had awesome bread since day one. Whatever else you walk out with is just a bonus. Actually, I have to say that the produce selection is getting noticeably better each time I walk in. I still dont think its quite suitable for everyday shopping, but its coming along pretty well.
5	This review is for the food only.  If you care about parking and what kind of extras they sell that arent food related youll have to check out another review. I love LGO.  The food is absolutely top notch and I love how the menu has both traditional fare and a few things youve never heard of like their Venice Beach Burrito which is filled with scrambled eggs, tofu chorizo, spinach, and other goodies.  It comes with a side of salsa which also fantastic.  I eat breakfast here all the time and I have never been disappointed.  Also, if youre in a hurry grab one of their pre-made granola/yogurt/fruit parfaits, Yum!
4	Amazing tour with a guide that was very knowledgeable and entertaining. The prize of the 90 Minute tour was a bit steep but well worth it after the fact. I will be back for the shelter tour.
4	you will wait... ALWAYS... I COULD EAT A POUND OF THEIR HASH BROWNS. i get them to go!
2	This review is based strictly on their burgers.  Why? I had just downloaded the Yelp mobile app and Harlows was among the top burger search results for Tempe. I know its a great breakfast/sandwich/diner type place, but had never thought of it as a burger destination, until the Yelp mobile results.  So I headed on over.  Heres what I found: Its not a burger destination.    They offer 5 or so, starting with a basic burger, then different variations based on toppings... green chile, texas chile, bacon focused, etc.  I kept with the basic, plus cheese.  For $8 you get the basic burger with fries, and the variations bump it another dollar or two.  Drinks are extra.   The menu said theirs were char grilled, but I think they are steam table cooked - no char or smokey taste on mine.  Likewise, I appreciate the regular menu featuring a lot of local product sources,  but Id guess these are from a frozen patty national vendor.  It wasnt bad, but it reminded me of many tailgates where we bought the big pack of frozen patties and simply reheated and cooked them on a grill. The service was good and fast.  The fries were decent, though nothing unique (also from a frozen bag?).  The bun was ok, and it came with pickle, onion and lettuce.  But its still unclear if they made them there or used an external source for the patty.   Bottom line:  After tip, I paid $12 for a burger, fires and coke.  There was no "wow moment."  If they produced something unique it might be worth it.  As it stands, Id definitely recommend the place for other things, but not burgers. Its not their forte.
5	My husband and I drove from LA to Scottsdale and almost to Scottsdale, one of our tires was going flat.  We went to Discount Tire on Shea and they checked it and found it was a cracked wheel (the tires are new).  They helped us get a new tire shipped from the east coast and put it on first thing the next morning.  They were nice, helpful, honest and affordable.  Absolutely great service!  I highly recommend them.
5	A few years ago my husband bought me a gift certificate for this spa. Oh my god - it was the most beautiful spa I had ever went to! I had a facial and a massage. In addition to that - I got unlimited day usage of their spa stuff! They had a beautiful locker room that had a sauna and jacuzzi in it. An secluded area where you could lay outside - naked! They also had a huge pool out behind the spa where you could just layout and be lazy. Oh- also they had some sitting rooms with magazines, fire places -oh my goodness. It was awesome! AND - the prices werent that high compared to other spas in the valley. Check it out if you can!
2	Maybe it was an off night - it happens to the best of us.  Ive hung out at AZ88 before several times, but on the night I plan to review the place they were so off.  AZ88 Buffalo CK Sandwich -- Ill eat one or two buffalo CK wing, but to make it a sandwich, I cant recommend.  Too much sauce! Also, make sure you chew fast because after a while the buns begin to go soggy - umm mushy bread with CK cover in buffalo sauce.... (Toast the CK itll dry some of sauce and give a crispier texture)  Service was off too!  I had 1 beer and 2 waters -- thats all.  If you know me I like a few bottles and at least a jug of water with my meal :) - I know I cant get enough H2O!  I understand the place is popping, but after being seated, there was almost no direction for the wait staff.  Ambience is always cool and love the layout and the feel of the place.  Better luck next time! - Enjoy!
5	I have found my new favorite breaksfast/lunch spot! I love the much cozier and homey feel this place has as opposed to chains like Panera and Corner Bakery. We stopped in at Wildflower Bread Company over the weekend because I had heard great reviews about their freshly baked loaves of bread. We were just going to pick up a couple specialty loaves since we needed bread at home anyhow. Instead, we ended up staying for lunch after we got a peek at the menu and the dessert case.  My fiance ordered the salmon alfredo and he loved it. This said a lot to me because hes normally not a pasta person. The salmon itself was really good - soft and flavorful. I had the butternut squash ravioli - one of my all time favorite pastas - and WBCs version did not disappoint. I loved the nutmeg flavor it had - perfect complement to the creamy sauce and the butternut squash. Both dishes came with big slices of grilled toast. The pasta portion sizes itself were perfect. Just the right amount to feel satisfyingly full but not overly stuffed like the portion sizes at Cheesecake Factory or Macaroni Grill. We ended our meal by splitting a lemon bar which also was devoured down to the last crumb. It was a later lunch for us (around 3pm) so it wasnt crowded inside but there were still a good amount of customers so it seems to be a favorite. Service was pleasant and fast and the menu has a wide variety of items that were excited to go back and try more.
3	Just great! The gluten free pizza crust is really good. Be sure to order it crispy otherwise it can be kinda chewy (unless you like chewy, then order it however you want). I really dig the BBQ Chicken pizza but I think that they might have recently changed the sauce or something. Its tasted different to me the last time I went. If they havent changed the sauce, then I *COULD* be loosing my mind. Either way, it didnt taste as good this time around. Just saying
5	We just tried this out this afternoon following lunch at Pita Jungle next door.   Its a self-service yogurt shop where you pay by the ounce once youve finished your creation.   The offerings included the standard vanilla and chocolate, but also less traditional offerings like Irish Mint and Red Velvet were also available.  They offer a taste of any of the products, and you can mix multiple types of yogurts in your container.  They also offer a variety of standard yogurt shop toppings for your creation. I had a combination of the Irish Mint and Latte yogurts, with a couple of toppings.  The yogurt itself was smooth, creamy and well flavored. Well likely be dropping by here in the future.
5	I have now visited Herb n Flavors several times. I love supporting local businesses who have sustainable practices. This place uses local farms for their produce, safe from GMOs and pesticides. So, I was already a fan before I walked in! Everything I have tried has been delicious, and the owner is such a cool guy- always so friendly to the customers. The food always tastes so fresh, and full of flavor! They have a little something for everyone. I am a gluten free vegan and my husband has no dietary restrictions. We always both leave happy. I definitely recommend this place. I would like to see their business continue to grow and stick around for a long time! :)
5	Ok, so I know that this private shooting club has had its share of problems with membership and maintenance issues but I have to say, in the last 6 months, under the direction of a semi-new board of directors, the range facilities have been greatly improved.  The members can enjoy shooting pistols or rifles pretty much all day every day uninterupted except when a scheduled match is on the club calendar located at www.phoenixrodandgun. This new fully updated calendar is really cutting down on the number of scheduling conflicts between match directors and members. Also, since aquiring new Range Staff, the number of complaints about other members or range employees has gone way down. I do have to say, the range which is located right in central phoenix is affordable, practical and overall a great shooting experience.
4	I really like this place. I spent 2 years in Honolulu and used to eat at this great little place in China Town. I have been craving that food since I got off the plane to move back to Phoenix. Well, I found China Chili and I am SO glad I did! The Honey Walnut Prawns are so  yummy! The fried rice and lo-mein noodles are smoky tasting, and hot out of the wok. Is it healthy? Maybe not. Is it non-greasy? Um... not really. Is it delicious when youre craving some really filling Chinese food? Yes. I wish it were closer to my place so I could have it more often, but Im sure Im sparing my waistline of more issues!
1	Warning: Douche Bag level CODE RED! Heres how my experience went ...  Me: "May I have a Carmel Latte?"  Employee: "No" .... dead air ... Me: "Ummm why not?" Employee: "We dont have carmel" Me: "Ummm I guess Ill just have a Cappuccino then" Employee: "Just so you know its a REAL Cappuccino" Me: "Okay" (in my head Im trying to figure out if I can legally punch this dickhead in the face or not). So I sat down mulling over this experience in the dank dark atmosphere while listening to this ass wipe talk to his friend about living on other peoples couches for the past few months and about how hell be moving to downtown Phoenix soon. To which I just chuckled to myself as this person was FAR from cool enough to blend into CenPho. What a complete and utter douche bag. Stay in Tempe poser (and keep your employer there to!). This experience was months ago, and now they have opened up a shop downtown. Guess what? Im not going to check them out. Fuck you Cartel. Youll never be Lux, so just stay in Tempe where you can be a complete poser with an attitude that you havent earned. Complete FAIL.  For my two cents, skip this place and go to Lux in CenPho/Mid Town right off the Light Rail. Authentically cool with ZERO attitude, great coffee and no douche bag employees.  And as for great coffee ... try Conspire WAY better coffee and authenticly cool. ----  please read "owners comment" below ... heres my response ...  ---- Wow so the coffee snobbery continues with the owner ... I guess my new job  should be to "promote good coffee in Arizona" ... and I dont appreciate good coffee because I enjoy the combination of caramel AND coffee ...  By that definition I guess I dont know good ice cream because I like hot fudge on it or good pizza because I enjoy pepperoni AND cheese or good music if its not acoustic or a good voice unless its A cappella ... thanks for proving my point. I wouldnt go here unless you are a total coffee snob ... (I guess) they dont need your business you poser!
5	I went to Z Tejas with a bunch of people (about 25) last night.  We had a great experience from start to finish.   At the beginning my lady and I were early so the waiter got us our drinks and continued to make sure we were good to go.  We wanted to wait for our friends so food wasnt necessary at this time, but the drinks were flowing and the waiter (Jeff) was very cool, friendly, and down to earth.   All of our friends showed up and we let the good times roll.  Chips and salsa, drinks, water, and the delicious cornbread, they all came very fast and it didnt take any begging on our part.   I got a chicken dish which was really good, I stuffed myself silly.  My lady got a side salad which was huge, she couldnt even finish it and she said it was really good.  Oh! and the food came fast by the way (surprising when you have 25 people. The overall vibe of the place is really cool, very trendy and fancy but reasonable prices.  Big screens everywhere, gotta love that since there were some great College FB games on last night.   Great experience, thanks Jeff & Z Tejas.
3	The beer list here is GREAT. Seriously. If you like craft brews, go here. The food is meh. There are a lot of really interesting combinations, but the execution wasnt the best. The service is also meh. All 8 of us had to be wary when our waitress came around to tell her that so and so needed something too. She would take one or two orders at a time.  Seriously though, the beer is awesome.
5	Great Mom/Pop store! Weve stopped by several times for some fresh produce and to get treats for the kids. We usually sit outside on one of tha picnic tables to eat gelato, while the kids love playing/petting all the animals. Thanks!
5	Fuego Bistro has quickly become one of my wife and Is favorite restaurants!  We went with a large group the first time and they were great about us having 7, including two smaller children.  Last night my wife and I went back for a date night and had the most wonderful time!  Jeff, the owner, is fantastic and always wants to make sure you have a great time.  The sommelier was also great.  He talked to us about the wine, gave us some tips for pairings, and even had us take a sip of wine while chewing our food.  It totally changed the character of both the wine and food. Speaking of the food, the short ribs are amazing!  The best sides weve had are the creamed corn and the chipotle mashed potatoes, but the maple chili carrots and the cornbread green chili casserole are also very good! The cocktails are great and the happy hour menu is pretty reasonable. We will definitely be going to Fuego on a regular basis!!
3	Chino is a cool place to take someone who has never been there before.  Its strange and fascinating.  I live fairly close by and the food is fine, but it certainly doesnt blow your mind.  Its the kind of place that I get that Chino craving then I dont need to go for another 6 months or a year.  The snickerdoodles are great and come with the meal.  Expect to pay close to $10 a person if you get a drink with your meal.
3	5 stars if you are rich and love to throw your wad around 1 star if you are on a budget and think plastic surgery is terrifying 3 stars if you enjoy window shopping, gawking at the snobbery and mock the fact that some people will spend $3000 on a ugly brown canvas purse with little "LVs" printed on it because it makes you feel good about yourself. 4 stars if you go during a mega-sale weekend when the "normal mall chain stores" have clearance - (Bath and Body Works, Gap, Express, Dillards etc, but they also have an H&M) All in all, SFS is a sight to see for the good and for the bad. At the end of the day it makes me want to escape to hills where people put value on the important things in life and not what brand your sunglasses are.
4	Avanti! Come in! This place is cool, I did get a mild mobster vibe, but thats alright with me.  And I think the food is fantastico. Really, really good homemade pastas and an extensive wine list filled with great choices. If youre uncertain which wine would go best with your meal, dont hesitate to ask because the servers are pretty friendly and knowledgeable.  Try the crab and shrimp cakes for an appetizer and the tortellini portifino for dinner- both are delish. If youre a dessert lover, get either the cream brulee or the tiramisu.
3	Gallo Blanco Cafe has amazing food, however the service needs a lot of help.  My first visit was one of the worst customer service nightmares Ive ever had dining out.  My second visit was much better, however I think our waiter must have been high on drugs.  During my second visit my friend and I ordered the fried manchego cheese appetizer and it arrived after our main entree.  Really???  I wish this place would get its act together.  Im very fearful in recommending Gallo to my friends and clients.  Ive vowed to give Gallo one more shot and if its not at least a good experience, I wont be back.  I work too hard for my money to throw it away in an establishment I dont believe in.
4	This is my favorite breakfast/brunch spot. Fresh bagels and different types of cream cheese. They even have Bagel Thins for those who are cutting their carbs.  You dont pay the person who took you order, but move down the line to pay for your food. Their iced coffee are a great deal!! Its a 20oz cup for less than $3!
5	I have been here many times, pretty much cant go wrong here. prices are good service is prompt and friendly.
5	Gallo Blanco has the most delicious ceviche Ive ever tasted in AZ. Portion size is plentiful and the chips are quality. I love the indie music selection it really adds to the vibe of Gallo Blanco. If Im in the area I make it a point to visit.
4	I love the feel of this cute restaurant! It was a beautiful day and we decided to sit outside. Their service was very fast and the staff was very attentive. It was lunch time so I expected them to be kind of slow but it was the total opposite. We had the ceviche for an appetizer and it was quite tasty. Also the chips and salsas are so good! I love how spicy their red salsa was! I had the chilaquiles with over medium eggs. Apparently it had pieces of shredded chicken and cheese. It wasnt your traditional chilaquiles but their own spin on the dish witch totally worked! My friend got the narco torta and he said that the egg was too over powering so he just simply took it off his next half lol Overall, I had a good experience and will definitely come again.
4	Dumplings, Chicken fried steak with gravy. What more can you ask for. The satff was friendly and fast, Cant wait to try it again.
2	I had dinner  there last night.. I had never been. Service is great, atmosphere hip. Complimentary valet..(you cant park anywhere in the neighborhood). I ordered the Blood Orange Bellini and it was not your typical bellini..not frozen and frothy. It was champagne in a flute with a sugarcube dropped in. Still good, but not what one would expect..just an FYI. I had the Caprese salad and the Mozz was not served "classically". Cold and sliced in rounds or in balls. It looked like marshmallow fluff and was kind of tangy. I was almost sure I was eating something that may have gone bad. I do not recommend to any Caprese lovers. However, the Organic Chicken with pan seared gnocchi was fantastic. Granted i asked them to add some spice for fear it might be bland.. Spiced it was perfect and Im glad because it probably would have been a bit too bland for me. My dinner date had their signature Pappardelle and that was excellent as well, although a bit soupy which made it messy. Olive oil cake we had to try and I can assure you it does NOT taste like Olive Oil in case you are wondering. Its like a lemony bread pudding but not quite as moist as bread pudding. Delicious. All in all great neighborhood spot but not too much of a variety to eat there repeatedly if you like to try different things, which is my style. Too many restaurants in Phoenix to return only to eat the same item over and over.
1	The bill was 150.00 and that was after a free appetizer coupon they sent me via email.  The food was no where near worth the HIGH price!  The service was not up to par either.  I really cant believe people pay such high prices for food that come with NO sides, etc.  I got iced tea to drink and it cost a whopping $6.00.  Thats right folks....6.00 for a glass of tea.  What is that 100% profit/mark up?  I paid 12.00 for a soup sampler.  Each of the three soups were in a tiny espresso cup.  My salmon was no better than what I get at Texas roadhouse but it was three times the price.  I would definitely not recommended this place.  If you want a fancy, awesome meal go to Houstons!  The one thing that was great were the rolls (they were free too)!  Dont get me wrong the food is good but not worth the price tag!  You can get just as good food a lot of other places for a lot cheaper!
3	When in the mood for bagels I go to Einsteins with my several year old yellow Einstein Brothers stainless coffee mug.  I pick up an AZ Republic and order a toasted good grains bagel with garden veggie.  I usually have the bagel in a basket by the time I get to check out or at worst when I am filling the coffee mug.  The coffee is mellower than my usual Starbucks but compliments the bagel.  Einsteins draws both the young and mature and I enjoy the ability to read the paper at my leisure either inside or outside in the morning shade.
5	Fabulous! Great views (obviously) of the city. Very romantic. Amazing wine list. Superb service. Delicious menu.  Luis was our server - great guy full of very helpful information (especially wine pairings). LOVE the lobster bisque (Im usually not a fan of lobster or bisque). Amazing flavor combinations in everything we tried. I also love ending my meal with a perfect vanilla bean creme brulee.  Highly recommend if youre bringing a newbie to Phoenix or if youd like a romantic night out.
2	Ive always been a fan of the Dilly Bird, its just a delicious sandwich... I cant speak for all locations but the one in Mesa off of Southern was a real disappointment the other night.  I waited almost 30 minutes for a cold turkey sandwich!  After working all day and sitting in traffic for an hour the last thing I want to do is sit in a fast food joint for that long, especially when all the "kids" behind the counter are messing around talking about their homework and girlfriends or boyfriends and not working.  I have been going to this location for a dilly bird for longer than I can remember, but unfortunately I will not be returning any time soon unless someone can guarantee I wont have to sit and listen to teenagers for a half hour while I wait for a cold sandwich.
4	Who the heck doesnt love huge amounts of toilet paper and free samples of food... come on now!
5	This is definitely the best Indian restaurant in Phoenix. The tandoori chicken and aloo tikki wraps are to die for. You cannot go wrong with this place!
4	Thanks to Yelp I was able to read they charge extra for the gas before freaking out on the people at the fron on my way out.  The staff was extreemly helpful and even told me there was one open spot close to the front. They were there ready to pick me up before I had my trunk open. The ride was smooth and direct.  As long as the car is there when I return this place rocks!
5	I eat there about 3 times a week!! The antipasto salad and bread are addicting and cant be beat!
3	I went here last year when I was in AZ, I thought it was Gods gift to Mexican food... I was a bit tipsy last year when I went there... I went again last week, it was "ehhhh". Dont get me wrong, still good, but not as wonderful as I remembered... not even close.  We had to wait an hour for a table, the waiter made us wait about 15 minutes (not kidding) for water and chips/salsa... Seriously, 15 minutes? You dumbass!  The desserts were super good though, that was the upside...
5	Wow, Chill rocks. Frank and his lovely wife, the proprietors, are fantastic. The prices are super low and the gelato/sorbet is awesome. While we were there, a little kid dropped the top part of his cone on the ground. Frank replaced it for free.  Then he gave us a sample of the fat-free, sugar-free chocolate sorbet, which made me want to buy a pint of it... after I had already eaten a baby sized Mango/Pomegranate mix. Yum.  How about this: Go have dinner/lunch/breakfast/whatever at Pita Jungle, then walk across the parking lot to Chill for dessert. That sounds like the perfect evening.
2	My name is Christi and Im a carb addict. Bread with my pasta. My lovers pizza crust (classy, oui?). Hashbrowns with my French toast.  Ive tried to quit, but I cant. And, Ive also resigned myself to the life-is-too-short theory, so what the hay, bring on the starch. I did almost get a salad at Bar Louies because it was a pretty late dinner and I wanted to save room in my belly for dirty martinis. But, they have an appetizer that I couldnt live without trying - Warm Pretzel sticks. 4 huge soft, warm pretzels covered in salt, served with cheese sauces and honey mustard dip. Simple, yet during my carb withdrawl that night, it was the greatest tasting thing I had ever eaten.  I can vouch for the pretzels, but other than that, the service blew chunks. Over 15 minutes to get shots of jager when we were the only table in our servers section. When people order jager, that means theyre on a mission, so give it to them...fast!  We canceled our drinks and left to drink wine in our hotel room. We knew wed get drinks faster there.  If youre gonna go, go for the pretzels, not for the jager.
4	My wife and I decided to take a little vaca to celebrate our 13th anniversary and also was the first time that we were traveling with our 5-month old, so you can imagine we were a little apprehensive.  The resort is absolutely top-notch, the rooms are very spacious, the staff is very courteous, and the facilities are simply superb.  Our room overlooked the mountain, and in the morning, it was blissful to sit outside and sip on our cups of joe.  The rooms have a microwave and a small fridge, something that was invaluable to us to store milk and warm it up for our little one.  The spa is simply one of the best in the valley, and even if you dont stay here, I would recommend the spa to anyone.  The resort is close to at least 20 golf courses, something that might be important to other golf nuts like me.  So then why not 5 stars? Simply because they would not extend the check-out time for us by even an hour.  The check-out is 11 am and our flight was delayed to 8 pm, so when I requested, I was told VERY NICELY, but firmly that it wasnt going to happen.  Ive traveled some, and have NEVER been turned down for a late check-out request, ever.  Still, a great place to stay, the facilities are top-notch, the staff is very nice, and we had a wonderful time.  Would recommend this to anyone wanting a relaxing, fun experience in the Valley of the Sun.  Cheers.
3	I have been to Butters on numerous occasions - the latest being with three senior golfing friends from out of town.  Over the last few years, we have tried numerous breakfast places on their trips, searching for a breakfast that would satisfy all of their different tastes.  After trying six or seven different places, I brought them to Butters, since it was on our way to the golf course.  We all ordered something different, including a skillet, bacon and eggs, pancakes, and an omelette.  The service was fast, and friendly. In fact, we have one picky eater, who always sends his bacon back, because it isnt as crisp as he demands.  The waitress handled his grumbling very nicely, and even had him laughing about it. The atmosphere is somewhat trendier than Butterfields, which was a very big plus for my senior friends.  They also commented on the friendly service, and the reasonable prices. It didnt surprise me that when it came time for breakfast on the final three days they were here, they all voted to come to Butters for breakfast. It should be noted that we came on the weekdays when it isnt as busy on the weekends. I have been in the area on weekends, and it always appears that there is a waiting line. The only thing keeping it from more stars, are the hash browns.  They are obviously prepackaged (or at least taste that way) - and a real breakfast place should have signature hash browns.  But all in all, a nice addition to the area.
4	I live in north Phoenix and believe me there needs to be a lot more quality dining out here. This is a gem. The atmosphere is tops. The food is consistent. The management actually cares. Its just a cool place all the way around! A lot of corporate establishments seem to yank popular things off the menu cause its just not trendy anymore. Every single thing I have had at this place was delicious! Not one other restaurant has pulled that off. A place you can actually count on for a good evening. High five to the Yard house!
4	This place is so good. I love the big sandwhiches and the soups are so delicious. The only complaint I have is that I went twice and I unfortunately got hair and a fingernail clipping in my soup in two different times I went.
4	I always find good used records at Zia.  I know Ill come out with something.  Theyre pricing is usually pretty high on records/artists/genres that are popular or trendy.  Thats pretty standard for anyplace.  The Ghost of Eastside keeps their prices slightly lower with more obscure selection. However, the flipside is that Zia will overlook gems in their used stock and price them pretty low.  Probably because they dont know much about certain band line-ups, labels or releases in general.  Ive found quite a few gems for two or three bucks in the used section.   Used records are where its at.  There is no rationale in buying anything new because theyll press those things in such high numbers that theyre not rare anymore.  Ill still buy some new things from bands and such.  Not a lot. Anyhow, I inadvertantly went to this Zia on record store day.  I was eating with my kids at that Chinese place around the corner. I found a bunch of shit (not all rare but stuff I wanted): The Shit Lickers EP "Cracked Cop Skulls (total early swede crust/dis), Orchid s/t 7" on Hand Held Heart, The Automatics "Golden Hits" and "Makin Out", Chubbies "Im the King" 7" on Sympathy, The Tie That Binds "Adding Machine" 7", Gravy Train "Hello Doctor" LP.  All %15 off for record store day. Ill always check out Zia.  Ill always check out anyplace that sells records but I have to say that I do like Zia.
5	One word to describe this hotel: quality. The pools were all warm and unique. The hotel has two hot tubs, one that changes colors at night and is next to a man made stream, the other is on its own "island". There are two pools, a lazy river, and a small pool. The rooms were comfortable and the whole facility was clean. One thing that must be commented on is the staff was not only efficient but they were very friendly and nice. All of the food and room service I ordered was filled with superb flavor and had good presentation. The hotel also has a botanical garden, herb garden, multiple lawns, and it contains different food services. I highly recommend the ranchero pulled pork tacos and the sushi. The Marriott burger, creme  brûlée, drinks, and fromage board was very good.
4	I was a dim sum virgin until yesterday!  My wonderful wife Audrey W was there to share my experience with me as were Dottsy Z, Donald S, Marian and Kevin H.  And Dottsy has pictures too!  And wow did I get off cheap!   The best dim sum I have ever had!  Honestly, the only dim sum I have ever had!  Im so glad I had other yelpers that were experienced to share it with and help me enjoy the first time! Seriously, Phoenix Palace has really good dim sum.  I enjoyed nearly everything I tried, there was tremendous variety and high quality through and through.  I was not quite as adventurous as some of the more experienced folks at the table.  I did pass on a dish that featured tripe.  Sorry.  Maybe I wasnt ready to go all the way. The review trend has risen over the last few months.  I think I heard there was a change in ownership or management or possibly a new chef.  Or all of the above.  I dont know but it was good. For 6 people and loads of food the total was just under $70.  Unreal. Great lunch spot for dim sumderful variety and a total bargain.  Phoenix Palace is in the same parking lot as Lee Lee Oriental Supermarket so you can fill up on dim sum before you do your shopping.  Then youll spend less when you go shopping.  Never go shopping hungry.
5	Three cheers to Yelp for helping me find where in the Valley to go for real beef jerky!  The fresh stuff which has more beef than chemicals.  (The convenience store packages just were not doing it for me!) After checking out the website, I emailed good friends in Las Vegas (who used to live in Minnesota), asking if they were familiar with Von Hansons.  (They have 21 locations in Minnesota - and ONE in Chandler.) My roommate and I went on July 2. They were running a special for NY strips - buy one, get one free - so that was added to the plan in addition to the jerky.SCORE!  We picked up a half pound each of the peppered jerky and the cajun spicy.  $18/lb.  The NY strips were (if memory serves...) $14.99/lb, and the steaks were averaging a little over 3/4 lb - so super yay for the BOGO sale - it brought the meat down to regular grocery prices. I have to say - the quality of the meat is amazing!  Just looking at the cuts in the display case, I can declare Von Hansons makes AJs look like Frys!  These were GORGEOUS!  Quite possibly the prettiest steaks Ive ever seen!I also grabbed a couple pigs ears for my dog, and the roommate picked up a package of her favorite kind of sausage (linguisa). Admittedly, I am not a sausage expert.  Plus, I live very close to Schreiners - so while I would have no problem buying sausage from Von Hansons, I wouldnt make the hike to Chandler just for those.  The selection was quite impressive, though! Overall - this place has everything for carnivorial happiness!  (Hey - if you understood the context, its a word, right?)  Great selection of beef, chicken and pork products.  Tons of spices, sauces, rubs and marinades.  Nice selection of unique beer and wines.  Fridge and freezer cases with more meats, sides, and desserts! Yes, its pricey - but the quality is certainly there to justify it. Once home, we grilled up the steaks using our favorite rub.  OMG amazing meat!  Probably the best steak Ive had in YEARS - and NY strip isnt even my cut of choice! The peppered beef jerky is full of YUM - and this is so strange to write - but the Cajun is a bit spicy for my taste.  (And I adore spicy!)  Its amazingly good, and addictive - but almost requires a cold beer to go along with it to help cut the heat. The Vegas via Minnesota friends emailed back Monday - they know Von Hansons quite well - and are grateful there isnt one in Vegas - it would KILL the weekly grocery budget with how often theyd be in!  They love, love, LOVE the place - and I am now under strict orders to bring them care packages from here whenever I come up to visit! Oh - and Layla (my pooch) was pretty stoked about the pig ears - so in addition to my five stars, please add two paws up!  (I didnt tell her they have a whole dog food and treat section - I am on a budget, after all!)
5	This place is great! I really appreciate the extreme friendliness and kindness of the employees. Best customer service. Also, the variety of favors is fantastic!
3	This store is a average. It has a six month wall. This place does not bag and board new issues unless asked. The store specializes in new stuff only and has almost no back stock. The store has tournaments for card gaming on weekends. The staff doesnt talk to new customers much or ask them if they need assistance. Note for true comic fans... This store is good for new comics on Wednesdays and supplies but that is about it. Dime-a-dozen store... nothing special.
2	This is not that great of a place.  Its very upscale but the folks behind the sushi bar dont really seem to know what they are doing.  It took forever to get a beer and a sake here.  The worst part was the sashimi yellowtail.  It looked like it was purple on the edges.  If you want to play it safe and get a tuna roll, it will be safeway quality but nothing too special.  This place is more about atmosphere and where to eat if you have a glittery scottsdale shirt you need to show off.
2	I so wanted to love this place. Id heard great things about the food, love the concept and was looking forward to a wonderful experience. What a disappointment.  We were seated within 20 minutes or so of arrival, which was great considering the crowd. It was nice to have somewhere to walk around, and we were able to serve ourselves tea and coffee while we waited.  Once seated, however, it took 20 minutes for anyone to take our order, and another 45 for the food to come. Our food arrived cold. Husband and I both ordered eggs "over medium;" mine were runny and undercooked, his were hard and scaly. "Home fries" were a mound of mushy, under-seasoned potatoes. We were offered jam when the food came, but the waitress never returned with it. My husband asked one of the other staff if they had any jam, received a curt, "yes" as a reply, but they didnt offer to help in any way.  For the prices (average $10 plus $2.25 for a self-serve drink), I can think of many places Id rather spend my dining dollars. Yes, the grounds are lovely and I like that most of the food is from local suppliers (which does not mean it was raised on THIS farm, BTW), but there are many lovely patios in Phoenix with much better food and service.
4	I still really like the Studio Movie Grill, but sat in the "General Admission" seats last night for the first time, and found that they were not nearly as comfortable as the "Reserved" seats with their own little tables.  Unfortunately. The GA seats are also quite tightly shoved together, so if it is a full house you are bumping up against your neighbor, and it is distracting. Best bet:  Go to a un-crowded movie and sit in one of the reserved seats that is not pre-reserved (not pre-sold, and doesnt have the little "reserved" sign on it) to enjoy the reserved seats at the GA price.
3	I ate here after eating at the one in San Diego a couple times.  I was a little disappointed.  The place was kind of depressing and slow moving, but I was there at 8:15 on a Tuesday.  Overall, the food wasnt that good.  I had one of the soups and it was just okay. I would definitely be willing to give this place another shot, though.  I really liked some of the stuff at the SD location and I would like to try it here. If you have never been to a Loving Hut, it is worth a visit to see the crazy TV channel and some of the inventive dishes. I strongly recommend the things that look like breaded chicken legs but are really filled with mushrooms.  That thing is tasty.
5	I love love this store!! Their reduced fat chicken salad and pasedena salads are to die for. The prepackaged frozen meals are also yummy! My daughter loves their yogurt and premade pasta meals. Their clif bars are 1/2 the price as supermarkets!! The employees are extremely nice and helpful. I would SO recommend this store to any and every one!!
5	Great food and service! Country food at its best!
5	Treats: We tried the cookies (chocolate chip and chocolate truffle) and would have to give them 5stars. Delicious!   Breakfast: Seems like they changed the recipe for the turkey maple sausage so it now has an odd herb flavor and less maple flavor, but tried the flattened meatball and liked it so might switch to that option.  **If you go, be sure to check out the bathrooms. Each one was decorated uniquely by a staff member, and  the sinks are shared by both genders. You also get to see how very clean kitchen the kitchen is as you walk to the bathrooms, so that is a great bonus.  Overall, a great non-chain place for unique and delicious food.
4	I pass by it everyday and my son goes to the daycare in the same center so I had been wanting to try it.  I just recently started liking wine so of course I was excited about trying something new.  We were greeted right away, and seated at a table that felt like we had to shout to one another - haha... so we moved to the cozy little couch in the corner which was a 100% improvement.  Intimate but casual and very comfy... and close to the tv (basketball).  They played Sade all night which I really enjoyed... I love her. Our waiter seemed kinda weird at first and he did "forget about us" a couple times... but he made up for it with complementary glasses of wine, so we forgave him.   We tasted an Ausi white wine but I didnt care for it.  Then we tried the Gewürztraminer which I really liked.  I guess I go for German whites???  But Ill be the first to admit I have no idea what the heck Im talking about when it comes to wine :o)  But I do look forward to lots of learning! Anyway, we ordered the bruscetta for a little snack which were all very good.   *Smoked Salmon, mascarpone & taramosalata *Dates drenched in soy sauce with spicy Chorizo (my 2nd fav,mmm spicy!) *Fig, Prosciutto & Brie (both our favs) *Sun dried tomato, gorganzola & walnuts (we actually ordered the artichoke but got this by mistake, but we both liked it - and Im not a huge sun-dried tomato fan either) I cant wait to go back and try more wine and more of the delicious sounding food!  Crocodile, kangaroo, paninis... YUM!
2	Sky Harbor is one poor gateway to the city of Phoenix and the Valley of the Sun.  It is outdated, super crowded, it feels dirty and it is the home of US Airways, the biggest carrier in and out of this airport. Terminal 4 is configured rather poorly.  The terminal reminds me of a backwards E, like the second E in EMIN3M, except that there is another prong to the backwards E.  The concourses are not spacious at all, the seating limited, and consequently the crowds spill out into the walkway areas. .   To go from one end of Terminal 4 to the other necessitates using really narrow moving walkways which are on the spine of the E.  It is really hard to maneuver if you want to pass the throngs given the limited space.  The distances are long, the bruises will be many, either to you but most likely given by you as you negotiate your way between flights. The other thing that must be mentioned is that Sky Harbor is not a business persons airport but rather a tourist airport.  I think that contributes a lot to the chaos.  When an airport is full of amateurs, like Sky Harbor, there are bottlenecks of humanity in all the wrong places.  Further exacerbating the tourist nature of this airport are the snowbirds who flock here so that they can seek skin cancer in all months of the year, not just summer in their native habitats of the Upper Midwest. Get going on the remodel since it is long overdue and make sure you take in mind the tourists and the business traveler when updating this airport.
3	I still really love coming to LGO...especially to relax on their patio with some good food and good drink. I love that LGO sells Framboise and I love the hectic and busy atmosphere.  HOWEVER, the time has come for me to drop a star. I am a regular fixture at LGO and lately have noticed that they seem to be running out of some of my favorite items on a regular basis. For example, the MJ Cookie...it is one of the few items that makes my mouth water at just the thought of it. Its like a brownie and cookie rolled into one. So heavenly. Unfortunately, LGO has been out of the MJ Cookie 4 out of my last 5 visits. And these visits are at all different times of the day/week. I know they get busy and I know a restaurant can run out, but it seems to happen so frequently and every time its a big, BIG let down. And sadly, the cookie is not the only item that they run out of regularly. Lately, Ive had a hard time finding the pre-made salads that I like too. My other issue just occurred and I cannot seem to pull myself out of the depression that it has caused. They no longer serve the green chile mac and cheese! Seriously. When I stopped in recently for lunch, I was so disappointed that this has been removed from the menu that I thought about walking out. I know that seems like a silly reaction to macaroni and cheese, but their green chile mac and cheese was by far one of the best items I found on their menu.  Their sandwiches are tasty, but almost impossible to hold together. Their pizzas have great fresh ingredients, but always seem to be lacking something. And now this...no more mac and cheese. And theyre always out of MJ cookies! It is a sad sad day at LGO. =(
5	Great service
5	Heather is awesome. She did my initial set of lashes and Ive already gone back for a fill. Her prices are great and she does beautiful work! The compliments are rolling in. Absolutely recommend!
4	Pretty good. Oxtail was awesome. Plantains were just like I remembered them in the Carribbeans. The jerk chicken was okay... Needs a little more heat. Beef patty good (Id eat it again). The workers were outstandingly nice.
3	Ive heard about this place being "the best" burger joint so i had to check it our for myself. My boyfriend and i went on a saturday afternoon and to my surprise most of the seats were taken, people were coming and going so my first thought was they must be good since they were so busy. Severs were really nice and prompt. we both ordered their 1/3 lb arizona smashburger which has: habanero cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, chipolte mayo and fresh jalapenos on a chipotle bun, we also had an order of their smash fries. first thought, the presentation of the burgers and fries looked great, after putting mustard and ketchup on it and TRIED to pick up the burger everything almost feel out. It was messy and greasy totally ruined the experience of enjoying the burger. It tasted like any other burger, nothing really special about it. Their fries however were amazing.  on a scale of 1-10 i would give this place a 6 just for the food presentation. my boyfriend said he wouldnt go back but ill give it another try one day.
4	I registered at both the combo Toys R Us/Babies R Us store by my house (on Bell Rd) and finished up at this location, since it had a larger variety. Nice goody bag, ample selection of items.  Furniture prices are over inflated, but that seems typical for all baby furniture.  You get lots of coupons too once you sign up for their rewards program which come in really handy! There are changing tables in the restrooms as well as fantastic mothers rooms..which have a rocker, sofa, and changing tables, as well as wipes, diapers, etc. Great for breastfeeding discreetly!
