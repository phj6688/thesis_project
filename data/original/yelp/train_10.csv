5,"Stopped by here for lunch today... I saw the Burger sign outside and thought I would try it out. WOW!! This place is amazing. The owner/chef was taking the orders and was super helpful and friendly. I had a Paradise CHZ which came with 2 patties, smoked mozzarella lettuce, tomato, caramelized onion as well as cucumber. I also ordered  Sweet Potato Tater Tots I was blown away! BEST BURGERS IN PHOENIX!  Our bill came to $18 for 2 cheese burgers, 2 sides and a soda.  It was so amazing I went back for dinner. I bragged to much when I got home that my boyfriend just had to try it. I had the special which was a Roasted Duck Burger (2 beef patties, topped with roasted duck, caramelized onions, bacon, fried egg over easy served with duck au jus) By far the best burger of my life. My boyfriend got the Beach House (2 beef patties. roasted green chili, smoked mozzarella, pico de gallo and jalapeno ranch) He also ordered the seasoned fries. I dont care for fires and I think I could eat 3 orders they were so good. His was so good he ordered another burger.  For Desert we shared a Maple Pecan Bacon Milkshake, also to die for. I really think I need one of these every night. From the atmosphere, the music, the staff to the food every thing about PV Burgers was a hit. This is a must go!"
5,"I have been living in Arizona for 4 years and have yet to find a decent Italian Beef Sandwich, until now.  I even gave the same statement to the owner.  I had ordered an Italian Beef for carry out, and while I was waiting, I let him know my frustrations.  He gave me his card and told me to call him after I ate the sandwich because he wanted to know what I thought.  Well, it was FANTASTIC!  Of course, I called him back to let him know.   The service, and the time and effort put into the food cannot be beat.  This is what you get for a mom and pops type place.   There are plenty of other sandwiches and foods there too.  I cant wait to go back and try some more!"
4,"Wow! what a great meal last night. Kinda nervous to go back after being there a cpl of years ago for lunch and not loving it. BUTTTTT 2 words: Boiled Wontons. Order these and u will prob crave them for days. Spicy broth with boiled wontons in a light peanut sauce. I also ordered my fave, Peking duck. Very impressed with the quality and will be going back more. They do bring the food out superman fast so you kinda feel rushed but other than that, i see why they are sooo packed."
5,"Been here twice now and wish I could say more. The food is delicious, the set up is really relaxing and service is great. A great place to take an out of town guest. Happy hour menu has these amazing tofu tacos that I highly recommend. My boyfriend had the Pork tacos which he said were also delish. Definitely check this place out!!"
4,"Ive been here twice now for the lunch buffet and the second time I even brought a friend who was a foodie and both times it was great. They have a great selection of dips on the buffet, a few salads and many warm entrees to choose from.  I recommend taking a little bit of everything and if you follow my rule, you wont be disappointed. Everything is absolutely delicious and youll have fun guessing the spices in the various dishes.  If youre in the mood for some tasty middle eastern food, I would really recommend it. Its a little short on ambiance, but with flavors like that, whos looking anywhere but their plate?"
5,"We happened upon this location when meeting a friend for dinner.  When I showed up there was a line of about 20 people ahead of me.  i asked them to put me in first available and they said 15-20min and then 45min for a booth. Ok, Ill wait. Our friends showed up and my girlfriend had asked if there was a spot at the bar we could sit in the mean time.  We were there for about 10min already.  Thats when she said to us. ""Your table inside is ready""  she walked us right there and we were sat.  WOW!  that was quick! We ordered drinks and food.  I got these jerk chicken wings for an appetizer and holy cow, they were delicious.  For my main dish I ordered a garlic noodle dish.  It definitely hit the spot.  My only beef would be that it was hard to talk with so many people inside.  I wont let that affect the rating though. Awesome place!"
5,"We were here on Wednesday, 12/21/11. We had been at a Rubios in CA recently and was extremely disappointed. Not this time! Jacob was our order taker and was VERY courteous and professional.  My husband got two fish tacos that were a good size and yummie. I went with the grilled veggie burrito and man, it was huge and tasty! This is what Rubios is about!"
4,"This place is very cool! I went here after work with a sorority sister for drinks on a Friday night. Ended up staying for like 3.5 hours. Fantastic atmosphere with outdoor and indoor seating. Lighting is dim and intimate indoors with rustic seating areas and large booth perfect for groups getting drinks together. The outdoor patio is sectioned off in a covered area with tables and smaller seats while an uncovered area hosted seating for peeps who rode their bikes in. The drinks are pretty yummy. If youre into fruity, girly cocktails there isnt much to choose from, but for a more mature, grown-u beverage, youre in luck. Hit the happy hour (which sadly ends at 5pm). It gets a tad loud and it difficult to tell the wait staff apart from the customers because theyre all in street clothes but theyre very attentive and sweet. We ordered the fondu plate and it was great. Pretzels, sausage, apples and the cheese... perfect for sobering up a bit from those yummy cocktails."
3,"Best time to work out at this gym is in the early morning.  Went in the afternoon a few times and its usually packed.   This place has everything I need to work out. (threadmill, free weights, machines, basketball court, swimming pool, and sauna).  Rarely do I see any of the machines out of order/ broken.  Although the mens sauna bench was broken for maybe 2-3 months before they finally fixed it."
5,"Stopped in for Margs and appetizers. Had 2 house Margaritas......AM I DRUNK? Holy MOLY what do they put in those things? Food was great, drinks were better, Ill be back!"
5,"As much of a sweet tooth that i have (dark decadent chocolate is my weakness)..Toffee was never my thing ,never on my mind .. And then i sampled Goodytwos toffee ..wowzer ! Sweet and salty toffee is regoddamndiculously good ..seriously good ! They have a toffee topped popcorn ..these gals are killing me ..oh ,oh the twozels sinfully delish magical pretzel mix with kettle corn ,nuts and chocolate . Listen ,you cant put a price on happiness ,ha ha  Everyone i love is getting their stockings stuffed with a box of salty-sweet love from Goodytwos. Nothing more delicious or sexy ,ya sexy then a salty sweet combo ..it is a heavenly pairing ..Goodytwos has perfected this,worth every penny ! Rock on ladies !"
4,"I have had the opportunity to watch games at the Staples Center, and Honda Center in Los Angeles and Anaheim. Both are great arenas and are very fan friendly. Jobing.com is totally different, and thats not a bad thing! I really enjoy the arena is in the same complex with restaurants and movie theater. Great place to hang out before and after the game. Parking is great, I actually had a parking pass and did not use it. I just parked at the west gate parking lot. The arena was very easy to acess, and we had a great time. We will be coming back many more times."
4,"I eat here at least once every week since its close to my office, and they are always quick, tasty and reasonably priced.   I usually get one of the lunch specials (even the Chinese-sounding dishes have a Thai flair, especially if you order them with extra spice), but if youre hungry the house special chicken is well worth the extra buck, as are the Thai noodle dishes (the pad see ew is my favorite).   The wait staff is always friendly, the food is always quick, good and reasonably priced.  i havent had a bad experience in several dozen visits, and ill continue to call myself a regular."
4,"So im not here to buy spices or shop for sheesha, im here for food. Lots and lots of food. Luckily for me, Haji-Baba is known for tons of food at decent prices so I have a promising evening of stuffing my face without breaking my wallet. God, I sound like a really cheap buffet commercial. But really, to be truthfully, super blunt, honest-to-go-honest truth, Haji-Babas food is not the best in the world but it is 1) fresh, 2) good quality, 3) tasty and 4) cheap. I am sure you can find better Mediterranean food around town, but this place is really good on your wallet and fits my needs just right. And hey, 215 reviews cant be lying. THE PEOPLE LIKE IT. They like it a lot. I ordered the gyro deluxe (gyro with raw onions and feta cheese), a side order of hummus, Babaganoush (eggplant dip), tried my friends lamb tongue and a pistachio  baklava.  If you are feeling adventurous and want to try the lamb tongue, lemme tell you: dont. Really, dont. There is nothing tasty about lamb tongue. It tastes slightly like roast beef but the texture resembles congealed liver patee and the big chunks are really scary. The only positive about eating tongue? Infinite pun jokes about talking about it forever. Get it? The gyro meat was pretty standard in the Gyro deluxe sandwich, the best thing about it was the creamy fresh salty feta cheese. Its the freshest ive ever had and they really DO slap it on that sandwich, like a boss. The babaganoush was also very very tasty with the pickle and the black olive- however- i would have liked bigger pieces of roasted eggplant than a hummus-like texture. The hummus was just A-OK, it needed more of a PUNCH of flavor. Last but not least, the baklava is my favorite dessert in all the land.. so obviously I enjoyed it. Heavy on the honey and not very crispy on the nuts, but pretty decent nonetheless. In conclusion, only use the tongue in your mouth and not the one on the menu, get as much feta cheese as your body can process and buy a desert to-go. BAM, lunch is served."
5,"I LOVE this place! From the moment you walk up to the door, it is spotless. Sometimes you will be approached by an employee asking if you need assistance, majority of the time, you wont talk to one employee, which is great! I just want to go in, get what I need, and peace out until next time without the small chatter.  Their hummus is AMAZING, along with a few of the prepackaged meals. Their Creamy Cilantro Salad Dressing is OMG AMAZING!! Sweet tea... LOVE IT!!"
5,"Oh my gooooooooodness!  I love this store.  I have been a tea enthusiast ever since I received a cast iron tea pot for Christmas.  A few weeks ago, I purchased a Groupon for $20 worth of merchandise for $10 and headed over to the store.  The experience was amazing.  The varieties were intriguing, the prices were reasonable, and the owner was very knowledgeable and friendly.  Also, the layout of the store was appealing and inviting.   When we visited the store, we received a packet of tea for the stores 1st birthday.  I hope there will be many more to come."
4,"I was surprised to see that this place has such low ratings on yelp- it is one of my favorite Mexican places in the valley.  Favorite dishes include: mini beef tacos, Tapopo Salad (iceberg lettuce, cheddar cheese, chicken, peas, corn, beans, tomatoes and large amount of quacamole under it all), fresh salsa, and Tacos Al Carbon. All freshly prepared and wonderful tasting. If you have kids, ask to sit in the blue room by the fish tank - the decor is fun and mysterious and will keep young children distracted thru the entire meal."
5,"Marcellino and Sima are finally back after their yearly 1 month Italy vacation (re-opened September 10th)....and are we glad they are back!   We had a fabulous duo appetizer: fresh fig and prosciutto and the second was a filet (carpaccio) with shaved mushroom and black truffle!  Delicious!  Ive always been a fan of prosciutto and melon, but the fresh fig was tremendous! Marcellino also brought us a fresh black truffle cream for his crusty bread, mmmm, amazing.  I dont think you can get this anywhere (fresh), even here if you ask for it, but we were lucky to be in the right place at the right time! Pasta duo was tortellini with even more truffles and a wild boar pappardelle.  Best hand made pastas anywhere.  Perfect! Main course was a perfectly cooked filet with his mashed potatoes and julienned vegetables...and more truffles!  So right...so full!  Im so glad we had an hour spinning class before embarking on this journey! We ended up skipping desert and had some left over to go!  What a perfect Italian dinner paradise! We cant wait to go back for opera night...and of course we are waiting for his next wine dinner.  Best in the valley."
3,"This would actually be another 2.5 Star experience but I went ahead and rounded it up to 3 stars since I am in a good mood.  We came here after going to Chelseas Kitchen down the street which was super packed for the night.  I easily get annoyed with complementary valet parking because I hardly ever carry cash and feel weird if I do not tip the valet boys and girls but I digress.... The concept and look of this place is really fun and different.  I felt like I was in a modern barn.  We walked in and put our name on the list and was surprised that it is all done by an i-Pad and you receive a text message when your table is ready.  Good thing the bf and I remembered our phones or else we would have been out of luck.  The wait wasnt horrible.  We went to the bar and got a couple of glasses of wine, the bartenders didnt seem really in a hurry to help us which got me a little annoyed. We were seated in a cozy, and I mean cozy 2 top table right in a main traffic way.  My bf and I are not big people and felt uncomfortable in the size of the table.  I know you want to pack a lot of tables in a small space but at the expense of the customer?  Our waiter was friendly enough but not as friendly as he was to the group of women that was seated next to us.... nothing like treating all your tables equal huh? We ordered an appetizer, the zucca chips, which had a decent flavor but were a little burnt.  We ordered out main dishes which were a chicken dish and their version of spaghetti and meatballs.  The wait for the food wasnt bad either but I hate when you as the customer have to ask for a wine list because your wine was empty for 10 minutes but the waiter didnt ask if you wanted anything else because he was focused on the table of 5 women next to us sharing an appetizer.   I had the pasta and meatballs, which was meh.  The pasta was a little mushy and the meatballs really didnt have much flavor.  My bf had the chicken dish with spinach which he loved!  All in all the experience wasnt bad but wasnt good.  Maybe they are still working out their kinks but this place probably wont be high on my list to return any time soon!"
5,"This is Mesas best breakfast, hands down! This is one of my familys favorite Saturday/Sunday brunch places in the valley.  Crackers & Co. is great food at great prices and we always take out-of-town guests there when visiting! I was never a fan of eggs unless they were scrambled or in an omelette, but Crackers showed me the way to delicious fried and poached eggs!  The Eggs Benny is great, both Traditional and California-style. Their omelettes are huge and never overcooked (my fave: Spinach Mushroom) . The skillets are mighty tasty and really satisfying (my fave: The Vatican with eggs over easy). Try their French toast... its got great flavor and is delightfully crispy.  If you get a chance, try lunch there! Their soups are so scrumptious and the sandwiches are to die for! The Cream of Spinach and Artichoke soup tastes just like a bowl of spinach and artichoke dip, and they dont skimp on the artichokes at all! The Chicken Dumpling soup is seriously the best Ive ever had (Im not even a fan of dumplings!)! The Roma Tomato Chicken Melt is my favorite sandwich on the menu (such good flavor!), followed closely by the Drunken Chicken sandwich. Their burgers are quite good and along with their salads, they serve up a hefty portion! Beware though of 30 to 45 minute wait times on the weekends in the winter due to snowbirds flocking for breakfast. The wait times let up about 12:30P though, so its great for those who cant decide between breakfast or lunch!"
5,"Ive been planning a visit to the Public Market for some time now, and was downtown today so I finally stopped in for lunch.  I had the ""Friggin Chicken"", which was friggin delicious.  The market fare is counter service, but when I was ordering the cashier was very friendly and courteous and brought my food to me out on the patio. This was a very pleasant first experience, sitting on the patio reading a book, sipping my canned mint green tea, and eating my sandwich with a side of couscous.  The atmosphere was very relaxed and there were others nearby sharing a bottle of wine, or just finishing up their lunch with good conversation.  Speaking of the wine, there was an impressive wine and craft beer selection.  Ill be going back to sample the beverages very soon. On my way out, I stopped at the coffee bar for a latte, which was much more bold and flavorful than your ""Fast Food Coffee"" variety; a great way to finish off my lunch.  If youre looking for a quick, inexpensive, fresh and local dining experience, check this place out."
4,"I like this Sams. I get my eye exams/contacts/glasses here and some groceries. Its almost always pretty dead and therefore easy to get in and out quickly and easily. They dont have nearly the selection that most Costco do, but Ive never waited in line here."
3,"Finding this quaint location wasnt to hard... i like that there is a parking lot right north of the place... as well as street parking :)  you walk in the place and wow... its a completely different atmosphere... low lighting but in a calming way rather than creepy...  they have a DJ.. the music makes the setting but to be honest it was a little odd for my taste,,,  Our waitress was very nice and helpful... automatically served us cucumber water... (which tastes amazing!!) and then asked for our drink orders ... a good waitress can seriously turn everything upside down or completely make your visit ya know... its a pet peeve of mine.. customer service...  every table had a pink candle lit... pink lights hung above the chefs area... it was just so relaxing! the mirrors on the wall around this cool looking splatter painting... i was diggin it...  everything on their menu is served as appetizers... which kinda sucks.. they are all at least 6-12 bucks at least ... from what i saw.. and the waitress said that they recommend for people to get at least 2-3 a piece.... wow, on top of drinks.. its kinda pricey to me.. good thing we shared everything...  the lemongrass chicken (cant remember the full title) was amazing!! so good... the gyozo (dumplings) were alright.. a little too minty for my taste... we had this other thing where they bring you the hot stone and you cook your own meat... it was alright but the stone only stayed hot enough to cook the meat med rare... i dont like my meat to moo at me... so its was alright... but i prefer it well done...  the beef wrapped in grape leaves.. well i was soo excited to try them.. but was sadly disappointed... they were so fiery hot (spicy) that i almost had tears in my eyes... never did it say on the menu .. SPICY... after a server came over and saw us gasping for water.. he filled us up and said, oh yea those are pretty spicy... wow good thing i had my TUMS lol  over all  The atmosphere was amazing.....  the staff was fabulous...  the food... eh...  the menu is crap... if your gonna serve spicy food you should say its spicy! isnt that some sort of health hazard?!  and its kinda on the pricey side...  i think i would go back again... But i dont think i would opt to...  there are alot more dishes i would like to try... maybe a different location would be better?"
5,"Tacos, tacos, tacos......how can something so simple be this great? Having seen this place being featured on DDD we had to try it out and it was worth every penny! I have a thing for always trying the ""odd"" menu items so Ive tried the tongue tacos and cabeza (head/cheek) burrito and to me there is nothing better on the menu! This place is rather small which makes it perfect if youre there with some friends or a special someone! My friend loves the shrimp ceviche though I havent tried it myself. Go to this place for some great authentic, local and quite tasty food.......probably some of the best the east alley has to offer!"
5,"I have been going to the Matador since I was little when it was a little hole in the wall on 2nd Street.  They have always had great Sonoran style Mexican food!  Its always our go to place when we attend events downtown or have business to attend to. They also have the best hot sauce in town!  As far as the service,  the food comes out quickly and we never really have to wait long.  If youre downtown and looking for great food I would highly recommend this place."
3,"I came, I Kiltlifted til the wee hours, caught up with a friend who was in town for a few days and staying nearby. Decent enough bar, was able to talk above the music without yelling, no asshatness witnessed and they have Kiltlifter. Service was attentive, a team effort, yet a bit robotic. They seemed a bit overstaffed, and well , just bored. Did I mention the Kiltlifter?"
2,"I just moved to the area so use Yelp but was very sad that the experience here was not worth making a return visit.  The only reason I am posting is because it has not been reviewed in so long.   I did not like how the spa pedicure was one price and then things you would expect in a spa pedicure was ""upgrades"".  I want to ask for a pedicure and then lay back enjoy the chair and some reading.   After the pedicure, the woman left me in the chair for my nails to dry and think she completely forgot about me!  I would have left if she had put my flip flops on before painting my nails.  Their child was cute, but I do not go to get a pedicure to play games with other peoples children.   Then to top it off, when I paid she asked for my pin as she was walking away (again)....no pin, it was a credit card....usually this would not bother me but I was already frustrated at this point."
5,I love this place. It was so beautiful over the holidays with all the lights and garlands. I think the people who run this have a lot of pride in their business. The room was clean and the beds so comfortable. The decor is rustic but elegant at the same time. I liked how close we got to park to our room...super convenient. Lots of coupons given to us at checkin too. Great experience!
5,I highly reccomend this place. They helped my girlfriend and I figure out our taxes and deductions so that we could get the max refund. We both had been doing our taxes online and missing out on hundreds in deductions. Ill never use another online service to do my taxes again as long as these guys are here.
4,"Been going to Baileys for the last six months. Its an older crowd during the day, but at night and on the weekends the crowd id much younger! Bartenders are all friendly and the drinks are cheap, though they could be stronger. I highly recommend it!"
5,"The best fish tacos, period!  And I hate chain restaurants!"
4,"My sister in law and her fiance took us to Jimmy Johns after discovering it. The location is really convenient to us, which is great. I enjoyed my sandwich. The branding is a little intense. EVERYTHING, right down to the chips, is branded with the Jimmy Johns logo. Its all good but its a little crazy. The sandwiches are big and the cookies they sell by the register are huge! Prices dont seem too bad either. A nice sandwich stop."
4,"Family business bagel shops are my favorite.  I found this place through Groupon and decided to check it out.  The name itself intrigued me as Lox means salmon fillet that is cured.  I didnt go with salmon, but I got a honey wheat bagel with veggie lite cream cheese.  The cream cheese was freshly made with carrots, garlic, and celery.  It had a light taste to go with a healthy and hearty sized bagel.  My friends got croissants with cheese which tasted delicious as well.  The prices are very reasonable here and you can order bagels by the dozen."
5,Love this place! I think this is probably the best Chinese buffet out here! They serve quality gourmet food. And they have a full bar too. Place is clean and service is great. Would go back anytime!
3,"I like this mall.  Its in a decent location, there are lots of good stores, and the clientele here is bearable.  Ive always thought of this mall as just below Scottsdale, but without all the silicone and snobbery.  We went last weekend to kill some time and were a little surprised to see that it was overrun with screaming toddlers.  I guess I should have known that when the AZ temperatures tip past 100 degrees, we have nothing better to do then hang out inside air conditioned malls or hang out inside air conditioned movie theatres, take your pick.  Anyway, the store selection is pretty good here, I just wish they would add a Crate and Barrel and a LUSH, then I would never have to visit Scottsdale again."
1,"We were so disappointed!  We were on vacation in Scottsdale and wanted to try a Brazilian restaurant.  It was nothing like the one we have had home.  Actually it was completely worse than all three Brazilian steakhouses we have close to home.  I tried about 12 different meats and I think there were only 2 out of the 12 that were tender.  The rest were over cooked or hard as a rock.  We really wanted to love this place as I kept trying more and more of the meats as they came around hoping the next one would be better.  Besides being hard, the meats didnt have much flavor.  The salad bar was okay and I dont know that I would even pay the cheaper price to just eat from their salad bar.  This is sad that I have to say the highlight or our meal was the fresh bread and salami slice you get at the salad bar.  :("
1,"I was severely mislead by Frank As, ""Its hot, but the food aint bad."" review.  It was very cold and by far the worst food Ive ever eaten.  You would have to drag me here in cuffs to get me to return."
5,"One of my favorite brunch spots.  Not the cheapest, but you come here to admire the Arcadia families/couples coming into have brunch.  There is sometimes a wait but it is worth it.  I have a hard time deciding between the lunch salads and breakfast.  I usually cave and get the french toast or ginormous belgian waffle.  Parking is plentiful but it is on a weird corner in the strip mall, if you are going, look for cork and cleaver."
2,"This is the first time Ive had a bad experience at an Oreck store. My 6 year old sweeper suddenly began spewing dirt out. The bag wasnt close to full yet and it didnt appear anything was stuck. The sales associate without opening it up began to insist I needed a new roller brush for $40. When I showed him it looked fine to me and wouldnt that be covered by warranty, he got upset with me and began stomping around. I also showed him a warranty sticker from 2010 on the machine which stated that there was a new roller brush installed and also asked him to look up my Oreck warranty. He found my name in their system and then began shoving my sweeper at me insisting I just take it and leave then, since I obviously didnt trust him. This man was totally weird and his behavior and attitude felt very unprofessional.  I still like Oreck but do not recommend this store."
5,"I hate ordering flowers sight unseen, but needed a local florist for a sympathy arrangement. Rachel immediately alleviated any concern when we discussed what I wanted in detail, and she even emailed me a photo of the final arrangement.  Gorgeous flowers, same day delivery and reasonable pricing - cant beat that."
3,"Visited recently for the first time.  Enjoyed happy hour appetizers on the patio.  Cool place for outdoor dining, the waterfall added a nice background.  They offer smoking and non-smoking on separate sides of the patio.  Of course you know that if anyone is smoking, the entire area gets to ""enjoy"" the smoke.  Being a non-smoker, I would appreciate an true non-smoking area but being outdoors was too compelling to pass on this beautiful day.  Another small observation - the tables were too low for the chairs causing you to lean over to eat and the chairs were not comfortable at all.   We ordered chicken quesadilla & crab cake appetizer.  The quesadilla was made w/ green chiles and cheese, served w/ green & red salsa.  Didnt care for the red salsa but the green was pretty good, rather mild.  A side of sour cream was all that was missing here.  Crab cakes were ok, nothing special.  Served w/ a nice side salad it made a very good small meal.  A side of some kind of orange sauce (chipotle?) for the crab cakes that seemed really HOT to me - skip this next time please. Just based on the outdoor atmosphere alone, I would definitely come back again."
5,Its not a standard restaurant as it is in the middle of a grocery store...but thats just what it is get over it!  The food however is fantastic!  I ordered the samosa chaat...A samosa covered in chick peas and other sauces and chatney.  A delicious Punjabi snack!  The portion was very generous and the price cheap.  I also recently ordered a dozen samosas to bring home and serve at a dinner party.  Very convenient and good service.  I will be a regular from now on!
5,Excellent. Fresh and yummy!
5,Great decor. Great food and very good service. You have to try the pork belly pastrami. To die for! Their version of the Manhattan was very good. As for the main courses you cant go wrong with the scallops or the smoked duck. For dessert go with the black & tan pudding. Oh soooo good. Highly recommend this place.
4,"This staff at this United Blood service is first rate. Always quick and effiiant. They are always staffed and ready to go when I arrive for my appointment. Ive donated blood at this location 10+ times and have never had to wait. Of course, I cant encourage everyone enough to donate and donate often."
4,"If you are a beer snob, stay at home trying to make it yourself.  If you enjoy a decent local beer in an old chandler building with a nice atmosphere give this place a shot.  The owner used to be a brew-master at Four Peaks Brewery which is a local favorite in Tempe.   I am not a fan of the over-the-top Hops that a lot of folks enjoy.  A few of the offerings here have a bit too much bite for me.  The red ale was my favorite until they changed the recipe and over did the bitterness.  Right now I get a Sun Devil Ale when I go in and it is pretty good.  They will bring you a taster if you ask and will explain the offerings to help you choose.     The food is always good.  It is a bar so dont expect 5 star cuisine.  The fries are great and the sandwiches and salads are good as well.  I havent been disappointed with a meal yet.  Even when busy service is decent.  Enjoy the beer, watch the game and let it all unfold."
5,"This mall has all the upscale shopping that you will ever need. Just make sure you come here with your credit cards in check as you are bound to fall in love with something when you come here. They have some of the best department stores in my opinion, and if youre looking for that perfect dress for any occasion, you have tons of options to choose from. I love how clean and perfect this mall is!"
4,"Had lunch here with 6 coworkers and the server accomodated 5 seperate checks with no fuss. She quickly brought out two baskets of soft warm bread that looked handmade, along with pouring out balsamic vinegar and light olive oil for dipping. The server described the days special, but we all ended up ordering eight inch pizzas (a lunch only size.) I had bacon and chose to have it cooked in the optional brick oven for $1 extra (not sure why they offer it seperately, but exp. at other places made me like the way it cooks better than reg. oven.) It wasnt much to go on, but the food was good, the service friendly and efficient, and the everything was clean and neat. Recommended if youre in the area."
4,"Cibo is positively adorable.  I love the atmosphere.  I love the little house, and the yard.  I love the excessively busy yet amazingly friendly servers.  I love the iced tea.  I love the bread.  I love the Antipasto plate.  I love making ad-hoc bruchetta out of said bread and Antipasto.  I love the margherita pizza. Just on a Thursday afternoon alone, I dont think Id ever come with a large group of people.  It just doesnt seem like a wise life decision. Really? Its love overall.  Love, love, love, love.  When I can, Im dragging my family here."
2,"just wanted to chime in & say that this place is so vegetarian-UN-friendly its not even funny. I was dragged here with family & ended up ordering a chile relleno, which was just about the only meatless item on the menu, short of a fucking cheese crisp. it wasnt terrible, but this place is really just all kinds of lame. service was mediocre, food was mediocre. with as many awesome & authentic mexican restaurants as there are in the valley, theres no reason on earth to come back, except MAYBE to try a mango margarita."
4,"It is a nice place. Actually when i have just come in, everything seems to look normal. Nothing different frm other nail salons. However, when a lady did manicure and pedicure for me, she did really good service. She always smile a lot, and made you feel comfortable. I will come back soon and tell my friends abt this salon cause they did a good job."
4,"Had the pleasure of enjoying House of Tricks last night, for the second time in the past twelve months. With a party of six, I was excited to get to see a range of dishes and try out most of the menu via my dining companions choices.  The restaurant, found in Tempe near ASU, is not hard to find and houses both indoor and outdoor seating.  The outdoor seating is where we ended up last night and between the fire pit in the middle of the grounds and the abundance of trees/greenery, the setting works quite well.   Our party was seated immediately and without problem, the night was off to a solid start.  Our waitress, Jamie, was both friendly and courteous.  Jamie had a great understanding of the menu, the specials and especially the wine.  Her recommendations for multiple members of the party worked out perfectly.  Each person in our party ordered an appetizer and off we went. I had the pork belly, on Jamies suggestion. Other choices within our party included the salmon cake, sweetbreads two ways, and the scallops.  I thought the pork belly was great. It had a pea puree as a base sauce and some baby carrots that just killed.  The scallops were tasty and cooked perfectly.  The sweetbreads two ways were a bit of a letdown.  As a lover of sweetbreads, I have had the pleasure of tasting some of the best variations of there preparation. These were just not that great.  They werent cooked properly and the seasoning was lacking.  This would be the only lacking dish of the evening. For the entree, I had the pork osso bucco.  This was a real treat, cooked evenly, tender and tasty.  Other entree selections around the table included the ahi tuna, the salmon, and the duck.  The tuna was the standard seared variety on a bed of mashed potatoes.  Both diners who chose this selection were quite satisfied.  My companion had the duck and while she certainly enjoyed the dish, she found the duck slightly fatty.  All around, the entrees were solid and plates were cleaned.   With little room left for dessert, we ordered three selections for the table to share.  All were good and once again our plates were cleaned off.  The dessert best was agreed upon to be the homemade smore the restaurant produces.   All in all, this is a solid restaurant with a good atmosphere and good service.  I would eat here again and recommend you to do the same."
4,I was super excited to find a place in Arizona that has vegetarian pho! The service was just mediocre.  It met basic requirements without any friendliness. Very cost effective= CHEAP.
4,"Came here in a daze after not having slept for a loooong time and flying in to the airport with Dad; reminds me of the nice breakfast diners in Chicago, got the combo with turkey sausage (still greasy--defeats the purpose), eggs (always the same everywhere), french toast (more white bread, nothing too special but filling), coffee.  Nice atmosphere and no major problems, would be great for the weekend brunch!"
4,"While I am giving this restaurant four stars, I must start off by noting that the pizza here is mediocre.  If you want spectacular pizza in Phoenix, dont kid yourself that its at I-17 and Thomas.  Its over at Pizzeria Bianco. However, the other items on the dinner menu are worthy of a visit to the hood.   The Penne alla Vodka ($12.95) offers up pasta in tomato sauce with bacon, fresh basil cream and vodka.  It is an excellent starter to split with a dining companion and thats exactly what the BF and I do every time we visit this place.  The Cozze Posolipo mussels in garlic white wine sauce ($11.95) are also quite tasty as an appetizer.  The complimentary warm pizza dough they serve with an onion and olive topping is a nice touch.  For entrees, the Pollo Parmigiana ($14.95) is the classic breaded chicken breast with marinara, mozzarella and parmesan cheese served with penne.  The Lasagna della Casa with Bolognese sauce ($13.95) is very good, but the portion is a bit stingy for the price.  The BF often enjoys the Gamberi alla Pana ($15.95) that includes jumbo shrimp sautéed with mushrooms in a brandy cream sauce over a bed of fettuccine.  Please note that the brandy cream sauce is extremely rich.  Another tasty option is the Spaghetti con Salsiccia ($13.95) with mushrooms, bell peppers, onions and Italian sausage in marinara sauce with a touch of white wine.  The Cheese Ravioli ($13.95) is another great choice with the tomato cream sauce.  For dessert, be sure to order a Cannoli Siciliani ($5.95) as its the very best I have had in Phoenix.  The Tiramisu ($5.95) is good as well. The bad news is that this place is no longer BYOB.  For whatever reason, the management decided that a restaurant that seats no more than 20 needed a full liquor license.  I really hope that the investment in that spendy license doesnt lead to the undoing of this place.  Given that they dont even have a bar area and I almost never see anyone order a mixed drink, I think staying BYOB might have been a better choice for this neighborhood joint. The service at this place is also part of the show.  The waiter may well be manic as he will either be way up or way down for your visit.  The décor here is pleasant enough given the location of this tiny restaurant in a modest strip mall.  If you happen to need a trip to the restroom, you will get the chance to traipse through the kitchen. All in all, Pizza A Metro is ironically a great option for everything but pizza."
3,"Typical dumpy yet fairly clean little sports bar in a strip mall setting. Get your tires changed next door at Discount Tire and grab a few heinekins while you wait. Beware though, they call it coppers because it is owned and frequented by Cops and for some reason there are a lot of people missing limbs that frequent the place.?. hum. ho."
5,"Being my first review, there is only one place Ive always had a 5-star experience. Hoodlums is the ultimate music/cd/vinyl/DVD/used music store in the Valley. ZIA and Stinkweeds are a distant second in terms of selection, price and overall experience. Steve and Kristian are two of the nicest local business owners Ive ever met. They know a ton about music and the local scene. Theyll help you find anything you need. Tucked in the SW corner of Guadalupe and McClintock (next to Traders Joes), this is a special place to find that CD/DVD youve been waiting to purchase.  They also have a wide selection of used CDs and DVDs to are at bargin prices, be sure to check that out too!"
1,"Im sorry. Youre too busy to look up my club card information? Too busy too push the button to do the search, enter my phone number and click ok? I took the time once upon whenever to sign up for your card. And now, you cant take 5 seconds to look it up for me? Let me clue you in, the cashiers here have always looked it up. It always takes 5-10 seconds at most! Great customer service. Insert sarcasm here for the uneducated. Other Big Lots this hasnt been a problem. Just the one."
2,"It was an OK gyro for almost twice as much as the other places Ive been to. It had a ridiculous amount of mutton sausage (thats what ""gyro meat"" is, fwiw,) and was pretty tasty, but not as good as a $4 gyro at Ali Baba. The price you pay for location, I guess. This would have gotten three stars, but then it gave me indigestion all day and I couldnt eat dinner, so it loses some for that."
5,I recently stayed at the Sheraton for two nights while attending a conference in Phoenix. I was blown away by the services. This is by far the best service I have received while staying at a hotel in recent years. I received a room on the 15 floor. Room was what you expect from Sheraton. The view from the room really sucked!! I got the room with a view of the hotel satellite and communications towers. TV quality was good and room had Starbucks coffee. Room also came with a refrigerator. I would like to see Sheraton move to Nespresso machines. After a long day attending a conference was great to relax at the hotel lobby bar. The desserts are yummy. I didnt get a chance to try the restaurants in the hotel. Hooters and Starbucks are directly across the street. My work colleague used the gym. He said the pool was really nice and gym had everything you need. Next time!!! I would definitely stay here again!!
5,"Does anyone know why their regular subs are $1 more than all the other Jimmy Johns? Or is that just when its delivered, instead of charging a standard delivery fee? Ive noticed that with the other types of sandwiches too, and extras...the slim is $4 instead of $3.25, and extra avo is $1.75 instead of $0.75 Thats not going to stop me from ordering though :-) Still love their sandwiches...they make the best veggie sub Ive had. They load it up with veggies, whereas I have to ask for extra everything at a certain other sub chain and then they still barely put any on. Id much rather pay a little bit extra for Jimmy Johns :-)"
4,"As my roomies put it: ""Finally a Thai place in Mesa that I actually like."" ""This tastes like my Moms Thai restaurant in Utah."" Three of my roomies and I ordered the Panang Curry with Beef, Red Curry with Chicken, Tom Yum Koong, Spicy Chicken and 4 Thai Iced Teas. The curry was the right consistency, not watered down and too thick. And the best part was that it was just deeelish! What is great about this place is that the spices dont overpower the dish, and you can taste many different flavors with each bite. This little place seats under 16 people max. Its a definite mom and pops store that makes tasty and very reasonable priced meals. We chatted how we wish we hit this place up sooner because its one of the best tasting ones in the Phoenix area."
4,"This place defies being stuck in a single category. Their menu is a bit eclectic and my only regret is not getting to try more of it. This place was right around the corner from my hotel on a recent business trip. We liked it so much, we ate here a couple of times. Im sorry Alex P. felt that he was getting attitude. One of my coworkers asked if he could have the daily special from the previous day because he had liked it so much. They told him it wouldnt be a problem and fixed it right up for him. The food was good and reasonably priced. I was there in April and enjoyed getting to sit outside on their patio and enjoy the awesome weather."
5,"Even though the new place is limited on seating the food more than makes up the difference.   I took my wife and kids for lunch.  We had some pulled pork and beef brisket sandwiches, fresh made slaw, and mac and cheese made from scratch like mom used to make.  The kids gobbled up the mac and cheese.  The meat was definately cooked with love.   Gradys makes their own signature sauce in several varieties.  They sell bottles of it as well.  I liked mixing the Hot with the Super Hot to make that pork melt that much better in my mouth. I also noticed they do catering.  Ive had events catered by some other BBQ joints before, but this food is much better quality and I think I can woo the crowds with Gradys BBQ. I fully recommend stopping into my new favorite barbeque place in Arizona. Thanks for making good food Grady.  We all enjoyed it and writing this made me hungry for more."
3,"I hate being disappointed by bars bragging about their ""huge"" number of taps... while I cant dispute that they have 52 beers on tap, I can tell you that very few of them are worth drinking.. and that the prices here are on the ok to high side... I would never come back if its not happy hour or late night pricing. I asked general questions about not discounted pricing, nine dollars for a Manhattan made with Jack Daniels and beers ranging from five to seven dollars... if Im paying seven bucks for a pint at a sports bar in Tempe it had better be something from Russian River or a Stone anniversary brew... and a nine dollar Manhattan seems out of place... this isnt Scottsdale or a hotel bar.    Well the good news, Thirsty Lion is quite lovely inside, plenty of seating and dim lights, really not a bad place to relax and mellow out. Plus, the food was great, everything weve had has been very tasty, now its all been off of the happy hour menu, but thats the only time Ill probably be here, the scotch eggs are delicious and my main recommendation. Im hoping that in time prices will drop a bit and more craft breweries will get represented, but aside from the nice interior and spot on happy hour menu, Thirsty Lion just doesnt stand out enough to steal me away from Boulders or Taste of Tops..."
4,"I am excited about this place, even though I have not had many opps to try northern style Chinese food.  Think dough, and dont mistakenly believe its the same dough steam/cooked/fried/stuffed in different ways.   The kind owner lady proudly told me each of our 3 dishes was made w/ a unique dough recipe...  At first I was worried all the dough would overpower my tastebuds, until I asked for some dipping sauce... they kindly made me a black vinegar, ginger, and scallion sauce... that just upleveled everything.  Who knows if its traditional or not, but I implored the owner to start dishing this out when Americans like me (smiley face) come over and eat. The off-menu items are written on a small whiteboard sitting atop the freezer stuffed w/ to-go dumplings... luckily the folks there speak English, so Ill be working my way thru this secret menu and who knows.. this might go 5 stars! SW corner of Ray and Alma School, next to the JCC."
3,"I am a BIG fan of chicken and waffles and I will try it just about anywhere it is served.  I especially love it in the morning; when everyone else is ordering a light breakfast, expect me to go for the fried chicken. Lo-Los was just alright for me.   I liked the chicken, but I was not fond of the waffles.  They were a little too... thin?  Light?  I dunno how to describe it, but I like my chicken AND my waffles to have a little crunch.  And there was kind of an interesting taste to the waffles.  I cant put my finger on the flavor. I liked the atmosphere okay, but I probably wont be back. I know Mrs. Whites Golden Rule Cafe is not for everyone, but honestly I prefer the feel there.  It feels less ""affected"" by its customers, I guess.  For some reason I am finding it hard to come up with the words here, but Lo Los feels like it is the more popular cousin of Mrs. Whites... you know... the one with the Letter in Football. Anyway, I am glad Lo-Los is thriving...  Maybe I will try the Scottsdale location sometime to see if they have a different spin on things."
3,"While throwing a small get together, we were able to have a back patio with a buffet style table set up with some pretty tasty appetizers.  The chicken sqewers were delicious and smoked salmon was also tasty but something seemed to lack.  At the end of the day it was good and I wouldnt hesitate to go back, but nothing to make me a raving fan."
4,"Service, awesome.  Food, spectacular.  Price, unbeatable.  I cant tell you how many times this restaurant has saved my life.  Richard is very understanding when I come in completely hung over, and knows to put extra kimchi in my side dishes.   Also, in terms of the local ""$20 all you can eat"" sushi specials, this is the only place that ever pops into my head as  a place I need to go.  Their sushi chef if spectacular and super friendly so its always a nice time sitting at the bar. They have a special lunch menu that is served only during the week, so you can expect the dinner menu on Saturday and Sunday regardless of the time you go.  Both menus are amazing, its just that the menus are slightly different in their options so if you have a specific craving (and I often do) you might have to concede to something different once you get there.  Its mildly annoying, but the food never disappoints so I let it go. Try it, you wont be disappointed."
5,"The food is fantastic, the staff is helpful and the atmosphere is comfortable.  The food at El Bravo just tastes better than the food at any other Mexican restaurant I have been to in Phoenix, regardless of price. The cheese is amazing!  I love their flour tortilla flautas , crispy beef tacos, cheese crisps, enchiladas (I could go on and on).  I really can see no reason to go anywhere else in Phoenix for Mexican food.  I highly recommend El Bravo."
3,"For some reason or another this macys has a better selection of shoes than the one at Scottsdale mall. In the past year I found a pair of Calvin Klein sandals for half off, and they carry the higher end, younger brands- which is great Nordstroms selection tends to be for an older crowd."
4,"A bit pricey, yet one of the best breakfast sandwiches you will find.  Parking is slim."
4,"Let me first start off by saying I was skeptical.  I had no idea what to expect and after reading a ton of reviews, we thought we would give it a shot.  Located in an old converted home in Heritage Park right across from Pizzeria Bianco the place is small and intimate and just an experience in and of itself. Now for the food.  Where do I begin?  Tapas (small plates) style, and community (share) the experience is in ordering from each section of the menu. We started with the Kimci and Nasu.  The Kimci is a Napa cabbage cold plate that will rock your world; a little sweet, a little spicy it was a great way to start.   The Nasu is an eggplant with a bacon marinade of sorts on top and while I am describing it poorly it was truly delishous.  Amazing!! Next was the Yellowtail Ceviche.  This WAS OUT OF THIS FING WORLD.  Inexplicable but so, SO GOOD.   Next was 2 off the menu plates, chicken and Wagyu beef short ribs.  The ONLY REASON this place does not get 5 stars is 2 of the 3 different types of chicken were mediocre.  The wasabi grilled chicken was pure wasabi on grilled chicken.   The 2nd was a panko fried chicken, which was moist and delishous but nothing amazing, HOWEVER the 3rd chicken was an orange peel fried chicken that way just so good beyond words. Lastly, the Wagyu beef short ribs were so so so amazing, I mean, I never wanted the taste to leave my mouth. The service, very good Juan (our server) was very attentive and very helpful as it was our first time there...but it most definitely will not be our last...oh and THEY VALIDATE FOR PARKING ;)"
2,"With regard to AMber W.s points 1. Im rating the food not the containers or the owners 2. If it makes you feel better eating subpar food because of the American Spirit so be it. Others of us are more concerned with the food itself. 3. Im not downgrading it because its not a sit down restaurant. Even among non-sit down restaurants or ""fast food"" style Indian themed eateries, this place is subpar. Ive eaten at quick Indian eateries and they are much better than this. 4. My review is for people who understand and can appreciate good Indian food. Its not for people who value text service, nice containers and chatty owners. 5. I want to support mom and pop and locally owned restaurants but I also want to support good ones and not encourage bad ones to emerge simply because there is no competition for Indian themed restaurants here."
5,"Just open.  I had the roast beef sandwich and my wife had the turkey and stuffing sandwich.  Both were excellent, modern interpretations on classic lunches.  I highly reccommend this place. P.S.:  iPad driven POS system is way cool."
4,"Hey Guys,  This place is awesome....but I could be jaded because of all the wonderful wines I sampled! From the gris, cabs, sparkling shiraz, riesling to the chardonnay, this shop had what we were looking for and what we werent looking for! The atmosphere was amazing and quiet for a Thursday night get together. Our hostess was sweet and doted to our every need. The food was amazing. I completely recommend the crocodile pot stickers.  For exotic wines and exotic meats appetizers, look up Down Under Wines!"
4,"Every once in a while, you just need to enjoy good southern cooking. I was taken to Lo-los while visiting Phoenix. The Sweet Tea is served in a mason jar and comes with a diabetic attack. I had the Betty Bop - fried chicken breast and waffle. The waffle was really the stand out portion of the meal, but the two did work together. You dont have to get the chicken and waffle combo. But come on, dont be like that. We went Friday before lunch, and we were sitting and eating in 10 minutes, but from the looks of the other reviews, that isnt normal."
5,How could you write a bad review about a mountain?  Great sight to see.
4,"Clean facility, prices are super low! You cant go wong with saving money!"
5,"General Manager Scott Petello is a good egg!!! Not to go into detail, but let me assure you if you have any issues (albeit rare) speak with Scott and treat the guy with some respect as you state your case and Id be surprised if you dont walk out totally satisfied as I just did. Like I always say..... ""Mistakes are inevitable, its how we recover from them that is important""!!! Thanks to Scott and his awesome staff. Youve got a customer for life!! .......... :^)"
4,"Food is whatevers, drinks the same. However, this DnB compared to the one in Tempe is much better if youre really just interested in getting some game time in. The on at Tempe Marketplace is crazy busy, like 11 people waiting in line to play basketball crazy. When I go to an arcade and am already dropping 20+ bucks to play games I want that gaming experience to be nonstop. However, the drive is really far for someone that lives in Gilbert... so thats really the only reason why it gets a 4 star."
4,"Never had a bad meal. Just this week had the halibut ceviche special and as always the best guacamole (especially if you like garlic). The green chile stew was good, although I would have liked a bit more kick. Dined in the patio for the first time and it was great atmosphere. However it was a bit humid. Still a great experience."
1,"So a friend of mine went here last Friday, and they were double charged.  The bartender took advantage of the situation and threw out the receipt to avoid cancelling the $60 amount. Which she claims and assumes was her tip (on a $60 bill). ""I get a 100% tips!"" umm..yeah.. I think I will skip this place for sure!"
5,"This is one excellent Ethiopian restaurant, rivals anything Ive sampled in Washington DC or Seattle.  If I lived in Phoenix, this would be a Top-5 restaurant for me (along with Lo-Los Chicken & Waffles - yum!). Lalibela takes a slightly different approach to their menu.  Many of the entrees are offered as small portions ($4.50-$6.00 each).  They suggest each diner order 2-3 of these to make a meal. Kitfo and Lamb Tibs dishes are offered as full entrees and like many Ethiopian restaurants, you can order combo plates (meat combo, veggie combo, house combo plate etc.).  This made deciding on our meal a little more complicated, but also offered more flexibility for sampling different dishes. Our favorite dish ordered was the Lamb Tibs (the spicy version with Awaze spice paste).  Lamb was soooo tender, and the spices were a delight - rich in flavor but not too hot for those with tame palettes.  Good thing it comes as a full order - four of us were competing for bites!!  We ordered a half portion of Keye Wott (beef in a spicy brown sauce) that was some of the best Ive ever had.  Again, rich in flavor but not too spicy.  My favorite Ethiopian meat dish is Kitfo - choice beef sort of like steak tartar (servered raw or lightly cooked) but with Ethiopian spices.  Lalibelas was pretty good, just not transcendent like the Lamb Tibs or Beef Keye Wott.  The vegetable dishes were on a whole excellent - especially the yellow lentils, gomen (collard greens) and spicy (Wott) lentils. Staff was great - attentive, helpful service.  Unlike some Ethiopian restaurants, this one is very user-friendly.  Although in some cases  the menu accommodates American tastes it doesnt compromise on quality or authenticity.  One note on the injera (sponge-like bread used to scoop up the entrees) - its a mix of wheat flour and teff (a grain indigenous to Ethiopia) and I dont think its fermented like injera that is made with 100% teff.  Im used to the latter, but you can argue Lalibelas injera doesnt compete with the flavor of the entrees as much. All in all, one of the best Ethiopian restaurants Ive been to, and I have been to many in the States.  Only problem now is whether my favorite Ethiopian restaurants in Seattle will still taste as good!  Highly, highly recommended."
5,Being from Sweden you just like salmon and at Le Chalet you can get a delicous Nordique Crepe with salmon! Never had anything like that in Sweden! Besides the great crepe and friendly service from the owner Alain Keller I was also treated to a laughing experience. They have a comedy show twice a month. Great place to eat and have a nice relaxed evening!
5,"If youve never had or even heard of bingsoo you NEED to check this place out. I have two friends who were constantly bantering about bingsoo and this Fresco place. I was excited when I found out it was so close to my house. If youve never heard of it, this is how it goes down. Its a layer of shaved ice, then you have your choice of ice cream or FF frozen yogurt, your choice of fresh fruit off the menu (apples, strawberry, mango, banana kiwi and many others) and then your choice of ""sauce"" which is a fruit puree of either strawberry, kiwi or mango and honey. You mix it all together and there you have it. A somewhat healthy dessert! They even have a frequent bingsoo buyers card =)  This place isnt just all about the bingsoo though. They have a menu of fresh sandwiches and fruit juices too!"
1,"Im going to have to agree Whole heartedly. And i informed the manager of it as well. I picked this one because it was close to the Airport and the Light Rail. The noise from the Airport wasnt to bad. But it was the Train Horns all NIGHT LONG and ALL MORNING when your trying to sleep. I wouldnt pick this one, the neighborhood wasnt bad despite what people say. But the Train noise is just unbearable. I got it for the Click 6 rate which was reasonable. Stay Elsewhere. I should of picked one further down that was right off the light rail."
5,"Feeling yucky one day and wanting nothing but some reminders of my bay area asian food... My search began with my iPhone for Pho.. AND I wanted good Pho.. (Im skeptical of some dishes in the desert, just sayin!).. I drove a good 20min from my loft to find this place.. worth it. Usual toppings you will find with real Vietnamese Pho.. but awesome! I asked for a variety of tofu and seafood.. I couldnt finish it all.. but never can with Pho.. its a big bowl, and filling!  Extras on tables to get your Pho on..  Ordered the Vietnamese Shrimp Rolls too.. left feeling not so stuffy! AND full.. OH yeah, and I still had money for a bit of shoe shopping the next day... :-)"
5,"Love me some hidden house!  The music is too loud. The drinks too cheap. The clientele too local. But Ive never had anything but a good time there. Whether its karaoke or weird shit on the weekends youll have fun if you dont expect it to be Merc, cuz Merc it aint. And not for one moment in its life has it pretended to be. But I love it for what it is and thats an experience."
1,"This review is based on delivery, service and food quality as delivered. Second and last time I will be ordering from this place. The first time they forgot a few items and were very off for delivery time.  Tonight I Ordered at 11:03 PM, estimated delivery at 11:50 updated to 11:54 PM (from a whopping 1.5 miles away to add). 11:54 comes and goes. Call them, at 12:07 AM now, I am told they are on their way (1.5 miles away keep in mind). Call back at 12:40 AM to cancel my order as I do not want to eat at 1:00 AM. They actually come to deliver while I am on hold waiting at 12:44 AM. My ""hot sub"" is ice cold, theres nothing like the taste of cold greasy bacon and chicken close to 1:00 AM on a Monday (now Tuesday) night...if you are going to take nearly 2 hours to deliver this, at least make sure the temperature is somewhat close to where it is supposed to be....never again silver mine...never again. This place probably has a ""good taste potential"". Unfortunately, like most ""hot food"" the taste quality substantially decreases the longer it sits...in a fridge, alley, or wherever they decided to leave it for nearly 2 hours. If you feel the need to get food from here..for the love of sub kings please just DONT GET DELIVERY!"
4,"We were staying at a hotel nearby and found the reviews for this spot. Boy are we glad that we did! We are constantly on the hunt for great tacos in any city, this was definitely one for our list.  We ate here for dinner both nights we were in town. The majority of the meals ordered were the 3 taco plates. One carne asada, marinated pork, and carnitas, served with yummy rice and beans- the tortillas were very good too. This is definitely the plate to get here. I think that the carne asada ones were the best.  Normally we order all of our food medium spiced, but beware of the red hot sauce that they put on the tacos. My daughter somehow got an extra dose on her tacos and was having a hard time getting through the burn. This somehow justified the obscene amount of Frescas ordered. :) If you are remotely sensitive to heat, order your sauce on the side."
5,"Huge store, friendly staff"
5,"This is an adorable little gallery located in the middle of nowhere, Downtown Phoenix.  My art teacher friend got fixated on bringing me here when she heard me complaining about Phoenix being chain hell (and thanks to her and Yelp, I dont believe that anymore).  I think she chose wisely as I loved this little space.   It was a nice place to stop and check out, and then of course we had lunch at the attached City Bakery.  A perfect activity for a half-day of school!  Hooray creativity and uniqueness!"
4,"I like Pei Wei, its good when I want something fast. But the main reason for my review on here today was to say HOW AMAZING the manager was at this location.  I came in at lunch and it was VERY busy. There was a line to the door. There were some arguments about someone stealing a seat (unhappy customer, complaining because a seat was saved and they had waited in line, wanted to be comped because of it.... so dumb if you ask me. I mean just deal with it people! Its busy!) But the manager dealt with it so professionally, and when I was next in line he did not act rushed, he was very helpful, and told me that if I did not like what I ordered to just tell him and he would get me something new. I work in the restaurant business (a much higher priced place) and this manager was awesome! Good job man!"
3,"This was supposed to be my trip to have the best pizza in America. So imagine my disappointment that they dont even serve it at lunch. What human who eats pizza thinks it should only be served at dinner?  Whaaat?  I have since been kindly corrected by another yelper that this restaurant isnt the pizzeria. My party was confused, since the server said they DO serve pizza...at dinner. The soprassata focaccia sandwich was fine, but overpriced by about $3.  I dont live here to try it again, so the first impression is the only impression. Ill leave it to all you foodie hipsters to prop up the rating."
5,Love it!!! Wish we still lived in Arizona as Chino is the one thing we miss. Every time I think about Chino Bandido my mouth starts watering. If I am ever in the state again I will drive out of my way just to go to it again. YUMMY!
5,"Lets see...what is there NOT to like about Surprise Stadium? Well, $9.50 tall cans of PBR is about all I could come up with and thats not a surprise (pun intended) considering youre attending a sporting event...even spring training.  But as someone who does not living in Arizona, and as someone who doesnt go to MLB baseball games in Southern California due to the fact it costs so damn much, people bitching about the slow service or any other little inconvenience when it comes to seeing a game here. Look, youre lucky enough to have almost an entire month of low cost MLB baseball right in your back yard. If I could, Id live down here during March just to take in the awesome baseball action that crisscrosses the Phoenix metro area each year.  I attended my first spring training game on March 12th, 2012 at Surprise Stadium as the Royals took on the San Francisco Giants (my favorite team). Our seats (Sec. 112, Row J, Seats 13-14-15) were 25 bucks each (around 30 bucks including service fees). I mean, we were maybe 5 or 6 rows back from the Giants dugout (check out some of my pictures). The stadium (funny calling it that since it only holds just over 10,000 people) is big enough so you feel youre at an MLB game but small enough to feel pretty close and intimate with the players. The stadium is well maintained and kept super clean.  Arriving to the park, I was surprised (pun unintended) to see that parking was free, an oddity when going to an event like this. The stadium staff, as mentioned by other reviews, are mainly made up of senior citizens who were super friendly and helpful. I didnt have to wait long at the concession stands, even if lines were a bit long. The outfield is lined with a lawn area, perfect for people to sit back and have a picnic while taking in a game (Tickets are around 9 bucks each after service fees!!!).  I love this place and hope to return next year when visiting family. Oh, Giants won 2-1! Go Giants!!!"
4,"I like these sort of ""mom & pop"" spots, small and intimate setting.  Great pizza!  I always enjoy the veggie pizza with jalapenos, oh so good!  And mu hubby loves the suicide wings, but weve tried almost everything off of the menu and you CANNOT go wrong.  Prices rock too!"
4,"Yum!  even though it is incredibly heavy and bad for you- YUM.  we got the beef and hominy stew with fry bread and the ultimate taco.  lets start with the stew- though it was just beef and hominy, the broth was so tasty and delicious.  didnt even need the fry bread on the side.  the ultimate taco was pretty awesome- we got the red beef chili and then it had refried beans, cheese, sour cream, and lettuce.  it definitely wasnt gourmet but it was so delicious and so cheap!  gluttonous, but worth it.  we wanted to get a dessert fry bread, but we were just way too full to even go there."
1,"As I promised myself, Id go back again to try it again. Yyyeeaahhhh...sooooo....the food is still not good. I got the mongolian beef and its like ""wha? really? is this IRL?""  Im a chinese food kind of a fan, this restaurant, Im not a fan of."
4,"If your going to see the Phoenix Coyotes at Jobing.com arena.....or the Arizona Cardinals at the University of Phoenix stadium....then you you cant really miss the experience that is the Westgate City Center. Now it is not a spectacular mall by any means...and the parking is a bit confusing...but it does have its own flair and style. During the summer months it is the perfect place to go after a game or event at the stadiums...because you can grab some dinner....a drink...take a nice walk....or just hang out and watch the stars in the beautiful skies over Glendale Arizona.  The best part about all of this along with the close proximity to the stadiums.....is the parking is FREE....cant beat that. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"
5,"I love this Gelato! My favorite combination is the panna cotta with the mint chocolate chip. Weird but wonderful. I am rarely down this way, especially since Ive moved, but I still fantasize about digging in to this deliciousness!   I only ever had great service, and fantastic product here. So far it is the best Gelato Ive had, although I hear Arlecchinos is pretty fantastic as well. I miss visiting Angel Sweet, I will have to go back soon."
5,"Tucked on the western edge of the Foothill Acres neighborhood in North Phoenix or what I would call ""The Slope"", Try Me Bicycle Shop has been in business for nearly 40 years and has been collecting the odd part for every type of bike over that time.  The showroom is filled with cruisers and comfort bikes, new and used. No high end bikes here but they do have an inventory of old and hard-to-find parts, good service and free air that makes this place."
1,I went there with a friend last year after reading so many good reviews. The service is good. We didnt have to wait but I didnt like the food I ordered. I had a salmon with caper butter sauce. The fish is not fresh at all and the food is too geasy for me.
5,"Going to Desert Botanical Garden is the perfect field trip for a beautiful day like today... Ive been to DBG a handful of times for events, exhibit openings, meetings, and of course Yelp In Bloom (a yelper party that I planned a couple of years ago)... but today I went with my son and we met some other friends with the sole purpose of checking out the butterfly exhibit. We didnt get lucky enough to have a butterfly land on us, but we did see tons of gorgeous butterflies.  There were orange butterflies and yellow butterflies and striped butterflies, etc... The flowers in the pavillion are pretty to look at as well.  We visited the gift kiosk afterward and took home a butterfly finger puppet, which I know we will get tons of use from (only $6.25). The exhibit runs until May 13th, so dont miss it! And if you do find yourself with more time while youre there, definitely check out the design for a living world exhibit as well... I saw that when it first opened and it was really cool.  The photography alone is worth a visit. I just wish I had more time to explore DBG more often!"
3,"Weve been in the market looking for a church for the family to start attending. Chandler Christian seemed to be a nice offering since they are located fairly close to the house and have a decent size to offer something for each group (parents & children).  Ive gotten some good reviews from a family that I know that attends.  I LOVE that they have a service on Saturday, as that is ALWAYS a plus for me. The sermon for today was an interesting one, and it seemed to be relevant and on topic for today.  The pastor took an updated slant to the story to make it a bit more relevant to todays time.  My husband was even laughing at the pastors jokes.  My mother-in-law even commented on how she liked the music.  I did notice that the verses that they pulled up were not the verses that I remember.  I believe its due to them using a different version. All of this being said, the service seemed to be a good one. The signage indicated that this was non-denomination; however, the service reminded me one Baptist services from childhood."
4,"Now accepts plastic!  Now accepts plastic!  Did you hear me?  Harveys now accepts plastic! Ive lived around the corner from Harveys for a little over 4 years now.  I had lunch there once in the mid 1990s, and went in to watch a Suns playoff game a few years back when my friend was decked out in Spurs gear and we were nearly lynched at Half Moon.  Quick lunch with a girlfriend who was in the mood for a burger about a year ago.   While I love, and I do mean LOVE a good dive bar, this place scared the crap out of me.  Im young, not hideous, female, and not of the meth-head variety - so not only did I not blend, but I felt targeted.  Sad, really.  The ONE bar within easy drunk stumbling distance from my house, and I wasnt happy going there.  During a weekday for lunch was more or less okay.  But evenings are when the freaks come out.  And I dont mean the freaks like me.  I mean the dangerous crazy ones - not just the fun crazy ones.  Theres a difference! Well, enter the new roommate.  He was disinclined to believe my review, and insisted we go.  I resisted until late Saturday night, when he came home at 1am and insisted I get dressed so we could go there for an hour.  Maybe I was tired.  Maybe I needed a change of pace.  Whatever the reason, I gave in, got dressed and we walked over to Harveys. YAY!  According to Echo, the bartender (yes, its her real name.  her parents are hippies like mine), the owner has been working hard to improve the place (read: clientele) for over a year.  It shows!   Echo is three shades of awesome - the perfect gal to be running the bar!  Easy smile, quick wit, great sense of humor and the talent to mix a great drink while cooking any of the grub from the menu.  She is a one woman show and pulls it off like a champ! June drink specials included $2.00 Beam 5 Star bourbon, Yukon Jack, and I dont remember what else.  I asked for a bourbon and coke, the roommate asked for his bourbon neat.  (Brave - cheap bourbon *needs* to be cut with something!).  The pour is solid and consistent  Oh, and did I mention you can get a mixed drink, anytime day or night for just two bucks?  For $2!! Two drinks for me, two shots for him, a beer chaser for him and a cheese wineburger split between us.  Under $14!!  Holy hell, its cheaper to drink here than it is at home! And at home - we dont have the entertainment of the other patrons.  Like Cowboy who would do the splits on demand.  And suggest my roommate go through the needed steps for a game of ""rodeo"" with his girlfriend. You just cant make this up! Oh - and he bestowed slightly drunk me with a new nickname. Apparently, I am a ""prick ass bitch.""  I dont know how he meant it, but I am taking it as a compliment and will wear it with pride! Oh, yes.  I will certainly be back!  A LOT."
2,"Gary Betz, DDS with Southwest Dental Group in Phoenix (Ahwatukee) Dr. Betz was nice, but the office...well it seemed to be the unfriendliest, coldest dental office Ive ever been to (out of 6-7 in my lifetime). I used to complain that dentists offices were too full of perky, chatty, overly friendly clones, but now I miss those offices. I saw nary a smile or warm greeting - businesslike efficiency seems to be the norm here. Dr. Betz was friendly and smiled, however. No complaints about him, other than my feeling that everything was rushed. We didnt go over my history or much of anything, but well see if the next visit is better.  Postscript: After getting home from this appt. and reading the horror stories on various review sites relating to ALL Southwest Dental offices, I changed my designated dentist and went to Foothills Smiles instead. Please see my review of Foothills Smiles on Ray Rd."
5,"I have lived all over the US, and I have experienced extreme lows and highs with dentists, but this dental group is by far my favorite I have ever been a patient of. I cant say enough good about them, so I wont ramble.... Just love them."
5,"I honestly have only positive things to say about Postinos since every one of my visits here has been very pleasant. From the valet who is running his ass off to the food and everything in between, this place does it all right! If you go here hungry, you should know that your options are basically a panini, a salad or some bruschetta. Ive had a little bit of everything and for the value and quality you cant go wrong the the bruschetta. I recently determined my favorite to be the ricotta, dates and pistachio but a close second is the salami and pesto. Wine by the glass can be a bit steep so if youre planning to stay for a bit and can agree on a style with your company, you might be better off getting a bottle. A bottle is pretty much 3x the price of a glass so you end up getting 1 1/2 glasses extra. Bonus! Someday, Ill actually take advantage of their $20 deal for wine and bruschetta!"
3,"This was the perfect place for the family after a day at the resort.  The food was good, especially the barbeque chicken.  The kids menu was wonderful.  My only complaint was that the server really could not answer questions about the menu."
4,"This was our third visit and I have to say the service is impeccable. They are attentive, friendly and helpful.  I cant remember what we had our first visit, it was right after they opened and during the awkward stage. The second visit we had pizza it was good, we were looking for deep dish which they dont make but it was good and great service.  Tonight we all had different things: Mostaccioli for my older son he was very happy, cheesy and flavorful sauce. Spaghetti and meatball off the kids menu for the younger boy, sweet sauce and a big meatball another happy boy. Husband had the Chicago Grinder hot and it was gone in a flash and he said it was really good. It looked great on the toasted bread. He also got a salad instead of fries, lots of fresh veggies. I had the Italian Beef with peppers and onions, it comes with Giardiniera and au jus and french fries. The bread was yummy soft yet substantial enough to withstand au jus. The bread was stuffed, stuffed with meat, the peppers and onions were good but the giadiniera made it. It was a really good sandwich. San Tan Brewery on tap - yum. I could give them 5 stars but Ive had better Italian Beef though I will admit Im not an expert.  A great dinner and I hope to return soon."
5,"Kids love Disney, and so do I.  One of my favorite things at this location (as opposed to the AZ Mills location) is the magic princess mirror.  Grab any of the princess items (shoes, tiara, wand, etc) off the rack, and wave the package with the UPC symbol facing the jewels and mirror, and after a few seconds, that particular princess will appear in the mirror with a little story for the kids."
5,"Hertz Gold Club service worked perfectly for me. My Toyota Corolla, booked over the internet, was in its bay and ready to go. The buses to and from the rental centre were frequent and painless to use."
4,"Being a fan of the infamous Roscoes Chicken and Waffles in Long Beach, I was totally down for some chicken and waffles this morning. The bestie found this place because it was close to my new home in Arizona and was sure to be a hearty brekky after all the physical exertion of packing, moving and loading/unloading a Uhaul. So off we went... The place is easy to find and pleasant to walk into. The staff was friendly immediately upon arrival. Service was quick and attentive. The menu is simple but appealing...so are the prices. We decided to go with the traditional chicken and waffle plates to satisfy the savory and sweet tooth. Waffles are big, maple syrup is warm and the chicken is perfectly southern fried.  Im afraid I have to admit that I may now be thinking of LoLos first whenever I hear chicken and waffles. MmmMmm!"
1,"Let me first say that we are fans of the W Hotel and have stayed in many of their hotels around the nation and are overall happy with the accommodations and customer service.   Im a local Phoenician who resides in the Arcadia neighborhood and frequents many of the wonderful restaurants and hotels this City has to offer.  After hearing MANY negative reviews from co-workers, family, and friends, my fiancé and I decided to give the W Hotel Scottsdale a shot prior to forming an opinion of our own for this hotel/restaurant/bar. During a night out on the town with visiting and local friends, we opted to give this place a try.  Upon approaching the entrance of the bar, security tells us that were not welcome here due to one of the members of our party not having closed toe shoes and another not having a collared shirt.  The attire our group was wearing was more than appropriate for any Phoenix/Scottsdale restaurant/bar.  Let me remind you thats is July in Phoenix, and over one-hundred degrees at the time of night we went to the W and the six of us just finished a dinner at an adjacent, popular restaurant.  The staff was flat out rude to not only us, but others in line wanting and willing to spend money and support the local hotel. I will strongly suggest not staying here or supporting the quality of business they are running here.  During a time of a slowing economy and tourism, many businesses are forced to rely solely on the best possible customer service to attract and retain business--the W Hotel fell way short of this. I was very discouraged after our experience here and will agree with the many other reviewers that this place in not worth supporting.   Phoenix/Scottsdale has many great places to experience, so dont settle for this place."
5,"This place gets it right from the moment you walk in the door. Signed baseballs jerseys and bats by legends on the wall, a friendly host to greet you and when you sit down they ask if you want free chopped liver. It comes with bits of egg and onion, warm rye bread and bagel chips.  Our waiter, Jeff, was friendly and attentive, even lending us his flashlight to read an old newspaper story in the rafters. The cream of mushroom soup made from scratch was superb. Our mains were baby back ribs, the specialty of the house, cooked perfectly with a flavorful sauce. The broasted chicken was to die for: moist and juicy with a crispy outer skin. The fries were piping hot, as they should be. And the portions are beyond generous. We topped it off with key lime pie, light and tasty, an ideal complement to the meaty mains. And the bill was under $60, an amazing deal. As a bonus, some of the players drop in during spring training."
4,"This place is a good go to when youre looking for a mexican infused panda express.  Haha.  Yum!  I got the combo meal with the Jade Red chicken made into a quesadilla and the diablo chicken.  Really good!  I also got jerk fried rice.  The beans were also very good.  Yummy in my tummy.  I really enjoyed Chino Bandidos, but dont think I could go more than once during a trip to Phoenix (Id get very large from eating like this!).  :D  Oh yeah, if you want something more than a snack, dont just get a quesadilla by itself.  My poor brother thought the quesadilla would be huge and good enough for his dinner (thinking taqueria size), but it was pretty sad and small.  Luckily, my combo wasnt that small and I had extra food to share."
5,Yen has amazing sushi. I would say that they have the best sushi in AZ. You have to try it to see how amazing it is. The service is great and I feel like I just stepped into Japan. The whole sushi experience is very authentic and perfect place to hang out with friends or take a date :D There is only one thing I dont like. Sometimes it gets to busy so make sure to get there early (around 7 P.M) if you want to be seated right away.
3,"The pizza here is average. Its not bad, but its not the best pizza Ive ever had, either. Was it worth $9.75 for a 12"" personal pizza? No. I paid with a Fox Restaurants gift card, so I cant complain too much about a ""free for me"" meal. I would probably not come back again if it was on my dime. Also, my pizza was a little bit burnt on the crust. It was edible, but I was surprised that they served me slightly burnt pizza at the price of $9.75. My fiances wasnt-- in fact, they remade his entire pizza and didnt even send it out to us because it had a hole in the crust."
3,"We made the trek down from northern phoenix to get some authentic ramen.  I wanted to love this place and I wanted it to be worth the trip, but it just wasnt.  The decor is as previously described - you sort of time warp back to the 80s but it is clean and well loved by its owner.  They do have a lot of authentic menu items and a great kids meal, but the ramen was just not that good.  Its downfall was the broth.  Hubby got the salmon chirashi which was also not that fresh.  If Im in the area, I may give it another try for the don-buris."
5,"This is probably the sweet I crave the most! Salted Butter Caramel! Yummmm! When I cant make it up to Scottsdale, I stop by my local Whole Foods in Chandler and pick up a pint from the freezer section and it is just as good."
4,"This Gamestop is nicely stocked and it is very clean.  When I checked in here, I was picking up a copy of 007: Blood Stone.  It is currently on sale NEW for $9.99.  A fantastic price!   Heres the catch.  I tried their ""Pick-Up In Store"" service, in which you pick out the game online, you enter either your Rewards Card Number (which I have), or you enter your Credit Card number, just to make sure that you arent making a bogus claim.  Then you can go ahead and pick it up right away in store. BUT.  They gave me a USED copy of the game, and wanted to charge me $22.95!  Are you kidding?!  I just saw the ad online, and I reserved a NEW copy for $9.99.  The last thing I want is a colossal mix-up... I dont know how they could have messed this up.   This place would have gotten a 5 star rating, but with the colossal mess up with the pickup, I will only give them 4."
4,"A group of friends and I decided to check out Vincents Saturday Market this past weekend after a beautiful morning hike had worked up our appetites.  When we got there, the place was packed (but still had space to accomodate our group of 6).  It was the perfect outdoor market feel, with fresh vegetables from the garden available for purchase, next to organic lotions and soaps, and all sorts of food stands to whet any appetite (crepes, tacos, paninis, etc).  There was even a mimosa stand, where for $20 you could purchase a bottle of champagne, a glass of OJ, and as many plastic cups as needed.  This is definitely going to be added to my list of favorite places to enjoy a beverage while observing some extremely entertaining people watching!  I loved it, and hope to go again soon!"
1,"Cummings took over the company that we originally used, and since they have taken over we have had nothing but problems. I havent seen a single bug in years in my house and as soon as we started using Cummings weve found a bug almost every single day and not just bugs but cockroaches. I called Cummings to ask them about why this was happening and the receptionist was extremely rude saying they didnt do anything wrong. I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone.  Needless to say I will be finding a new pest control company today."
4,"Ive been to a few Schlotzkys around the valley and this one is actually surprisingly one of the nicer ones.  Its clean with plenty of space for even the largest working group lunch.  Service comes quick, and they have this southwestern sandwich that is great! If youre one of the many people who work for a large company on the Dunlap corporate freeway, this is not a bad place to grab a bite before the second half of your work day. One quick tip - its kind of tough to find, but its a stones throw north of Dunlap on the frontage rd.  You have to go back and around a building to find it though."
1,"Tried a couple Tammie Coe cupcakes and a mini muffin two weeks ago... Unfortunately for them, I also sampled Ollie Cakes... No wonder Ollie Cakes, aka Urban Cookie, won Cupcake Wars and Tammie Coe sits in high rent selling pretty sugar disguised as a cupcake. Drive a few miles north, get whatever the special cupcake of the day is along with a Brown Velvet and Lemon, and save saying you enjoyed Tammie Coe for impressing snooty folk who wouldnt know yummy if it bit them on the butt! Really, the TC cakes were just cakes... No flavor, no texture, dry... And I cant say how impressed I was that the clerk shoved all my selections into one, tiny, flat bag meant for cookies or sandwiches!  Apparently presentation and flavor preservation mean nothing... As their products now do, at least to me."
4,"Ill admit I almost fell outta my chair after hitting a triple-double on the Malibu. Quite generous pours plus delish menu. Cant wait to go back and try out the dance floor!!! Did I mention the Disco Ball?? Yeah, baby!"
4,"Sure, Ill pretend that the main reason I come here is the food and not the super cheap margaritas. It was the... uhh... food that is really good even if I dont remember what I ate. I think there were some fish tacos that were pretty tasty. Okay fine, I go for the margaritas- they are big, cheap and tasty."
3,"Im sad to say that I wasnt in love with MacAlpines.  The fact that the building has never been restored is cool, in a dirty kind of way.  The floors will never be clean enough, because they are so old.  That may seem ridiculous, but cleanliness is important to me when Im eating somewhere. Our server was odd, but helpful and attentive.  We spent a good amount of time oogling the random items displayed throughout and were entertained with our surroundings. The food is where I saw the problem- my Mac Cheeseburger was bland and tasteless.  My broccoli and cheese soup was below average.  I wasnt impressed one bit. We ended up having dessert.  I opted for a single scoop of Chocolate Malt Krunch, which Id never had before and didnt love (total personal preference as my friend loved it).  MacAlpines is cool, but I think purely as a place to get something sweet."
4,"Had a very nice meal in there on 5/10. Bengan bartha was tasty and the only poor part of the meal were the nan breads, they were not at all fresh. Good prices though and good service and Fullers ESB to boot!!"
2,"This place bothers me.  I already everything about country so going to these kind of places freaks me out.  I was forced to go here because the boyfriends parents were in town and they choose Cadillac Ranch due to their type of ""cuisine"". I have to say the foo d wasnt bad.  Server messed up my order but when they got it right it was ok.  I will not go here again however.  Sorry."
5,"I dig the breakfast been to 7th and 38th and had Nans breakfast, Plus have had tamales too so really is something to come back. In 13-years (I live in Cali) been here 26 times and not fancy (although 7th is the one with great pottery and colors inside. I ate 1 time for lunch of dinner and 25 times for brekafast"
5,"I had lunch there recently and was very impressed with the food,  friendly service and excellent value.  I had a lunch special -- two cheeseburger sliders with sweet potato fries.  They serve the burgers with several pieces of fresh crisp lettuce, tomato and onion.  We will definitely go there again."
3,"In the office, Fiesta Burrito is aptly known as ""across the street.""  Kind of like, ""How about across the street?""  ""Yeah, I could do across the street, today.""  If I ever said, ""How about Fiesta Burrito?""  I would get, ""Wheres that?""  Then I would have to say, ""You know, across the street.""  And the response would be, ""Well, why didnt you say so in the first place."" The primary reason we eat at ""across the street"" is because it is convenient - its across the street.  And in the immortal words of my most quotable co-worker, ""It is fast, cheap, and good -- no questions asked.""  The part about it being good is debatable.  I could do with a little less greasy.  Fast, no question.  And despite that fact that ""across the street"" charges 60 cents for spicy carrots now, the prices are low.  I like the chorizo plate with a side of sour cream, although I might start branching out as we eat at ""across the street"" way too much, and Im getting tired of always having the same thing. At just above a dive, I would call it a hole in the wall, but really, it is just a generic Mexican joint that hides in plain sight.  Even the name is rather plain as no one can seem to remember it.  There is a smallish, generic inside dining area, which is accompanied by a small, generic patio for outside dining.  Some high school students seem to come by for lunch leave.  The staff is polite.  Until they move or I no longer work across the street, Ill be a regular."
1,"So far my restaurant experience in Phoenix has been subpar when it comes to service and this one took the cake. Everytime the server came to our table it was just to do one thing and we would be left in the lurch with our mouths silenced in the middle of asking for something. Finally the food came and it was actually quite delicious, I ordered the turkey eggs benedict with potatoes and fresh fruit. However once again the food was dropped off with no silverware, no condiments and no refills on the coffee. I truly hope the restaurant re-trains the staff or hires a whole new batch, because I am afraid food alone can not keep a business afloat."
4,"Been there many times with many friends, not fancy food but decent, fresh, local, organic at a good price with none of the pretentions that one would associate with the whole organic/green mocvement in dining. That being said the food only gets 4 stars based on the price plus the 5 star brownies...food is above average but not by much, the atmosphere and price are what i enjoy most"
5,"I am disabled with MS. The heat of summer about does me in, esp. in the car. Because of this, and because the best thing Ive ever done for myself was to buy an electric Hamilton-Beach water kettle, I drink TEA. All day. Loads of it. Teavana is MUCHO EXPENSIVE, though I adore it. I learned of the Tea District through somebodys ad and like them very much as well. But, I had no idea we had a genuine tea company in Phoenix. And because of HomeRun, I was allowed to buy THREE vouchers. And because DragonFly is so awesome, they let me use all three to buy tea online and have it shipped to me all at once to avoid huge s&h fees. It should be here any day, and I cant wait to try their Cab(ernet) against Teavanas Opus Rouge. I love red heavily tart, fruity teas. It doesnt matter to me if there is no white, green, or black tea in it. In fact, I prefer it to just be the fruit. I drink it hot, and then as it cools all day in my tea pot, I keep refilling and either warm each huge travel mug with lid in the microwave, or drink it room temp, or even add some ice if it is particularly strong. I can EASILY drop $150 at Teavana, or $120 at Tea District and just touch on what I most want. With your three vouchers worth $60, I got to try two bags of every flavor I most wanted, except Peach (as they are out of it, but Holly wrote me several times and made recommendations based on what I had in my cart).   I know I will love it, and go back to order the Peach when it is in stock again. Thank you so much for finding a local treasure and making it accessible.   Sincerely,   Judith Ann Hillard President of Addiction Overcome, Inc., a non-profit foundation Author of The Other Woman at the Well www.addictionovercome.com"
2,"I planned to order chocolate truffles from Truffle Trolley for our wedding favors.  We ordered the sample box to try them out.  They came in about a week and they were packed on ice which was really nice.  However, when we tried them, we just found them WAY too sweet!  We didnt like them so we are looking for something else.  Just make sure you try the chocolate before you buy to make sure you like it."
4,"This place has good fast food, its always clean, and the staff is super nice. SUPER nice.  My kids love the play area and its a lot cleaner than any other fast food play area for sure. We love this place."
3,"We had a large group and they honored our reservation with having the tables ready at our specified time as opposed to getting them ready when we arrived. We had a somewhat set menu.  The tofu dumplings were delicious. Satay chicken was alright.  We had a choice between 3 entrees. I want to give them higher ratings for their service, but the spiciness between the dishes were very inconsistent. You get to choose on a 1-5 scale and finding a dish that suited your desired spiciness was a hit or miss. Some peoples 1-2 were super spicy and others 4-5 werent that spicy. (note: 5 is spiciest)  Also, we had a huge mess with the bill where they put all the appetizers onto one bill for a table, and none on ours. It was quite a mess trying to figure that out. Also, their timing for food was so bizarre. By the time 1 table had basically finished their dinner then the rest of the meals arrived.  Then again, dealing with 40+ people is a lot."
1,"I was really disappointed with my local Baja Fresh tonight.  The lobby, salsa bar and even drink station were very dirty and unkept.  To top that off my salad had old dark colored guacamole and limp lettuce. I hope they read this and will do a better job at cleaning up!"
5,We love Dr Steve!
2,Good service. The waitress was friendly. but the food was just icky and the Place smelled bad! like sewage pipes. I had a glass of wine. there was no way I was going to order a mixed drink while she was tearing the bar down.  I didnt feel good after eating the food. I had a coupon so it made the total bill cheap. But i would have walked out if I had to pay full price because The atmosphere they boast should provide better food. No Not good dont go
4,"Went to Sticklers for the first time today, with a friend who works across the street.  Im a little leary of places that get talked up so much, but Sticklers was everything she talked about and more.   A family friend once told me that the way to tell a good restaurant is how busy it is.  Seems like common sense now, but how many times have you walked into a restaurant with less than 10 people in the whole place and then walked away disappointed? Well Sticklers was packed.  My first impression was ""Crap, the line is 20 people deep and we only have 40 minutes for lunch...theres no way""!  Well I was pleasantly surprised when we got through the entire line, food in hand, in about 5!  The guys and gals that work there are efficient and have it down.  And they showed some great patience for a newbie. The chicken salad and provolone sandwich was outstanding and the hot peppers gave it a great kick.  Word of warning to the lactose intolerant - its a 2-piller!  The atmosphere was active and lively but not overly loud.  We were still able to have a conversation without shouting.  I just wished the people at the next table realized that.  We didnt need to hear about their daughter ""wrongly"" accused of DUI...for the third time!"
4,"This restaurant is truely cultural experience in your mouth---Chinese, Mexican with a dash of Jamaican. Pollo Diablo is fab! Mom and Pop place with some true TLC that goes into the food. The beer and wine was a good selection as well!  Way to Go!"
3,"This goodwill is Alright, I have been to better. Their selection is okay, cleanliness is okay and organization is okay. All goodwills prices are the same, as far as I know. The staff is helpful and I never have trouble finding somebody if I need help."
4,"I go frequently because every day, from 2-4pm, 44 oz. strawberry limeades are on ""happy hour"". But more importantly, chunks of more or less real strawberries come up the straw into your mouth. There are also real limes down in your gargantuan tankard of ice crunch and sweet sweet nectar. For a dollar.  Sometimes I get something big and fried at Sonic and it makes me feel a little gross, but on the whole their food is great if you can handle its intensity of flavor. I should note that I have a very fond memory of eating bacon cheeseburgers (and the aforementioned strawberry limeades) there after a hard days work, but that could have been the heat and poverty of the Tennessee county in which I was day laboring, or my avid youth, or the sheer novelty of my new southern surroundings. I do stick more to drinks and desserts if I go here though. Total Americana - theres a lot of junk to pick through, but you can make your personal choice for something special. I chose limeade."
5,"Five stars is truly deserved For Yasu. This is truly the best sushi in town and some of the best I ever had! I am a big seafood lover and there a lot of ""chain sushi"" places in Arizona that are decent and good for rolls, but if you want quality and authentic Japanese style fish and incredible Sashimi, you need to go to Yasu. There is really no way to describe it till you go, but once you do, you will become an instatnt fan!  Best thing to do is sit at the sushi bar and ask Yasu to make whatever he wants! You wont be disappointed.  The area and building are misleading... However, if you are the kind of person that thinks RA is the best thing since sliced bread and nothing can beat it, this is probably not for you. This is real sushi... Go try and enjoy!"
5,"Spotted Donkey Cantina is amazing!  They have delicious Mexican food, and fantastic margaritas to wash everything down with. You do have to pay for chips and salsa here, so there probably wont be any of that four bowl snacking before your main entrees come, but the medley of salsas it comes with make it all worth it. Ive tried quite a few of the dishes here, and theyve all been excellent.  In no particular order are my favorites: cheddar enchiladas with hatch chiles and rice...spicy! santa fe macaroni and cheese...again- spicy! cod and shrimp tostadas- delicious! shrimp fajitas shrimp tacos And for dessert: fried banana wraps or the mango margarita sundae!"""
5,"If you buy half a duck, you dont get to pick which duck. I lived in China, mainly Guangdong, for three years, and all it really took was a look at this sign, along of course with all the wonderful roasted ducks and pork, to know I had come across a place with bona fides.  Hope Kee has some of the very best Chinese food in town, in my opinion, and is worth the trip from wherever it is in the valley that you live.  I dont know anywhere else in town you can get such good congee, which is actually called ""zhou"" or ""jook,"" and which is a soupy, delicious rice porridge.   Theyre also one of the only places you can get dried scallop soup, which they do an excellent job of.  Dried scallops, a specialty of HK/Guangdong, are one of the most delicious things in the world.  Everything that they make is delicious, and sitting in there listening to the customers and staff talk in Chinese and Cantonese can really take you back to China, if youve had the pleasure of spending time there. Otherwise its just about as close as you can get.  If you want to eat some real Chinese food that is both delicious and approachable, and very reasonably priced, you cant beat Hope Kee.  Get some soup or some congee, some clams with black bean sauce, some greens and some BBQ, and youll see why China and Hope Kee are such hard places to stay away from.  If you do decide to try your hand at duck-picking and buy a whole duck, fear not for wasted leftovers, because roasted duck makes for a very tasty soup."
5,"This is the old location. For current reviews, look up Karens Kreamery Cafe. Here is what I posted for the new location...please give it a chance. I do not know the owners, I just love supporting a good, local business... Great ice cream, super cute store, extremely CLEAN! The ice cream is good, service is always great, and the location is fun (although a little out of the way). The prices are reasonable. I would rather support a locally owned business and pay more than McDonalds prices and less than Cold Stone prices. If you havent been, and plan on visiting in the Summer, bring suits for the kids. There is a nice little splash area right next to a big playground. Karens Kreamery is located in a big park/sports facility. There is also a medium sized skate park. We usually make a fun outing out it. My family loves this place!! Support local businesses!!!"
4,"Ahi tacos, rib tacos and ribs are all good but a little overpriced. Service staff is always top-notch. Both the beer and wine lists are good, mixed and specialty drinks are nicely done."
2,"When I heard about this place I was really excited because it is hard to find really friendly vegetarian food in Tempe.  The atmosphere here is great and very sunny.  It is in a strip mall which takes away from it a bit, but the inside has a funky feel to it.  I always want to like the food, but something is just off every time.  The black bean burger is good, but it comes on an untoasted piece of wheat bread that gets all soggy and falls apart.  Everything else is OK, but why do they do that.  It makes it disgusting.  Put it on a bun like normal people."
4,"Great food and very knowledgable/helpful staff. A little expensive, but the food is definitely worth it Have had pasta on one occasion and salmon on another....loved them both. Will definitely be back to support this great restaurant!"
4,"It was a busy bustling little town perched atop a small hill between the mighty Superstition Mountains to the east and the Goldfield Mountains to the west.    The first gold-strike was made in 1892, and it took just a little under a year before the town came to life. One rich strike after another supported the town and approximately 4000 people who lived in the district for five rich years.    The town boasted 3 saloons, a boarding house, general store, blacksmith shop, brewery, meat market and a school house. Just when it looked like the town would outgrow Mesa, the vein faulted, the grade of ore dropped and the town died a slow painful death. After several unsuccessful attempts to reopen the mines, the town did come to life again from 1910 on and off until 1926."
5,"I grew up at this library.  And now I am old and married and hope to someday take my very own kids to this library.  They have a great selection of audio books.  I am a major audio book fan and this is the place to be!  Clean, safe, you are not bothered by stranger dangers.  I dig this library."
2,"Okay now this is a large chain and on average its okay to good!  and I have been to this place many, many times, but I have to say the last time I went there for the happy hour hot wings (they were dry, over cooked) then I had ordered a steak and seafood combo (Cajun) something but after my second brew I thought it was me, so I had the wife and my son taste it man was it salty!!!!  It tasted like they dropped the salt shaker in the food, but my waitress assured me that could not have happened ""because all there sauces come in bags and are pre-made"" (Gross, that did it for me) I  was outta there with the quickness..."
3,"I am a sucker for a theme restaurant. I have been wanting to visit this place for a while because of their whole gimmick. When you arrive a nurse checks you in, gives you a hospital wrist band, and dresses you in a hospital gown. Seriously, I love a gimmick more than the next person but the Heart Attack Grill is 100% gimmick and only 60% good food. The menu consists of burgers which vary only in the number of patties, french fries fried in lard, shakes, pure sugar coke, and PBR. They have a strict no sharing policy which completely bummed us out because we wanted to order the huge 20 patty burger and split it 3 ways. We ordered 2 single bypass burgers (one of our trio boycotted the burger because of the no sharing policy,) all you can eat lard fries, a vanilla shake, full sugar coke and a PBR. The burgers were ordinary, the fries were ordinary, and the service (aside from being dressed as naughty nurses) was ordinary. The only win was the delicious butterfat filled vanilla shake.  The bill came to around $30, which is a bit pricey because remember only two of us actually had food. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it. It is a gimmick. Heart attack, fat, lard, waitresses dressed as nurses, cook dressed as doctors, sugar, beer...whatever. It gets old pretty fast."
5,Had a celebratory lunch for a colleague today. We had a group of ten. Service and ambiance were great. I had the best burger I can remember. It was Lons special burger; expensive at $16 but worth every penny.  Highly recommend.
2,"If youre into smoke that reeks all over...this is the casino for you.  It sure aint Vegas where you dont smell any smoke.  Peeee---uuuuu!  Stinky. And if that wasnt bad enough:  I went with a group of friends and we all ate at the buffet.  Now, in all honesty, some of the food there was pretty good:  the shrimp, the prime rib beef, the stuffed cheese lasagna, etc. Some was pretty bad like the ceviche  and the desserts--OMG--how bad they are.   My cheesecake was, obviously, a day or two old and had that refrigerator slightly hard crusting over it--plus, ever so slight smell from the fridge. Not yummy.  The pies were alot of filling and few pieces of fruit.  Just cheap desserts, so stick with the meat and fish. Here is the coup de gras, tho.  I was given a $4 comp on my players card.  I went to 3 different machines and they were all BROKEN!   Finally I find one that lit up green so I knew the players card was working. And guess what?  The $4 comp money never showed up on the card. If this Casino thinks I would actually spend money to sit in their stinking cigarette smoke loaded casino, they have another think coming.  Hell no! I also had a ticket to see their Showstoppers ""show"" which, if it sucked as much as their slots and crappy old desserts, I figured it wasnt worth it. On my way out to go home, I pitched both their non-working players card and their ticket to the ""show.""  I knew I would have more fun watching reruns of Sex and the City at home than boring myself even more. Goodbye, Casino Arizona.  You have alot of people in that casino so youre making money off some sucker...just not this sucker. Never again. (2 stars because their fish and meats were really good)"
4,"Well this is truly a hidden gem in Old Town Scottsdale. The wife and I visited this establishment last Sunday after church. There is usually a long wait here...but we arrived about 10 am and there was no wait. We were seated very quickly and the service was very good...there was a little wait for our food but no complaints about that though. I had 2 great buttermilk pancakes, turkey sausage, eggs, potatoes, and hash...the price....only 9 bucks plus tax...a really great deal. So if your ever in Old Town Scottsdale and need a great breakfast to get your day started...visit this establishment. Eat, Drink, and Be Merry my Friends!!!!!"
4,"This was a brand new experience for me, but so much fun!  The staff was very patient and helpful, and we felt perfectly safe after some one-on-training even though we were all newbies.  Only complaint is that the beginners walls were a little crowded, while there were a lot of super advanced walls not being used.  May want to swap the ratio to match the customer base.  But a very good time and an amazing workout.  It may be days before I can lift my arms again..."
5,"Heres the deal. I said I was done with OT, but a friend told me the management had changed and it was worth another shot.  My friend was right. Everything I had a problem with before was remedied. I went in unannounced, didnt tell anyone about a previous bad experience, and I was given some of the best service Ive received in town. When we went in, we were sat quickly and tended to very well for our entire visit. No texting employees, no indifferent waitstaff. The chef was in the food window expediting food, making sure it went out promptly and correctly. Not only was our server attentive, but there was a team service atmosphere and other servers came by our table when we had empty drinks, debris on the table, etc.  The decor has been refreshed, and although I didnt dislike the decor originally, it is definitely an upgrade as well. Now its much cleaner, but still maintains the character that was part of its charm before.  Props to the new management. Well done. Ill be back. PS - forgot to order side syrup. Curious to see if they still charge $2."
4,Went and got some delicious Boba today. Mango and Strawberry Banana.  Guy behind the counter is very welcoming and friendly. :) My choice place for quick to go Boba.
5,"a G Spot is a myth.  and Dr Graffenberg was a mad scientist. So its no surprise that I couldnt find the Gelato Spot either.  Shannon spouts, ""I love gelato so much, I would bathe in it"".  Hmmm, thats interesting I drove in and around the dirt road ... and went up and down Scottsdale  ... explored the box ... looked south of the landing strip at Scottsdale Airpark ... manually googled it ... orally asked the passerbys Road several times and I couldnt find it ANYWHERE Maybe I need to do more research.  Perhaps some field research...Or a targeted focus group *** UPDATE  *** Its on Shea Blvd??  No wonder I couldnt find it- I was looking down the wrong road *** UPDATE  *** Thanks Jake P for ""Yeah it is on Shea, in the strip mall area east of scottsdale rd near the Harkins Theater and Pita Jungle and such.... "" BUT the point of this review was sarcasm.  i.e. g- spot is hard to find *** UPDATE  *** Now I have a girl, ""Shannon W"", telling me where g-spot is.  She writes,  ""Its on 74th St. and Shea, in between Coffee Plantation and Pita Jungle."" Shannon W:  The point of this review was sarcasm.  i.e. g-spots are hard to find"
3,"You have to know what youre looking for to find this place.  Ive passed this location several dozen times and never realized that a restaurant & bar was located underground.  A friend of mine invited me to have a few drinks and some dinner and I was intrigued, so I decided to go for it. We sat at the bar and ordered glasses of Wine and some Oysters.  The bar was packed, but we were able to comfortably enjoy our food and have a conversation.  The food was OK.  The Wine was the house Zinfandel, which was *eh*....but I didnt like the call options, so whatever.....now I know not to order Wine here. Overall, it wasnt too bad of an experience.  Next time, Ill go with a Beer instead of Wine and try sitting in the dining room. Return Factor - 80%"
4,"Ive been here three times once for lunch and twice for dinner. Lunch was pretty crowded, dinner not so much but tons of take out. Prices are cheap and food is good!  I love the beans and I recently tried the guacamole and loved it. Try it out and see for yourself."
5,"I put forth that we need to institute a new standard of measurement to be used for comparing coffee shops.  Furthermore, I think that Cartel Coffee Labs should use this place as a standard for this new unit of measurement. I have to assume its called a ""Coffee Lab"" for a reason.  Too many coffee shops these days are retail stores, where coffee is an incidental thing in all the yelling, stupid names, and fancy colors.  If you look at the menu of Cartel Coffee Lab, there are a total of 13 items.  Its all about the coffee, plain and simple. Then again, theres really nothing simple about it to those who take their coffee as seriously as this place does.  The artistry of their baristas is not to be trifled with.  These people can make a latte so pretty, you really wont want to drink it (until you do, then youre happy you did).  On top of that, the selection of coffee varietals is impressive.  Ive only tried one, but that alone was better than anything Starbucks tries to pawn off on the masses.  Perhaps the use of the term ""Lab"" is because theyve actually stepped beyond anything any other coffee shop has done.  Either way, the formula that they came up with works better than anything Ive come across before. Then again, maybe Im being too hard on the other places.  Its not that they have an intrinsically inferior product, but the reason for these places has been lost behind t shirts and mugs and open mic nights and selling you a card containing the same money youd use on the place anyway... I digress.  Cartel Coffee Labs is a great place with a fantastic product.  If their WiFi is weak or the back corner gets dark, I honestly dont care.  Their coffee is excellent and Ill be coming back for more."
4,"Had myself a new york striploin and it was quite good although I do hate paying these kind of prices for steak.  I really thought the vegetables were more special than the steak, but if you compare what kind of quality steak you get here compared to say Donovans (high quality steakhouse in CA), Ive got to say that I like the overall package presented at Keg Steakhouse with respect to the quality and price."
3,"I moved in here a few ago and I do like it for the most part. The grounds are kept clean and tidy, except for some irresponsible pet owners. Some of them even let their pets run around leash-less or cannot control them. But that is not the managements issue. Pros: 1. The apts are spacious, well-built. 2. Grounds are clean and grass is maintained. 3. Pool is well-maintained. 4. Online system for rent pay and maintenance tickets is great. 5. Price is great for the value. Cons: 1. Apts not sound-proof or heat-proof. 2. Sprinklers tend to sprinkle more water over the sidewalks than the grass area. 3. Covered parking is extra $$$ and not enough of them anyways. 4. Uncovered spots are all just crowded in the parking lot at the back. 5. Security gates are open most of the time from the front and have gaps that could let an adult through on the sides. 6. Outer compound Walls are not high enough to actually prevent/make it difficult for an intruder. 7. Fitness center is adequate at best. Most of the free weights and equipment (except the machines) are broken or missing. The machines work ok, but are not maintained well. 8. Leasing office employees could use a bit more smile and inter-personal skills."
4,"Why pay full price for mens clothing when you can find quality used items here? Well Suited consistently has an excellent selection of suits, sportcoats, slacks, dress shirts and golf shirts. You can also trade in your old clothing for store credit or cash. The credit is good at any of the different stores in the My Sisters Closet chain, including all of their stores that carry mens and womens clothes, furniture and kids apparel, furniture and toys."
3,Pretty tasty dogs.  Pretty long wait for a hot dog.
4,Sometimes you just gotta have a burger.  I was in the Scottsdale Rd/Grayhawk area and noticed this place where Nicks used to be.  I tasted their burger at the Scottsdale Culinary Festivals Burger Battle and thought it was really good. The CB&CB burger with tater tots really hit the spot for lunch.  The burger and carmelized onions worked together really well.  The tater tots were delicious. Overall it was a satisfying meal and Ill be back soon.
4,"I think half the fun of a used bookstore is the treasure hunt.  This used bookstore is better organized than some of my old haunts in Dallas but I will survive. I think of used bookstores similar to looking through your Grandmothers attic at her book collection - it isnt supposed to be all shiny and new. Bookmans has a decent selection of books, Ive found an entire collection of Rishdie one afternoon! Of course it is always going to be a crapshoot but that is just the way it is in used books."
3,"My husband and I tried this place out since it is fairly close to our house and gets decent reviews.  I drank, my husband ate.  The wine selection is ok and the staff seemed friendly.  My husbands dinner was okay.  Id probably give this place better reviews had they not attempted to give themselves a $15 bump on their tip.  Id also probably give them better reviews if the manager would have called me back after leaving a message with a staff member about the charge especially when I left all the details necessary to fix the issue and was promised a call back that afternoon when the manager arrived.  Now, I can only assume it was not an inadvertent mistake since they give me no reason to believe otherwise.  I really would rather not have to keep calling back and chase my $$ down. Edited review - took them from 1 star to 3 stars since I received a phone call today from a manager and was advised it was a mistake and they credited me back the funds.  Also will be sending me a gift card for the trouble.  Overall, I appreciate the follow up and their efforts to fix the issue and bring me back in.  I was routing for them since the patio seems like a pretty chill place to have some drinks and unwind."
2,"This place is great - IF YOU LIKE TO BE IN A SNOBBY ENVIRONMENT!  There are not too many places that Ive been to that are more hype than anything.  But this is one of them.  When you try to go to THE PINK TACO, its impossible to find a parking space.  Once you make your way to the front, the hostess is always too busy texting her friends than interested in helping the customer!!  If you are lucky enough to find a seat at the bar, you better have a rolex watch on or you will not be served quickly.  Either that, or you better be a Hugh Heffner spouse.  I tried the burrito and was grossed out by how rubbery it was."
4,"My husband and one year old son dined here on a Saturday night. Service was great, food was delicious, and the BYOB was much appreciated! Staff was very accomodating with our baby. :)"
1,My brother also posted about our Mothers Day experience. These must be franchises because the Scottsdale and Chandler locations are like eating at a different restaurant entirely. This is the second and last time we will frequent this location. The pizza and calzones were awful.
5,"I was truly impressed by the quality of service and the knowledge of the employees. I have had my ears pierced at Claires when I was 4 (way to go, Dad!) and an industrial piercing performed at Club Tattoo. I went in to adjust my bar bell for my industrial piercing and they explained a lot of things I had no clue about, like the difference in threading. The place is clean and every one is friendly. I will ONLY ever go to HTC when I need to handle my current piercings or want to get another. Thank you!"
5,"Beer is awesome (first timers must do the beer flight sampler) and I have never had a meal that wasnt excellent!   A quick note, there isnt a/c in the building so keep that in mind during the summer months - although that doesnt stop anyone from going, the place is always jumping!"
4,"The workers here are SO friendly. The minute you walk in the door youll here a ""Hello, welcome to paradise!""  and if you stay to eat/study/chat youll probably hear it every few seconds. I love coming here to study. They have lots of chairs and booths that welcome it and the staff, of course, does not care how long you sit.  Food is decent. There are better bakeries in general but I can say that their cookies and salads are worth trying."
4,Breakfast is fantastic.  Work on the coffee selection.  Only thing holding back a star is no French press coffee or an espresso machine
2,I dont know how this place stays in business. The menu is so limited. Would you like chicken or chicken? Chicken in a pita? Chicken on some lettuce? Chicken rolled in a tortilla? And the pita chips are bland! Yuck! And  the potato salad has something in it that is way too tangy. Ive only been twice and tried different dishes both times but I just dont get anything greek about this place.
2,"So I have been to the location in Tucson and now experienced this one and I have to say that I did not have a WOW or YUMMM drooling moment at either. Dont get me wrong its not horrible it just has no wow factor at all to me and I will pass next time. There is just better Mexican cuisine out there,,, Service was promt though!"
4,"We had my husbands birthday party here.  The staff could not have been more accommodating.  They made everything easy! Our friends loved the place and the band (ReGroove) and had a wonderful time.  Drinks are well-priced and very generous.  The owners and staff truly want customers to be happy, comfortable, stress-free and to have a good time!!"
5,"Heres how to do Pizzeria Bianco the right way: 1. Show up at 3:30 or earlier to get a good place in line. Make sure you bring some friends to enjoy the time together and the great food. 2. At 4:00, the bar opens. Get yourself a bottle of wine and make the best of the 90 minutes youll spend just waiting to get on the seating list. 3. Order a few appetizers from the bar; theyre light and fresh and yummy. 4. When you finally get seated for dinner, dont hold back. Order salads, share different pizzas, and have a coffee after. The quality of the food is ABSOLUTELY worth the wait. We tried eating here a few times over the past couple of years, but realized it takes commitment and two bottles of wine to make it through the line. Best pizza Ive had since Italy. Bravo Bianco!"
1,"I was looking into gyms around the area. Upon entering I was greeted by the front desk guy. I asked about memberships and then he said, ""Sorry we are sold out"". I stood there stunned. Then he snickered, ""Just kidding"". Trying to be a good sport I went with it.  Next came the young sales guy. He was personable - at first anyways. Showed me around the gym and I was interested in joining. Next we went over to the childcare area since I have a little one. Children were in the room however the two girls monitoring the room were chatting it up with one another and ignoring the kids. Bad sign. I asked the girls if they were CPR certified and had fingerprinting and background checks. The world stopped for just a moment and they stared at me. I had interrupted their important conversation. Then they were both saying, ""Yeah, like, well, um, no, I mean yes,"". In other words, no straight answers.  We sat at the sales guys desk and the wheeling and dealing began. I felt like I was purchasing a new car. ""If you choose option A, you then can go to all the gyms."" ""If you choose option B, then only here"" . The whole time I could see the childrens area and the kids were being completely ignored (and we are talking very little children). When I told the sales man I needed to think about it he switched into some type of Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde routine. ""Well you only have today to make a decision, after that no price guarantee!!!""   From there he was down right rude. I walked out of there thinking what the heck just happened. Like Sarah G, I felt horrible when I left this gym.  It was an awful experience. Ended up getting a membership at Tangible Fitness on 7th Street. They dont have the same amenities however it is locally owned, and the people are very nice there."
1,veerrrrrryyyyyyyyy dirty. I think I will buy them some clorox wipes and light bulbs for their sign out front. I made 12 u-turns trying to find this place.
1,"Lets talk about failure, baby. Hey, if your idea of salad is punishment via tasteless lettuce and mealy tomatoes splashed with the most generic, industrial vinaigrette, youve found just the right place to BDSM your tongue. Go for it! I ordered Capellini Checca, and I had it substituted with Spaghetti (I like more girth re: pasta).  What I got was the limpest pile of spaghetti that couldnt be revived with a lifetime supply of Viagra.  The DOA pasta was topped with a pathetic sprinkling of more mealy tomatoes (the menu says Fresh Roma Tomatoes- these had the texture and taste of a dying horses ass moreso than fresh produce).  The faint, acrid garlic tasted like it came out of a shaker bottle and not a bulb- and motherf*&k, respectable Checca should have more than 1/16 teaspoon of microscopically chopped basil.   This place makes Old Spaghetti Factory look like fine dining, and I would rather starve than be even close to that chain restaurant of culinary doom.  Hell, this place is the  disowned, cracked-out junkie brother of OSF. Its really *that* terrible. I gave them the single star only because the management was incredibly lovely, and did not charge for the unforgivable disaster masquerading as edible food worth paying for."
4,"I have been dying to go here since a coworkers spouse is one of the chefs. We finally went  last night  before the Symphony and it was a very good dining experience. The food came impossibly fast. The shrimp and Sausage Po Boy sliders were heavenly. The bread is this roll type of joy like break back east. Yum. You know the type of bread you cant find in AZ or west of the Rockies as Al Pacino would say-lol!They also served the bread basket with a veggie type of garnish if mixed with butter and put on the bread it had a very pleasing taste to it. Innovative menu- Lobster Potpie and Duck Quesadillas. HMMMMMM! Interesting. I had a side of Mac and cheese which is what I had heard about for so long and a Caprese Salad. My friend had divine Salmon. I am not a Salmon fan but i tasted it and it was yummers. My Ice tea was tasty and my friend had  a Basil Mojito that was mixed well. I dont like them usually because they are so strong mouthwashy tasting, but this had a nice blend to it. The restaurant decor is beautiful.We did not get desert but I want to go back and try those Seasalt sticks. All in all I loved going here. DT was packed last night due to Wrestle-Mania but we were in and out  in an hour at 5ish, so try that time to avoid crowds. Service was great despite other reviews. I know great service and I had it."
3,"So Im not a big Chinese food fan, but my husband is. Truth be told, it usually makes me sick. But if I were to go to Chinese food, Dragon Palace would be one of the places that I would go. The food is decent and theres a lot of it. I really felt I was getting my values worth. The waitstaff was attentive (always there asking if I wanted a refill) and the food came out quickly. It looks like every other Chinese food restaurant in the world (lots of red and gold, lanterns, paper Chinese Horoscope place mat -- save for the deep teal walls).  Im not sure I would make a long drive to Dragon Palace because chances are you have a comparable Chinese food restaurant nearby, but if you live in the 32nd St. and T-Bird vicinity, this is certainly a Chinese food place worth trying.  As for the food, we ordered the Peking dinner for 2 which came with won ton soup, a pu pu platter (consisting of won tons - yum -, eggroll, a small fried shrimp, a skewer of glazed beef and honey chicken), Peking fried rice (fried rice with shrimp, chicken, pork and beef), Mongolian beef and the house chicken. (as an aside and a disclaimer, I am preggers right now and I have developed a severe dislike for chicken which means I, of course, hated the chicken dishes). My husband thought it all was ok. I really liked the won ton soup and the Peking fried rice. After dinner, we got the requisite fortune cookie (""Express yourself now."" WHAT?) and a really yummy banana wrapped in a won ton and fried with a sugar glaze thing. All in all, it was a good time at a pretty good Chinese Food Restaurant."
5,Best chocolate croissants EVER!!!!
2,Ive fequented here often enough to know that all the majority of the games here are all those ticket games and little claw type games. I come to hang out with friends and play some games. I can in on tuesday night around 6pm and thought to have dinner there since I had a coupon for the place. I really didnt care about price at the time with the coupon.  After being seated our waitress got our drinks took our order and everything was fine. After we recieved the food we were left unattended for quite some time. When the waitress finally returned I had to ask for a refill and some ketchup as well. My drink was empty so I would assume that would be something that the waitress would ask but I caught her before she left. My boyfriend did not recieve a single refill the entire night and we were there from 6pm to 9pm. We had friends meet us there and we just chatted it up for some time. It wasnt for some time that we realised that the place was bare not just of customers but of staff as well. It was as if they closed the place down and just left us. After the waitress had taken our check and cashed us out that was the last we saw of her. The plates of our food were still in front us the entire time and we had kind of placed them all together so that she could come and just take them...kind of thought that the bunch of plates stacked together would give the hint we were done but I guess I shouldnt be so subtle next time.  The food was ok at best. Nothing bad nothing good in hind sight though if I had to pay full price for what I got if that waitress had left us like she did and I didnt frequent the games I wouldve walked out. Probably wouldnt notice.  All in all go for the games if anything else. The games are even ok that is IF they are running. Sometimes I come in and games are off or not working. This is just a place that is convienent for myself and friends to meet up.
3,"The meat shop has 100% grass fed beef, which means that they also finish their beef with grass (alfafa) which cant be said for every place that claims to have grass fed beef.  This is great if you are trying to eat food the way its supposed to be, none of that factory farming... However the same cant be said for the pork.  The pork (or at least the bacon) contains nitrates which keeps me from eating it.  The farm that provides the pork also feeds the pigs grain. This place would be perfect if they were able to get pigs and chickens that are pastured centered and not fed grain as part of their diets.  Until then Ill stick to their great prices on the grass fed beef and obtain my chickens and pork from somewhere else."
1,I work right across the street and a few of us went here for lunch one afternoon. I ordered a salad to go. As soon as I saw the guy grab shredded sandwich lettuce to make my salad I almost told him to stop but I didnt. I regreted it when I started to dig in and realized the lettuce was brown and yellow. Very disappointed. $6+ bucks for nasty lettuce tomatoes and green peppers. I ordered a salad thinking I was getting something like the picture on their website. I wont be returning here. Ill be passing on lunch next time the co-workers opt for this place.
3,"It is a total dive bar...If you need a drink go get one.  There are pool tables, shuffle board, video game or two, and a jukebox.  The bartenders know their stuff.  Enough said!"
5,"Brown bag chicken sammich, mac n cheese, fried okra, and the bourbon drink.  Nuff said."
4,Their Bruschetta selection was absolutely amazing.
5,"I love that this Safeway is right across the street from my work. I like to walk here for a bit of exercise to get lunch. The deli is awesome. They have a sandwich bar that has these really great gourmet ingredients they will make a sandwich for you. For 5.49 its not too bad and if you use your Safeway card you buy 7 get the 8th sandwich free. They also have premade salads and a hot bar as well. Very friendly, Alan who has made my sandwiches the last couple weeks is very friendly and does a good job. Bonus points the Starbucks is right next to it!"
2,"The place has a nice little vibe going on and they have some unique items but the reason the rating is so low is that there really arent a lot of options that dont involve faux meat.  Arent these people vegan?  Dont they hate the idea of poor little animals being our food (even though that is the only reason they are alive)?  Then why so much FAKE MEAT?!   I will never understand the meat envy vegans and vegetarians have.  I go to a place like this to get a dish that uses vegetables in more creative ways, not to get some overly processed soy products that arent nearly as healthy as fresh lean meats like chicken and fish.  FYI, I love meat but every once in a while I like to grab a vegetarian dish.   Another negative is nearly everything is fried.  Guess they bust the myth that people are vegan because it is healthier.  Frying things is the cheap way out of actually creating a healthy AND tasty meal.   Ill give them a 2.5 star because what we chose was quite tasty.  But with nearly every option involving faux meat and tofu it really is a disappointment.  If you want legitimate vegan fare try out some indian places or Ethiopian places.  They are very creative and using spices to flavor a vegetable dish. The fake cheeses and meats are for Vegans with meat envy, not for Omnivores that just want a good meal.  Keep your expectations in check and you should be okay."
5,"We went here for my wifes birthday, and its a rare 5-star review for me. They scored on food, presentation, service and atmosphere. We sat indoors - its a bit hot out still - and loved the decor, including the fun pillows on our large booth seat. Service was prompt, friendly, and attentive - but we never felt rushed. They make a killer mango mojito that perfectly balances the mango, lime and rum flavors. The kurobuta pork was perfectly prepared. And after having some disappointing lobster (in Maine of all places) the Maine lobster here was done just right - firm but not tough. They serve it ""lazy style"" and did a great job with both claw and tail meat coming out perfectly. A special birthday souffle topped the evening off. Expensive but absolutely worth it for a special occasion."
4,"Tasty Kabob is kind of a throw away name, but the service and food are excellent. The hummus is good, not the best I have ever had, but it is better than many places I have been to. The chicken kabob was excellent, I am not sure how they spice the chicken shwarma, but it is excellent. I had the gyro platter and that was also excellent.  What I really do not understand is why Pita Jungle is so packed and this place is empty. The food is more authentic and frankly tastes better in my opinion. No more Pita Jungle for me. When I am in the area, I will go to Tasty Kabob."
1,"I decided to try qwest as I was tired of Cox continually raising their rates. BAD CALL! Cox may cost a little more but is completely worth it. If I wasnt locked in to a BS contract I would switch back right now. Internet: I signed up for their ""Heavy Duty"" internet @ 20 Mbps. I regularly test less than 2Mbps on dslreports.com. The best I have ever seen is a little over 5. When I call to try and get it fixed they tell me there is no guarantee on speeds. That is why they advertise ""up to"" 20 Mbps... Phone: Extremely poor sound quality, very loud static and crackling, shocking as this is what they should be good at. I called to complain they explained we would have to pay to have technician look at it. This was the day after install!! Helpful hint, call back and tell them you want to cancel your account. The customer loyalty group is actually decent, they sent out a tech free of charge. He fixed it after a couple of hours, but acted completely put out that we wanted a clear line... The bundle: Ah my favorite part and what has finally pushed me over the edge to submit a review...  I went with a bundled package (phone, cable, internet). The plan I signed up for was $147 a month. The first bill was $147, the second bill in Im at $272.43. I cant make any sense out of the bill so Im not sure why they think i owe this much. I love the fact that I will get the pleasure of wasting another hour plus of my day tomorrow talking to these fools.  The day this contract is up Im going back to Cox and Ill be happy to pay more!!"
4,What can I say - I love this place!  I was introduced to it by a group of 20 something friends so I was a bit worried going there (Im no longer of that age group.)  Turns out I had nothing to fear!  Roosevelt is perfect for a glass of wine with the hubby or post dinner cocktails with a group of friends.  Still have a the munchies after dinner - there is a great food menu selection as well.
4,Love Sweet Tomatoes!  My favorite is their Won Ton Chicken Happiness salad!  Although it can be expensive it is a great alternative for fast food!
1,"I give this location no love.  We went to this one rather than the one uptown on a Saturday night with a voucher from another location from a bad sushi upchuck experience.  Going late at night with a mostly empty restaurant, we still ended up waiting 10 minutes to be sat, then SHOVED and I mean shoved in next to the only other table in the place - the hostess snickered at me when I kindly asked to move a single table down (really sick of bitchy hostesses in Scottsdale by the way - your job is not that hard so shut up and color for christs sake)  Our waitress took another 10 minutes just to greet us, sushi took forever, and if you can believe it the fun hadnt even begun yet.   When paying the bill, we present the voucher to the waitress, who says she cant take it.  The manager came over with a bitchy look, basically trying to call it bull shyt and continued to give us the 5th degree about it for the next few minutes - certainly NOT appreciated.  She takes it to the point where she calls the other location where we got it (taking ANOTHER 10 minutes) and finally gives us our bill back - only taking off our 2 rolls and 2 nigiri.  This created one pissed off yelper instantaneously. Dont bother with this location - you could find bomb shrapnel in your soup and they still wouldnt give a damn.   And for the sake of all that is holy - STOP WITH THE CRAZY IM-TOO-SEXY-FOR-MYSELF SCENE!  YOURE NOT THAT COOL!"
5,We went today after lunch. I got my usual of lime basil and real mint chip (which I love for the real mint leaves) and my hubby got chocolate guiness and four peaks hop knot. Best ice cream in Phoenix! The staff is always super nice. They give us ice bags to take our ice cream home :-)  Love this place
4,"I have never eaten a regular meal here. I usually go for the reverse happy hour from 10-12pm. Cheap drinks, good food and a good atmosphere. The servers here are good. I dont eat sushi myself, but everyone I go with loves the Crunchy Crab Rolls.  They have three different pizzas, pepperoni, BBQ chicken and cheese. I have had the pepperoni and BBQ chicken. Both were extremely good. I definitely recommend that someone looking for a good time, cheap drinks, and good food."
5,"I come here probably at least once a week. The prices are right, theres a good variety of ""ethnic"" food, the cashiers are quick and friendly, and theyre just helpful. I locked myself out of my car when having a space-cadet moment and they let me use their phone to call AAA to bail me out.  Fresh flowers + great selection of wine and cheese + all the essentials  They deal is that they cut out the middle man to get great prices for quality products and they dont have sales because they always sell their products at the best price possible. =) GO TJS!"
4,"Just spent two years in Austin eating BBQ from all over the state. This place is legit.....for Phoenix. WORLD CLASS sausage and excellent brisket!   Sides were average.  Nothing much exciting there. The bread was killing both me and the quality of the meat. The sauce is too sweet.  It would be great for St. Louis style ribs, but this is Texas...put some spice in there."
4,Great fried fish and crispy onion rings....yum!
4,"Awesome pizza, great cocktails, and salads. Friendly staff. A favorite!"
1,"Be VERY, VERY careful asking for a sandwich as a wrap. I ordered a ham and cheese make your own sandwich, ordered it as a wrap to go. I got home, theres lettuce and mayo and... what this? whats this I see in this sandwich? theres the cut-off fingertip of someones glove lodged between the lettuce? (At least I hope its the finger tip of a glove - Im not even going to think of the other thing it could have been.) Ewwww.... gross.... I didnt finish the sandwich. Memo to self: Dont ever get wraps from Einsteins, particularly not the one on Shea. Disgusting. If it ever happens again, Im calling a local news station to report it, then Ill call the state health department. Gross, gross, gross, gross, gross, gross... if you cant deliver sanitary wraps, THEN DONT PUT THEM ON THE MENU. Not a place to go if you like wraps."
3,"This place confounds me... They have an excellent beer and wine selection. As a matter of fact, their beer selection is one of the best Ive seen in AZ. Tons of micro-beers and many different and unique bottles of rare Euro- brau. For the selection, to stop by and pick something up and go, this place is great. As a restaurant/Wine Bar bar, I give this place a big...Meh. The service was terrible. Of the party of 6, everyone that ordered a glass of wine, only got one. They sat with their glasses empty for at least 30 minutes. Those of us drinking beer, just walked over to cooler and grabbed a beer. We also had an appetizer. We got the warm pretzels with gourmet mustard. It was frozen pretzels they microwaved with Honey mustard. They were still cool in the middle and a little stale.  Maybe it was just an off night or something, Ill probably give it another shot."
5,"Never thought Id review a supermarket, but since its tough times for alot of people out there, Id like to share my 2 cents.. First of all, you dont need a card.  The deals are for everyone and it makes it hassle-free during checkout.  Now, about the deals ~ I find that Albertsons has the lowest prices and best deals and you can find them amonst any product youre looking for.  Its WAY cheaper than Safeway for sure. This is what i found yesterday:  88 cents for 2 (yes two!) snicker bars or other comparable chocolate bars, $1 for a bag of lifesavor hard candies, and $14.99 for a 24 bottle case of coors light.  They also had 69 cent bags of frozen veggies that people were buying like crazy.  Also, this location has really good cuts of meat.  Im Korean and was so excited that they had short ribs cut perfectly for Kalbi jjim (korean braised shortribs), and for $3.99 a pound, it was quite a deal!"
5,"I just love Chipotle. Fresh, yummy, spicy (if you want it to be). And the restaurant was clean a HUGE plus! My personal fav is the chicken burrito, no rice, no beans w/ fajita veggies, pico, cheese, sour cream, and lettuce. Guacamole and hot sauce on the side. So delicious!!! The person who did our order was so nice! It was my friends first Chipotle experience! She was impressed by how big the burrito was. Im glad I only live a few blocks away... because I will be back."
4,"I didnt stay here, but patronized their restaurant. The servers were very polite and accommodating. They frequently refilled our drinks and aimed to serve by making sure the fireplaces were working. Its a nice place to hang at if you have a reason to be here."
5,"This wasnt the first time, but we went to Tutti Santi for a family Christmas Eve Dinner.  All I have to say is that everything was simply perfect.  Not only the food, but the service.  Which to me makes a restaurant with great food go from good to great.   I ate the lamb shank- Angello Dorato, which fell off the bone and was delicious. I cleaned the plate.  Dad had the veal marsala with fettuccine alfredo.  The veal was fantastic and the alfredo was just right. The sauce was not too thick-not to thin.  Dad cleaned the plate.  From him being in the food industry for 30+years and eating in many italian establishments both here and Chicago, believe me that says more than alot.    Mom had the special of the night, which was a cioppino with tons of seafood.  When most italian restaurants serve this dish at least one of the seafood items will be rubbery or fishy tasting (not in a good way) especially the mussels.  Not here. Everything was the way it should be. I felt this was the plate of the evening out of 3 great dishes.   Mom didnt clean the plate, she has a small stomach.  But I will be eating the leftovers in about two hours after I sleep off my meal. Everything from the bread, the calamari fritti, to the tiramisu was fabulous.  Im glad we couldnt get reservations anywhere else for this special meal.    Gratzi and Buon Natale. Oh yeah, I didnt get the raviolis this time, but if youve havent had them its a must try."
4,"Hey, art is very personal so I wont pretend to be objective about jordre studio.  What I can tell you is that anyone who has the cajones to open their own studio and, more importantly, the staying power to be an ongoing entity is deserving of praise.  I have a friend who owns several of Kyles pieces and they look spectacular. If, like me, you look for a personal connection with your art, youll be hard pressed to do better than JS.  Kyle is outgoing and personal and, if youre especially nice, hell share a Schwanns ice cream sandwich with you.  How about that for an artistic connection?!"
3,"I like to call this ""My Bashas"".    On the positive side, the selection of wine and beers is pretty extensive, the produce is fresh with quite a few organic choices.  The natural foods section has a number of pleasant surprises and theyve added some new bulk dispensers there as well.  Ive had mixed experiences getting help in the meat section but the checkout up front is always quick, much faster than some of the other grocery store chains out there."
4,"Went to the Rooste for a Christmas Eve dinner among a small group (9) friends. I had never been. Had heard the name many times over the years when I had previously lived in Tempe.  Been intimidated that by where it set that it was expensive and swanky. Thats all a lie! It sets up high and has a wonderful view. Its not located where you are just strolling down the street and decided to pop in that is true. You wind through these grounds to the back of the property pass beautiful fountains and buildings until you come to the lite up restaurant. You can self park but why bother go for the valet.  You pass a smelly ranch steer at the entry that is probably wondering why the hell its there as much as I was. Inside the door the smell escapes you immediately, thank goodness. You see some young sap making cotton candy and wonder what the heck have I arrived at. A few more steps and you see you are in a western theme establishment, by the overwhelming amount of raw wood beams and flooring.  First stop the bar. Its a limited full bar and for this it losses a star.  From the bar the view outside is great and you can look down and see the country music band playing (it was a band but I wouldnt book em) but hey they gave the place a little extra pulse. You see the staff in casual western gear also and you instantly know youre welcome in your jeans.  Moments later our table was ready and half of us choose to take the slide down to the dining floor and the others took the steps. Hey I went for the slide! It was short and fast and another reason to come casually dressed.  Our waitperson was a delightful and articulate young woman. We skipped the appetizers to leave room for dessert (next time Ill reverse that decision). The menu was very good. Several steak cuts, enchiladas, fried chicken, BBQ beef & pork ribs, Seafood, a burger, pork chops, most plates $15 - $20.  While waiting for the salad course a magician name Flash comes up and asks if wed like some magic that night (he works for tips). He went about his tricks and blew our minds! THIS GUY I WOULD HIGHER for an event. Never figured out how he did what he did but would love to see him doing it again and again. So if he comes by your table take him up on his offer of magic.  The food arrives, the salad is good and fresh the main courses come and all are cooked to perfection. My medium rare T-Bone was actually medium rare for once! My steak was tender and taste fabulous. The food didnt hold its heat well and they serve sweet potatoes or rice with the dishes rather than standard baked/mashed or fried Idahos (extra charge for a standard potato - why? - Minus another 1/2 star). But over all it was a good meal. We barely had room for the dessert so we split a 9 layer chocolate fudge cake and another dessert among us. And we still had four or so layers of cake left to go home! It was so rich and such a huge slice no 3 people could have eaten the entire thing following a meal if they tried... 4 of us dug into this slice.  All in all it its a great steakhouse. Prices lower than Lonestar and Steak portions (ounces) bigger for your money, plus a better all over food and appetizer menu by far. Oh yeah Im a fan and will be returning again and again when I want a steakhouse to fill my steak cravings and a bit of entertaining to accompany the meal.  I highly recommend Rustlers Rooste."
5,Nobody likes going to the auto body shop..period!  These guys took a negative situation and absolutely turned it around. They immediately made me feel at home from the moment I approached the front desk; all the way up to the ownership of the shop. It was a professional experience with a family friendly approach. The work they completed on the rear bumper of my car was excellent. I HIGHLY recommend Impact AB for your AB repair needs. Tom Butka was a pleasure to work with. Thanks Impact AB for everything!
4,"This is my favorite Tapas joint in town. Its a place I have to get the same thing everytime and maybe more to try a few new items... my must haves are: Island Gingered Yam & Pumpkin Bisque Soup (Seasonal)... so good and the fact that its seasonal makes it even more of a special treat. Camarones Al Ajillo (Garlic Shrimp)... this is my all time favoreite dish thus far @ Havana... I can eat it as my meal as long as they provide me as much of their tasty bread as I need to sop the dish dry of all the yummy garlic sauce it contains. Maduras Fritos... Fried plantains... need I say more? Mojito... best in town in terms of authenticity. Marquesas de Chocolate aka Chocolate Pate... I never cared for dessert here until I tasted this strangely named treat. It is so rich at first you think it will be too little but then you realize you need to share with everyone at your table. Other worthy options:  Arroz Con Pollo... It has baby peas in it and I really dont like peas... but I like them in this dish! I got to try this dish because a friend ordered it as his meal and didnt even make a dent in it... so I got all the leftovers and it was pretty tasty and economical! Fritoras de Frijoles Negros... Ive never had Black Bean Fritters before--they are quite tasty dipped in Guacamole! Calypso Chips...A thinner more chippy version of Fried Plantains. Sun Spots... Sweet Potato Fritters pretty tasty as well... for a fried root vegetable! Datiles Con Chorizo... A meatier appetizer... not the best Ive had but pretty darn good. Empanaditas... These are alright... though Im partial to Filipino style Empanadas... but since I have no place to buy them from, nor have I mastered making them, these are quite good for a band-aid craving. Tamal Cubano... pretty tasty, but my fave is the soupier Salvadorean take on the chicken tamale. Flan... havent had it, but flan consistency throughout varying cultures seems pretty consistent. Free Goodness: Their Bread! Its just the way I like it, hot, thin and crisp crust and soft in the middle! As you can see, outside of the Arroz Con Pollo, I have not tried many of their entrees... Im quite content to dine with others and share Havanas wonderful tapas... but one day I WILL try their Paella. A vegetarian friend said they make a veggie paella that was pretty tasty... and she loves their Mojitos just as much as I do so I think she may be right on this one. Cant wait to try it... with a side of Camarones al Ajillo and a Mojito!"
3,"Unlike a lot of the other reviewers, I actually had a decent experience here. We came in yesterday (Sunday) around 2. The place was pretty quiet, excluding the plethora of football fans who came here to watch their games. They have a ton of TVs to do so, including a HUGE screen that was playing the Cardinals game. No complaints about that. Some of the guys were rowdy but hey so am I when I watch football. It took us a while to be seated. Im not quite sure where the hostess was. As soon as we were seated we were helped by a very pretty and sweet girl. Our food took a while even though the place was pretty dead, but what we got was satisfying. We started with the nachos which were really good and then I got their jalapeno burger and my friend got their pork sandwich sliders. The fries were seasoned well and crispy. The service needs some work: nonexistent hostesses, disappearing servers, slow cooks, but this place could be a real gem."
5,"Grassroots is right around the corner and we drive by it every week on our usual Friday-Dinner-Out.  I always assumed it was more of a pub than a restaurant.  My wife and I arrived around 5:00pm and were seated immediately.  The waiter was super attentive and knew the menu and preparation of everything I asked about.   We started with an AMAZING appetizer special of burrata* with ciabatta tips, their house spicy tomato jam and arugula with champagne vinaigrette.  It was described as a sort of an experimental combination of preparations from other dishes.  The burrata was silky smooth and spreads onto the ciabatta like softened cream cheese.  The play of flavors in this dish was excellent, wed go back here just for this dish alone. My wife ordered the lobster bisque as her entree, which was smooth and creamy with a good lobster flavor.  I suspect we could have asked for bread on the side, but it didnt come with it by default. I ordered the short ribs with roasted asparagus and jalapeno cheddar grits.  The ribs were cooked just right, just a little pink and tender with a concentrated glaze of delicious sauce layered on top.  The sauce had a light smoky flavor with a fair amount of saltiness, and appeared to be a long simmered reduction with bold flavor. As others have mentioned, the jalapeno grits are very good, not spicy by any means but a little crunch from the jalapeno pieces, creamy and well prepared.  I strongly recommend the short ribs to anyone. We splurged with dessert of key lime pie and a banana split.  The split included three large scoops of (what appeared to be) homemade ice cream and topped with caramelized pecans.  The key lime was tart and delicious. The portion sizes were perfect and considering the careful preparation and unique flavors the price was appropriate.  Its a little more expensive that I would like to put Grassroots into our weekly rotation, but I look forward to visiting it again and sample more items off the menu when the budget allows. * I didnt know what burrata was: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrata"
4,"Five Guys is good eats.  Weve been eating at this location frequently (perhaps too frequently!) since it opened. Honestly, I dont think the food here is any fresher than In & Out Burger, but I like the selection of toppings (can you say, ""fresh jalapenos!"") and the great selection of sodas. The peanuts are a nice touch to get you warmed up for the Main Event while you wait. I personally think its a little over-the-top to decorate the place in nothing but rave reviews (WE GET IT ALREADY!!), but the cool music makes up for the lack of ambience. Since the Zagat announcement earlier this week, its been mobbed.  Try to avoid peak hours, unless you want to wait for a table. Five Guys is definitely pricier than In & Out, but I think the selection of ingredients justifies the premium. 3 tips: -Our family of 4 (2 adults, 2 kids under 10) can make do with one order of fries, though the orders have gotten smaller than when they first opened. -Ditto for the burgers.  Dont let the moniker ""Little Cheeseburger"" fool you.  I got the regular burger...once.  But the ""Little"" one is perfectly sufficient for me, especially after I load up on toppings. -Cant decide between the regular fries and the tasty Cajun fries?  Ask for a half-half order and ""POOF!"", youll get it! Enjoy! UPDATE: Gotta drop em to 4 stars.  The last several visits, the fries have been soggy.  Once they were even opaque in the center --- not cooked!  Ask for them EXTRA CRISPY!!"
3,"Not the best burger Ive ever had, but a fun place to try with the coworkers on a Friday afternoon. I had the quadruple bypass and a few helpings from the all-you-can-eat fry station. Better than BK/McDs, but nothing to write home about. The waitresses were hot and they happily wheeled me out to my car in a wheelchair! But its more of an attraction than anything else."
4,"I am just providing a review for the Mother and Infant Care Department only, since my wife has just had our second baby delivered here. We really enjoy our stay at this hospital. The facility is very clean and nice. Room are good size with shower box inside bathroom, so you can take shower during your stay and care for the mom. During the stay, Mom and the caregiver are entitle to have breakfast, lunch, and dinner for free. All you have to do is call and place your orders. The foods are quite quality and the portions are decent. I am really impressed with this. The nurses are all knowledgeable, caring, and nice. They are always there when you call them and need them. Since this is our second child, it works out perfectly that the nurses only come by when we call them or when they do their routine checks. So, the rest of the time you are left alone to rest. The hospital where my first child was born was different. They let lots of interns and students come to our rooms all the times for training, so we were constantly bothered.  However in my opinion, if it is your first child, you may find that having people around all the time could help you not to worry too much (since we all know nothing when the first child come). The reason I didnt give this hospital 5 star is just because our discharge was taking so long. We thought we would be out by 11 AM, but we didnt get out until 3 PM... They said that because it was on Sunday.  I think it make sense. Overall, I do recommend this hospital for any new mother."
5,"BEST PANCAKES!!! We want the recipe. Theyre newly remodeled and better than ever. Always great bagels but now they have added more menu items, more choices. Great food, great people!"
1,OMG! what is the rave about? this place is disgusting! its dirty and the food is not worth it! i came here with my family and we each order a little bit of everything that is suppose to be good and popular there. unfortunately everything is bad. i walked by the waiters and they were all cursing really loud in vietnamese to each other. the table is icky and it smell like my cooked up oil . ick! go to Pho ao sen instead at least its clean.
5,"I dont drink a lot of coffee, but Im a fan of tea. Especially strange tea that I probably cant pronounce right. Oh, and I like it when it smells like scotch. Yep, Im a fan of Lapsang Souchong. But Im not a fan of ""foofy"". And thats one thing that Tea infusion is not. Its not foofy. Its funky. Its fun. And everyone who works there is really friendly. Beyond the teas, the food is good, too. I dont know that Id eat there every night, but its a wider variety than Id expect at a tea place. This is a regular stop of mine. Makes Tempe Markeplace worth it!"
5,"Thats Amore is awesome! Im glad to see that a nice, clean and friendly local place is being supported and recognized. It deserves the five star ratings- the gelato tastes fresh and you really experience all of the flavor. Its a nice place to ride your bike to and get a refreshing treat when it gets hot."
4,"Always good beer and good food. Well let me say the food is not super fantastic but its better than a lot of brewery food out there. Spinach dip is good, nachos are always a staple, burgers could use a re-do. Salads are pretty good, pizza is mediocre. Wings are not half bad!! Sauce is pretty fiery! Nice!! Not a wussy sauce here! But I do love this place and the patio. Beers you cant go wrong with. Very flavorful good beers. All I ask is just a bit more quality in the food. Thats all thats wrong IMO or not really wrong but something they could improve on."
5,"This place was the answer to my German grocery shopping dreams! I thank the Yelp community for leading me to Old Heidelberg. I was picking up a number of items for an Oktoberfest party I was cooking for and hosting at my house, and was able to fulfill most of my exotic German needs at this one stop. I picked up pumpernickel rye bread, authentic concentrated Maggi Würze seasoning (not the soy sauce-tasting stuff you find in most American grocery stores) and Knorr zwiebel-kräuter salat krönung. They also had lots of Knorr sauce mixes that you just cant find over here (for instance,  sauerbraten gravy). I stuck around for a few minutes to talk to the two women who ran the place (Andrea and Chris). I volunteered that I had lived in Germany for years, including Berlin and Bavaria.  They were totally friendly and even suggested some other places nearby that I could check out for German grub or rarer German beer selections. I promised I would be back... especially since I spotted that they had frozen leberknödel (liver dumplings). I made these once from scratch years ago but that was a lot of work. Knowing that they carry such delicacies has snagged me hook, line and sinker, as I am now destined to return and once again indulge my German food fantasies."
3,This place is pretty good. better than average but not great. Fish fry on Fridays is ok if you like DEEP battered fish. nice atmosphere lots of TVs. Uquiel Beer on Tap
1,"We checked out RnR on Sunday (just a few days after opening.) In all fairness, I have to agree with many of the other reviews. Even though they are new, these things are fixable so hopefully the feedback will be taken in the appropriate vein. The building is very cool and the vibe was energetic on a sunny Sunday morning. There was an abundance of waiters but they seemed to be confused and frenetic without a real focus on the customer. The menu is very limited and our server had not eaten most of the items. He was struggling to explain. Our drinks took more than 15 minutes to arrive even though we saw them sitting at the bar for the entire time. Our water had just disappeared. Then the food. I ordered the grill cheese ( a rare treat and when I order it I want it good!). It was cold and overwhelmed by heavy bread. The cheese wasnt melted. I sent it back and they simply nuked it and brought it out. Icky. Our son wanted a kids cheeseburger and the staff kept coming back and forth not sure if there was a single burger or sliders for kids. It became comical after the third person came out. My husband ordered a salmon omelet with several additional fixings. The eggs tasted like box eggs and it was lackluster and flavorless. We even took the time to provide feedback to management but we got a weak smile and ""come back and try us again."" He made no effort to ""make things right"" either by comping something else to taste or providing an incentive to come back. There are too many restaurants in town to have to go to one that is less than mediocre. The young crowd may enjoy it for the bar vibe it gives but the majority of the tables on Sunday am were families or middle aged and we saw similar responses at other tables."
5,"Oh Chipotle, I love you.  Healthy options even when craving Mexican!  My favorite is the chicken burrito bowl with fajita veggies.  Served on a bed of rice with black beans and pico de gallo, with some spicy corn thrown in....ahh my mouth is watering already.  Ive been to many locations, and all are clean, food quality is excellent, service is friendly and professional, and I always leave satisfied.  5 stars to you, my friend."
5,Good micro brew made right there. Food is good as well.
4,"My date and I started in the basement which was super cozy. While waiting, we were distracted by the amazing aroma of food surrounding us from other tables. Once we sat down, we could NOT make a decision about what to order--everything looked so good. Our server was very helpful in aiding us with picking appropriate sized plates (we were starving and nervous we wouldnt have enough haha). We left with a to go box and no room for dessert! Loved it. Cant wait to go back. GREAT date night spot. But we prepared to wait and have a drink, this place is busy for good reason."
4,"The coffee is excellent. The vegan peanut butter cookies are to die for and I generally loath all things vegan. I just tend to believe some things are meant to have milk and eggs in them...oh, and DO NOT get between me and a good steak, you may lose a hand! Anyways, luv all the independent art & designers. Right now I am coveting those adorable litttle robot sculptures. Oh no, I sense another collection/obsession coming on.....do robots get along with owls?"
5,"Why oh why cant there be one of these closer to my house?! I would take them any day over Subway. Their bread is fresh, their meat and cheese is sliced perfectly thin. This may sound strange too, but every Mr. Goodcents Ive been too has the BEST soda fountain Coke. Okay...I said it. Judge me.  I do prefer the Mr. Goodcents over in Tempe off of 48th Street, but this one is just as good."
4,"Nice ambiance, nice authentic spicy chinese food.   As good as you can get here in Arizona;  it aint L.A or San Fran, but does a good job to satisfy the craving for real chinese.   Of all the Cofco asian restaurants, this is one of the more presentable ones to bring business clients or a new date, if ambiance is key to scoring positive brownie points.       For some bizarre reason, on the weekends, it is filled with asian-women/white guy couples,    which strikes me as hilarious.  If it wasnt for this,  I would eat there multiple times a week.  Asian woman orders from real chinese menu;  her white guy orders from chow mein menu.   Side note:  Get a grip; asian women check each other out, and  usually not in a nice way--like in a sizing you up-comparing you to herself way--so I usually end up losing my appetite when I catch one of them staring at me (and my man) and whispering to her white guy or her girlfriends about me;  yah, I understand the shit you say about me, asian girls, because I speak your language too, hello!   So I compensate for my chinese food cravings by quick carry out.  Works like a charm every time.  Im happy, my own Cracker is happy.  Owner gets lots of business and is happy.    We all win."
5,"So my coworkers and I decide we want donuts on a Weds. I know typically donuts are on Fridays but what the hay. In my search for a really good donut I go to the Internet and Google ""best donuts"" and low and behold Bosa Donuts comes up. They have 3 locations, and the one in Chandler has 12 reviews, which all raved about how great Bosa Donuts were. So I notice they have a location at 35th Ave and Glendale! I had seen it many times but never stopped in thinking it was just the average run of the mill donut shop. Boy was I wrong!  Bosa Donuts is by far the best donut I have had in a very long time, maybe ever! I stopped by for a dozen this morning and bought a little something special for myself. I got to the car and took one bite and was in heaven. The what I would call a Cinnamon Fry with crumb topping was to die for. What I liked the most was it was not greasy like some other donut shops. (I wont mention any names, you know who you are!) Lightly crisp on the outside and so tender on the inside. The crumb topping was just the icing on the cake. It was all I could do not stop and get some milk so I could utterly devour the rest of my donut on the way to work. I did have a bite of an Apple Fitter after getting to work and it was very yummy too. They have many varieties and some wonderfully looking croissants too. If you have not tried Bosa Donuts in Phoenix you are missing out!"
5,"I love Tempe Marketplace and frequent it regularly.  It has many dining, shopping, and entertainment options.  It is an outdoor mall and in the summer there are misters and in the winter heat lamps and a large fire pit.  It has stores that are usually only found in malls such as Tillys, American Eagle, and Victorias Secret, but also freestanding stores such as Target, Best Buy, and Ulta.  There are a large variety of restaurants and a Harkins Movie Theater as well.  It is a great place to hang out with friends and see the local night life!"
3,"Sorry, I really just dont get it. I didnt hate it and Im not hating on it now, but I dont see what all the fuss is about. * Pizzas slapped together resulting in uneven, soggy crusts. Our party ordered 5 of the 6 available. * Psychological warfare of having to wait forever for just a few tables maintains an air of pompous superiority that tricks the famished patrons into reporting the pizza is a lot better than it really is. Waiter actually boasted about the 3 to 4 hour Saturday night wait, which we got around by having reservations! * Bottles of iced tea and other drinks bought in bulk rather than any alternative that would make more sense. Good? Not bad... Best in the Phoenix Valley? HIGHLY debatable, but personally I really cant say that I think so... Best is the USA? Impossible, theres just no way. LGO is better. Cibo is better. Spinatos is better. Most hyped? Most definitely."
3,"Bizarre location with good food. Dont expect an ""environment"". Its poorly decorated but looks as if there is a rockin karaoke setup there. Still, I liked it."
4,"You dont come for the run-of-the-mill pizza. Nor do you show up for the cheap pitchers of beer. No, you make it here for the show. A massive organ fills the entire building, incorporating dozens of intruments, and the virtuosos playing it take center stage. Sit back and watch then perform your favorite songs, from Star Wars to The Little Mermaid. Dont let the average food dissuade you from a one-of-a-kind experience."
5,"My son comes here for the tacos but I am all about the chile relleno.  I never had one with potatoes inside, but oh my, this was the best!  My only recommendation would be to order it dry, with the sauce on the side.  I am counting the days until I get back to AZ.  The new location is so much closer to us, I plan on trying all of their menu, but....but... that chile relleno is ....calling....me.......! The tacos were very very good though."
5,"The people at this title company are as good as it gets. They are eager to do a really good job for the agents that use them.  Bill Risser and Paul Guenther are techno pros regarding the Social Media techniques and readily share their expertise and time to teach the skills of Twitter, Facebook, Hootsuite, and  other aspects of Social Media which agents can utilize to serve their clients in a diligent and efficacious manner.  The buyers and sellers of  property will really gain by using them because their handling of the transaction will be efficiently and quickly finished."
4,"They had amazingly quick service during lunch! The servers were VERY polite, almost to the point of being obnoxious. I ordered the daily special--bacon cheeseburger--which came out hot, fresh, and delicious, though the fries were heavily over-salted. Our drinks were also quickly refilled without us asking, which was nice but unfortunately their tea basically tasted like water. Overall, it was a good experience and I would come back again."
4,"Good pizza, nice place & the owner was very accommodating. Im a fan."
5,"Old school style butcher shop that has great service and a great selection.  You will pay more, but you can sign up for their emails and get the monthly and weekend specials.  Often there are coupons for BOGO or a few bucks off your purchase.  They also have a good selection of beer and wine, side dishes, and some supplies for home BBQ and smoking.  After reading the other reviews, I know my hubby and I need to try the jerky.  We always enjoy shopping at Von Hansons."
5,Best donuts I have ever had.
4,"Sorry for my lateness but I wanted to update everyone that after my review I was contacted by management, apologized to, and asked back for another chance. I WILL be back just as soon as it cools down and update my review then. Everyone deserves a second chance to make things right. I appreciate the professionalism and attention to customer service. Im looking forward to it."
2,"Okay...this was very surprising since it was just voted Best Southwestern food in PHX mags Best of the Valley issue...and thus, it made us want to have a visit. I LOVE southwestern food...and I was very let down by this place.  I feel like I should give it 3 stars...but as an ""A-OK"" rating, I just cant.  If 3 stars were for ""OK food"" then Id give it 3 stars.  But truly, I have...I have had better. PHX Mag said to try the crab cakes, which we did, and they were delicious.  Very happy with them and therefore expected the entrees to be just as great...but they werent.  : (  I had the salmon, which the waitress recommended and it was such a bummer.  It had way too many conflicting tastes going on that didnt seem to blend at all.  I lost my appetite after a few bites.  My boyfriend had the shrimp tacos which were just...average.  We were really disappointed.   Again, the crab cake appetizer was great and the two margaritas were as well - the Tontorita and the Prickly Pear - both very, very yummy.   But overall, if PHX Mag continues to recommend more lame-oid meals, Im gonna have to start using it as wrapping paper instead of a go-to guide for great meals in this town."
2,"I was here once. A reasonably sized girl broke her white plastic lawn chair and tumbled to the ground. I averted my gaze and tried to focus on my overpriced mediocre eggs benedict. My friend just laughed and laughed. I guess I should have ordered the mimosas, too."
1,"Should be called The Bad Egg. Bottom line, the hotels free breakfast tasted better than this and we got better service there.  We arrived around 945am on a Sunday morning and had to wait around seven minutes to be seated. The staff was pleasant enough. We were seated, given menus with water and she took our order for coffee and the breakfast special (loaded potato skillet). We sat for 15 minutes before we saw our waitress again. She finally figured out she forgot to bring our coffee. We finally got some coffee which was mediocre in flavor. Our food arrived about ten minutes after that. The skillet was supposed to contain sausage, bacon, onion, scrambled eggs, grilled american potatoes covered with cheese and sour cream. Mine had no bacon, two tiny chunks of sausage, no cheese, and the potatoes were so soggy, they tasted like someone had thawed them and thrown them in as an afterthought. It was so unpalatable i could not eat more than one bite, even after loading it up with salt and hot sauce. The waitress never checked on us once during the meal. She came back by the time my husband was finished. I told her the meal was horrible (in a nice way). She offered me something else. By that point, I was not feeling like eating anything else, I felt kinda sick. My meal was comped and we did get an apology. The manager explained that everyone LOVES that special and the potatoes are seasoned and grilled. The cook obviously didnt try my potatoes. Blech. Even with the comp, the total was over $15 for one special and two coffees. Very hight priced for nasty food, poor service, and loud/uninspiring atmosphere."
5,"One, two Feddys coming for you! ""Three, four better lock your door!"" ""Five, six pick up a crucifix!"" ""Seven, eight better stay up late!"" ""Nine, ten if Freddy Kruger went to Lush hed have had great skin!"" Dude, this place is AMAZING! All of their products are all natural, freshly made without preservatives, and are just incredible.  My best friend and  went here after a four martini lunch plus shopping, and we had a had treatment done with their Ocean Salt Cleaner and exfoliator.  It is made with sea salt and smells just like a margarita!  his was followed by using their dream cream, and now I am hooked!  And its not just the martinis!  I have very sensitive skin, and I have never had a reaction.  They also have a great mens line as well.  I have been using the Ambrosia Shaving Cream for men as well on my face, and I have no razor burn.  It is like a light cream that moisturizes while I shave.  Wow!  I have never felt good after a shave! Anyway, I could gush all day about this place, but the bottom line is it has incredible products that are all natural, and many are vegan,  the staff is amazingly helpful and not at all phony, and even though it may seem expensive the products last for a long time, so the cost is really not that high.  Get thee to Lush!"
4,"Great food, great price, very awesome lunch specials.  I would have given 5 stars but the service is normally a bit fast and some of the wait staff are a bit pushy!!  All in all, great value."
4,"I recently stayed at the Valley Ho for a conference being held on-site. My experience was really nice, everything from the food to the retro style room to the poolside atmosphere.  Cafe ZuZu has an assorted lunch selection and Trader Vic was only a short on-site walk where I enjoyed their happy hour. The front desk, catering and valet staff were helpful and provided outstanding service to all the guests.  When scheduling future company events I will definitely keep the Valley Ho in mind."
4,Very nice place with extremely friendly staff.  The food was similar quality to other Mexican food places in the NW Valley....good but not spectacular.   Very good portions for the price.   I dont live close by but will certainly go back when I am in the area.
4,Dont know why it took me this long to check out Joes Farm Grill but my out-of-towners got a kick of this place. We ordered : Fontina Burger - 4* BBQ Chicken Pizza - 4* Grilled Veggie Pizza - 3* Sweet Potato Fries - 2* Garlic Fries - 4* Onion Rings - 5* Chocolate Milk Shake - 2* The good: - great selection of American food / good portion sizes - allow upgrades to different kinds of fries to your meal - the decor & cute history behind the farm - open kitchen / sauce bar - friendly staff  - outdoor picnic benches under a huge tree where the kiddies can enjoy themselves - hand washing fountain conveniently located by the soda fountain - kiddies love the cool restrooms  The bad:   - lots of flies outside (thats summer in a farm for you) - limited seating inside - real vanilla milkshake tasted weird ( too much lemon juice?)
5,"This place is everything a sports bar should be. Lots and lots of TVs...for one. I love being able to watch 4 different sports and play trivia all at the same time. The drink specials are pretty decent. Theyre not a dollar or anything, but the big beers are cheap on happy hour. The food is great! So far Ive only tried the spinach dip, wings and their all-you-can-eat fish & chips. All of them were seriously delicious! These types of food are pretty standard in sports bars but Ive definitely had my fair share of unfortunate food items from other places. These certainly surpassed my expectations. And last but not least, their star of the show, Debbie. One of the best bartenders Ive ever seen. She runs that bar like a champ, knows nearly every face that walks through that door, and pours great drinks. And by great, I mean a good stiff drink thats not so strong that you cant taste anything else in it. We frequent this place quite often, and for good reason. Do yourself a favor and stop in!"
4,this place will kind of throw you off when you first step with the wall nic nacs and the display that sells body wash and toothpaste next to chop sticks and such but the food is surprisingly delicious.. my husband order the chicken curry friee rice with orange chicken and he loved it. i had the chicken and beef chop suey and was not disappointed. kudos to this joint could do with some spring cleaning and a little sprucing up but good all the same
3,"I really try to like Old Town Scottsdale - and if you look past all the God-Awful tourist traps it is actually quite a nice place with a number of top notch dining options - but in the end you can only walk by so many mass-produced ""native"" jewelry shops with ""Bargains"" before it all starts blending together.  Parking is generally a travesty but can be found if youre willing to wait it out and the public art is a nice touch.  For my dollar - go, grab a spot, and kill some time at Cartel, grab some local foods at Bodega, and maybe consider a bite at one of the locally owned restaurants like FnB or Praying Monk, and skip any place with turquoise jewelry in the window while focusing on the galleries that dont quite seem to fit the theme."
1,"I bought a deal off of Living Social and waited a while to call them, figuring theyd be swamped with business. Now I cant get them to call me back so I can use my deal. (NOTE: There were no reviews of this company on Yelp BEFORE the Living Social deal.) Of course, Living Social is no help - their website says I need to call a consumer advocate in my area. This kind of thing, I predict, will be the demise of every deal-of-the-day site: the company selling the deal bears no risk of having to pay refunds if the business providing the goods or services doesnt perform. I have since cancelled my subscriptions to EVERY deal-of-the-day email out there. Lesson learned about TWO companies with no ethics."
5,"Absolutely LOVE spicy pickle! Sandwiches are great (always make sure to get them HOT!) Pickles are awesome too!  Food is consistent and really good. Good variety, and you can easily make your own sandwich with a ton of choices. Good breads, meats, cheeses, toppings, sauces. Overall a really good sandwich!"
4,"So the other day, I was in the mood for sushi at my usual spot (Sakana).   Unfortunately, they were closed for lunch, so the next choice was some pasta at Caffe Boa next door.  Also closed for lunch.  Double Shit!!   Pasta Pomodoro?  Their tortellini alfredo rocks!!  Then I find out all of their AZ locations closed.  Triple shit!!   Stomach is growling and quickly getting pissed off.  Okay, Haji Baba then.   Bessie gets me there in record time but alas, the place was PACKED, even for a 2pm lunch.  What to do?   Wait...theres that little Vietnamese joint a few doors down, that Ive always wanted to check out but just never did. Well, I guess they say better late than never for a reason.  I popped in, grabbed a seat and was quickly served up one of my favorite Vietnamese dishes.  Deelish is all I can say.  Now Ive got a new little spot to add to my local list of favorites."
3,"Tried this for dinner one night.  Had the hot and sour soup, which was good.  Partner had the won ton soup, but had to ask for crispy won tons to add to the soup.  I had a diet coke to drink, but I swear there was alcohol in the glass - I sent it back and the same happened again.  i tasted my partners and hers was fine - not sure what was going on there. I had kung pao beef - it was a little too crispy.  My partner had the shrimp version (she wanted scallops but they were out !) - she said it was excellent. Liked the decor, but a bit pricey for what you got."
5,"If your day is lacking a good decision, this place will change the course of your life - at least for an hour. I have only ever ordered the Oggie (Im a one pasty kind of guy), but most of my friends have had their way with the rest of the menu and it doesnt disappoint. Easily one of my favorite spots in Tempe.  Its also a much larger version of its former self so you no longer have to gladly wait an hour for a table."
2,"What is the big deal about this place?! Its not great, but pretty good. Not bad, but ok. Just is what it is. We had some wings and a stuffed pizza, and the wings were undersized yet pretty flavorful. The pizza, I just dont understand the hype. Maybe Ive had Giordanos, Ginos, and Lou Malnatis too much in Chicago but this place just wasnt it. The pizza is okay, and just okay... if nothing else, WAY too salty. After a while, I felt like I was consuming a salt lick. Service was weird, and Im pretty sure our server was on coke. the restaurant was PACKED and the place was buzzing and he came and sat at our table and started shooting the shit. It was very bizzare. We got someone elses order of wings, and didnt know they werent ours until the server told us (after we had eaten them all) so we felt kind of bad.  Id go back here again but I wouldnt really be too eager to."
4,"A perfect way to top of an exotic shopping experience at 99 Ranch.  The Taiwan Express has photos of many (not all) of their dishes. Very authentic.   Also try some shaved ice for desert (brought me back to Singapore!).  My kids love the shaved ice, though they are more used to Asian foods than most kids.   Note that the Buffet section (to the left) is better than any mall food courts, and may be more tame for some taste buds.   AND - in between the buffet and Taiwan Express you can buy a whole roast duck for about $12.50, which they will cut up for you.  Be sure to buy some Plum Sauce (elsewhere in the store) for a sweet dipping sauce for the duck (yummy!)."
4,"Yes, Im a fan this place but it definitely does not deserve a 5 star rating.  First off lets start with the decor.  While it was very nice when it first opened its now getting a little raggedy looking and could use some updating.  Food wise this buffet is above average and definitely worth a visit.   If I could give them some advice it would be to get rid of  the HUGE salad buffet section or at least scale it way down and put that money into even more entree selections.  Ive been coming here ever since they opened and hardly ever see anyone eating off the salad section.  So why spend so much money to have such a huge selection???   Put that money into the entree selection and make this place an even better value.  And for Gods sake bring back the Mayonnaise Shrimp !!  You made one of the best versions Ive ever tasted."
3,"Zipps has good bar food, but the service is usually horrible. The waitresses rarely come to your table. BUT, what really rubs me the wrong way is this.... On multiple occasions, when I pay the bill, the waiter doesnt bring me back the correct change. Even if my change is 1 cent, Im entitled to receive my money back.  Im sorry, but not giving me back my  change because you deem it insignificant doesnt float well with me. They do have great food though."
3,"if you want a really filling, delicious ""please-make-my-head-stop-feeling-like-its-about-to-explode"" hangover cure, there guys have got the remedy!  the hangover helper is all of the above and gets even better when you add the hair of the dog bloody mary for an extra $3! (they also have live music on sundays during brunch!) the architecture and windows are stunning in this place - if youve never been in here, its worth checking it out!"
5,"So far, I have been to Lola twice (a Saturday night and Monday morning). Saturday night was very quiet compared to the super busy Monday morning. Free Wi-Fi, coffee, baked goods, and awesome location...you cant beat it. The morning we went, we had a Monterrey Jack scone that was really good. I laughed when I got my latte in a ""So I Married an Axe Murder""-esque cup. We sat along the high tables facing Central Ave and I really enjoyed surfing the internet and looking out towards Central. There are various types of seating as well as some outdoor tables. I really loved this place but worry that it will be one of those places that will be so popular, youll never get to sit there. That is why I stopped going to Lux because it eventually got so crowded all of the time. My favorite part of Lola coffee is being right on Central and watching traffic and the light rail go past. Love it, love it."
4,"Ive been to Padres several times with local friends and have always enjoyed the food and atmosphere.  This time my table mates included my brother and sister-in-law who were visiting from the east coast.  And who do they always count on for recommending awesome places to eat while in town?  Yup...me.  The pressure was on.  From the opening appetizers of guacamole, salsa, chips, and margaritas to our main dishes, the food was great.  The staff was extremely friendly, including our waiter Chico who kept us laughing.  I am normally a Salmon Spinach Enchiladas guy but decided to go out of my comfort zone with the West Coast Burrito.  Strange combination but it really works well together.  And what did my out-of-town guests think about Padres?  Loved it."
4,"I absolutely love the atmosphere and vibe of Switch.  Ive been there 3 times, once for a latenight snack (before they were serving alcohol) and twice for breakfast.  My favorite thing about it is that I feel completely comfortable going by myself with a book and lingering over breakfast and coffee. Service is always very quick and super friendly, and prices are good.  Unfortunately, as much as I love GOING to switch, I have to be honest and say I havent been wowed by the food so far, although I still need to try lunch/dinner.  Foods not bad, not at all, just nothing spectacular. Having said that though, Ill still go back often!"
3,"Pei Wei is always busy, thats gotta mean something right? Wrong. There are restaurants that serve billions yet all they serve is a gross mystery. Pei Wei is no mystery though, the food is cooked in an open air kitchen. Even so, if there were such a thing as Asian fast food, Pei Wei would be cleaner version of it. Most Pei Weis are situated in pompous locations where ever there is an AJ Fine Foods, but atleast they arent located in the ghetto. As far as the food goes, it is about as Americanized as you can get. So if you live in America and have American taste buds, it will appeal to you. Unfortunately if you want authentic Asian food you wont find it at Pei Wei. I dont understand why they even bother to put chopsticks on the table, the rice isnt even sticky enough to pick it up with. They are for decoration. They are part of the fake Asian dining experience. Apparently, Pei Wei serves food ""manadrian style"" from Thailand, Vietnam, Japan, Korea, and China. In the words of Bill Lumbergh, ""Ooo.. yeahh.. Im just not sure about that."" Having traveled to China I can honestly tell you that Chinese food is different. Apart from the rice, the food lacks vegetable oil and garlic. In China those two ingrediants are used in many dishes and Pei Wei lacks them. When I first started visiting Pei Wei I ordered the Sweet and Sour, but I got sick of it. Sometimes the meat would be tough, sometimes the chicken would clump together all nastily. What I get now-a-days and what I got on this particular day was Mandarin Kung Pao. Even though the dish is spicy, that doesnt mean it has to be dry - and it was. What it was missing was some catalyst to bring out the spicy flavors and make them more vibrant. The dishes at Pei Wei are family style meaning they are meant to be shared with several people. A dish and a drink will end up costing you about $10. If each person gets one dish, thats a lot of food, probably enough to feed a small village in Africa somewhere. It would be nice if they served each dish in two styles, family and single, large and small. Family style is great if you always visit Pei Wei with your family. But if you are out for lunch with people from work you might not want to share your food with your co-workers. They arent your family. You dont know them. Pei Wei is a modern Asian diner that is probably better than most of the mom and pop Asian diners out there, even if most of the food is cooked by Mexi-- I mean Asians."
3,Kimchi - 5 stars. Other side dishes - OK. there is no date on it so I really dont know how fresh they are. I went there couple times to get side dishes other than Kimchi. it was not as good as Paldo. I only go to Seoul Market for Kimchi now.
3,"A  bit surprised at the high prices but figured that the ""trendy factor in old town"" and the atmosphere was the reason because the teeny portions of the food and the quality is just GOOD, like the Good egg, not great, not bad, just good.  No happy hour? And Too dark inside.  Lots of pretty wait staff.  My first suggestion would be to fire grill the mahi tacos and not batter them, they were not that flavorful. The side dishes of street corn and some potato chorizo thing were very good. I wanted to try the guac, but 12 bucks for an avacado with some garlic and cilantro? How about trying to make a good ceviche? My hubby and i thought that Rubios rocks in comparison, we love the shrimp tacos and the pablano and portobello tacos."
4,I really enjoy this place and have eaten there several times. They just recently changed their menu but I like the brew additions. The coconut shrimp are awesome and the ahi tuna salad is to for for!  I did have the chimichurri flank steak sliders but they werent good. Our waitress was great and offered me something else.
4,Decent place for pizza.  The only place in the West Valley to get decent Margherita pizza.  Not the best but good enough to satisfy.
5,Ohhh this is the best place ever! Every thing I have ordered has been delish!
5,"great service, great food, and great outdoor seating made for a wonderful first time experience at this charming little restaurant. you would think that sitting outside eating in the middle of august summertime in phoenix would be practically unbearable. local breeze made it tolerable and i dont think my overly-sweaty ass ever felt uncomfortable once during the whole dining experience. they had fans, a swamp cooler, and misters going and it made for a comfortable and charming outdoor dining venture. we started off with the greek lavosh which was to die for. the cheese they melted on top of it will make any cheese lover weak in the knees. their mojiot lemonade was crisp and refreshing. ok selection of beers, certainly not the greatest but i picked out a favorite, kiltlifter, to go with my coca-cola ham sandwich. my girlfirned (Rachel O.) went with the atomic burger as we are both fans of spicy food and this burger comes topped with horseradish. it even made her face scrunch up and me quiver in my seat the moment it hit my tongue and you better believe i enjoyed every second of it. the coca cola ham was HUGE and both of us only managed to eat half of it. leftovers are always good. service was spot on, and i enjoyed the decor and atmosphere despite what many people have complained about before. get over it, its no longer pallete, move on, and enjoy the local breeze."
3,"Bar Smith has potential to be a chic hot spot in the heart of downtown; just a few steps away from the symphony hall, Chase Field, and the US airways Arena. However, this place, despite its pseudo-hipness fails to deliver in the cocktail department, which, with its continuously crappy music, would be the only real reason youd come to this bar. Its really a 2.5 star place-- bartenders are nice,but dont really get the job done. When youre paying over $8/drink, youd at least expect them to do that. The roof is cool though so an extra .5 stars for that."
4,"Alright, well seeing as I work right next door, my mouth has been watering over this place ever since I laid eyes upon the menu. And tonight, we finally had some yummy Rumbi take-out. First things first: theyre a little pricey, at first glance. However, their portions are *enormous*. Each of us ordered a full size bowl(Honey Orange Shrimp for me, Jamaican Jerk Kalua Pork for Jamie, Honey Orange Kalua Pork and Teriyaki Chicken for Jamies parents). The full size bowls were more than enough to last the average person through dinner, and then through lunch the next day; packed full of rice/noodles, meat, and veggies, with each bowl containing a ramekin of sweet teriyaki sauce. The shrimp in my bowl was perfectly tender and succulent, the Honey Orange sauce sweet, but not cloyingly so. The bowl came with a lime wedge, which added the perfect zing to the mellow coconut ""Rumbi rice"". We also ordered some of their Bahama Mamas Tortilla Soup, which was a creamy coconut-based broth filled with chunks of grilled chicken, tortilla strips, and melty mozzarella. It was a good, cozy soup, but could have benefited from more depth--some tang, some spice, something. For dessert, we had some of Rumbis Key lime pie--moist, rich, and delectably sweet with a lovely measure of sour. Only complaint? The graham cracker crust was too mushy, soft, and crumbly; it would have been much better with a crispy bed under the pillowy-ness of the Key lime filling. All in all? Great place with reasonable prices, given their generous portions. They have a TON of salad options, as well, each more inventive than the last, and Ill be returning to try and test each one :)"
5,"Very good place for breakfast & lunch tucked away in the crowded shops at 44th & Camelback.  I kinda found this place on accident.  I meant to just run into AJs and grab a salad to go, but was forced to park basically across the driveway from Taylors, and, being closer, I opted to go there instead.   Taylors is open 6-4ish (I couldnt really tell, they probably just changed the hours and scratched off the hour number on the door), and they serve breakfast all day- well, all day theyre actually open- which is always good with me.   I was in the mood for corned beef, and , bingo, there it was.  Nice mound of lean tasty beef with melty cheese (no saurkraut or thousand island, please.).  And the bread- oh the bread- grilled to be crispy on the edges but still soft inside.  How in the hell do they do it?  I dont know, but Im in love."
4,"All around great.  Great food, great atmosphere and great location if you work in the downtown area."
5,This is a small location but still packed with everything I need.  They did start stalking more womens vitamins I liked without iron because they were always out when I went in.  So I thank them for that! Staff are always nice and for the most part an answer all of my questions.  They take an added effort to get to know their customers.  They always ask about my son when I go in and this keeps me coming back because I feel valued as a person not just a customer.
4,"Pretty yummy! I just went here for lunch and thought the pricing was the best feature. $6.95 for all entrees, which includes a bowl of spicy chicken soup (not sure of name). I ordered the Panang with pork and loved it. It had great flavor and the serving size was appropriate for lunch. Dont let the restaurants outside appearance scare you - the inside is not too bad. The servers were very nice and efficient. Ill be back, guaranteed, because they serve quickly and it works for my lunch hour."
2,"The upstairs theater is nice enough. There are a few nice semi-upscale restaurants here. Its also got a really good swanky (and somewhat hidden) bar here.  So why only 2 stars? Well, because it smells like this is where all the diarrhea in the world goes to die... especially the parking structure. If you can escape the smell though, this is a nice spot for a date. The problem with that is when you go walk her to her car, you have to try and figure out how to have a good night kiss while your nose is telling your brain that you are swimming in a septic tank. The new Waterfront mall corridor stinks like this as well. Maybe thats where the term ""filthy rich"" comes from. What do these people eat?"
4,"Stopped into this good-sized place for lunch today, with Mike C.  Its a little worn, but comfortable, & I counted up 81 regular food items.  All that I tried from the soup, salad, sushi, hot dishes, & dessert selections were good, & I particularly enjoyed these items: *  The Hot & Sour Soup! *  The Kim Chi! *  A tasty salad topping with broccoli, mushrooms, & more! *  The Seafood Salad! *  The Egg Foo Young! A good solid 4-Star place here!  Lunch Buffet $6.99, $6.29 Sr."
4,"At the ripe old age of 3, its time for my previous review to take a siesta. Over the course of that three years, Tempe Cameras only gotten better. The selections improved (finally finding a happy medium between film and digital), the prices are even better than they were, and I dare say service on the retail sides kickass too. TCR is now my go-to photo supplier as a working pro. Theyve either got what I need or can quickly get it, they still know their stuff, and they support both local photographic education and the local photo industry. Theyre also the only dealer in the Valley that sells Think Thank Photo products, which are best damn professional camera bags ever. And if youre an amateur, theyve got plenty of friendly, knowledgeable staff for you too. Dont be afraid to ask for someone else; like almost anywhere, they employ people of varying personalities. There are sales staff I dont click with at TCR, but I wouldnt classify anyone as distinctly rude. (If you want that, youll have to try B&H or Adorama.) If you need lots of hand-holding, the ASU crush probably means youll either want to shop at off hours or go to Photomark--TCR tries, but the crowd to counter ratio just isnt favorable at peak times. Repairs are still something they do very well at excellent prices. When Ive had equipment serviced, its been turned around quickly, relatively inexpensively, and works like brand new. Evaluation of your equipment is still free, as it should ideally be at every repair shop (but often isnt). The labs added a bunch of cool new services, including damn fine plexi mounting, and is doing a considerably better job with film than their old reputation for free scratches with purchase would suggest. Hundreds of frames processed with nary a scratch to be found. Rentals Im a little more ambivalent about.  Theyve thinned the herd out considerably (about half the rentals inventory has taken up residence in the used equipment case) and the selection of lighting equipment is basically unchanged, but theyve got the latest Canon and Nikon bodies, and everythings well-maintained and in good shape. Rates are good for what they do have--the questions just if they have what you want."
2,"Theatre is very nice. Seats are not as comfortable as you would think. They have like office chairs in every other row. Also the food is not good, and its so overpriced. Did you know it costs a dollar to put onions on your burger? Want cheese? Thats another dollar. And its not even good. Screen is beautiful and a clean picture though.. 3D was great."
3,"If you want a dog and are in the area, this is a pretty good call. Having said that, it is probably not worth a special trip. You can find a better hot dog or brat at a ballpark or in the supermarket."
5,"Coffee talk is a nice surprise nestled in the hum drum downtown of Mesa. I have been enjoying their coffee and live talent since I was fifteen. When I was in High School it was a ritual to hit the local dollar movie and then end the night with some coffee at coffee talk. I think the best part was hitting on boys and trying to pass as being at least eighteen years old. My reasons for going to Coffee Talk have changed over the past decade, but the atmosphere and quality drinks and pastries have not changed. There is nothing better than sitting on their back patio and enjoying the cool breeze of the fall. There is something about that place that brings me a sense of relaxation. If you enjoy artistic ambiance, coffee, and live performances then I would recommend Coffee Talk."
4,"If youre a fan of Postino, you have to make your way to Windsor pronto. The central Phoenix restaurant and bar is owned by Postino owner Craig DeMarco (and its right across the street from the central Phoenix Postino), and the atmosphere and vibe are similar to Postinos. Windsor also has an open dining room that extends to the patio, the lighting is also dim, and the servers are also hip. There was a 30-minute wait for my party of two on a recent Friday night, and we sat in the indoor dining area, which overlooked the bar, which was bustling full of people and had standing room only. The restaurant is located in an historic brick building, and it has a cool wall covered completely in cassette tapes that makes it feel even hipper. For food, my pal and I started with the Cheddar Fondue ($11) off the mostly-American menu, which comes with pretzels, apples, pork, bread and sausage. The pretzels were soft and chewy, and the portion was huge. I would have preferred just the pretzels, though the apples and cheese were an interesting combination. Definitely try that appetizer if you go-it was super-tasty. For my meal, I got the Veggie Stack ($9), which was a pita topped with bean spread, quinoa, tomato, cucumber, avocado, radish,  corn and green goddess (I left the pickled beets off). I thought the toppings were interesting both taste- and texture-wise, and that part of the meal seemed relatively healthy. I paired it with some macaroni and cheese, which I enjoyed, though my pal and I werent wowed. Maybe its because the cheese wasnt plentiful or creamy enough, but it was still good. My pal had the Porkwich sandwich ($12). He said he liked it a lot."
4,I finally tired another dish. The Panag Curry with tofu. It was great too. Rich thick curry crisp veggies and tons of flavor. One thing I am upset with its the new $1 fee to use a credit card for bills that are less than $10. So get a drink or bring cash...
4,"Fresh & Easy is the US subsidiary of UK based grocer Tesco who entered the American market in 2007.  I know Tesco really well and they are smart business folks who know their market.  Fresh & Easy has been opening stores all over the Phoenix area and have been using $20 and $10 coupons to build market share.  I give them a lot of credit for doing this. I also have been shopping here for a long time and appreciate their eye on packaging food items for the busy consumer.  One of my favorites is their rosemary focaccia bread dough.  Ive made it at home, but Fresh & Easy make it ohhh so easy when Im tired and its 6:45. BTW, thanks for the Hybrid parking space!"
2,"No way am I coming back here! The shoes seem to be made poorly, but I havent actually kept a pair of shoes and I never will because Im never coming back. I bought one pair because I thought they were cute, but quickly changed my mind so I returned them. Do you know how many people asked my WHY Im returning them? In a very rude manner, literally all the people who were working there. Not only did it make me uncomfortable but they lost a customer because of it as well."
4,"Ive been here so many times, I cant believe I havent reviewed Black Bear yet! This is me and my friends ""go-to"" breakfast place. Ginormous portions, and for a decent price. A little slow on the service, but if youre not in a hurry its no big deal. Basically down home cooking. You see diner and that is exactly what you get. Good eats!"
5,"This place never ceases to amaze. One of the best breakfast places in Phoenix. The Sicilian scramble is a favorite--though the smashed meatball was great. We finally went back for dinner the other night and for the first time I had a burger. It should not be surprising that is was fantastic. Atmosphere is great, service is great, and the food is great--just go!"
3,"Shaved noodles, shaved noodles, shaved noodles!  Am I too butt lazy if I only go for shaved noodles?  The dish ordered with the handpulled meant I had to hold chopsticks high into the air trying to separate a portion of noodles out onto our plates.  Not bad but wasnt special... but the shaved noodles, loved the chewy texture.  I unashamedly used my baby godson as an excuse to get a mini noodle pulling show at the window. Im going to work my way thru the fresh fruit juice offerings...  I used to drink that daily while working as an expat in HK.  Speaking of which, the bathrooms are sooooo HK grand (Amy L, you and I think alike!)... Overall the stir fried dishes were a bit greasy and the flavors decent, but the draw here is the shaved noodles (can I plug this anymore?!) and the fresh fruit juice."
4,"Valle is all about the ritas happy hour, chips and bean dip and an awesome patio, if you are looking to eat awesome pollo funditos well they have that too..."
5,"Great facial great customer service One Love Boutique Spa consists of the waiting room/reception area and the services room.  Its small, cozy but super cute and inviting. I love the way its decorated which is what drew me to buy a Groupon for a signature facial after looking at the website. The decor is white, clean, girly and classic. I was disappointed at first when my initial appointment was cancelled two hours before I was scheduled due to Amanda coming down with something that was contagious, I guess I was thankful too. When I came in for my facial I explained that I was one of the appointments that was rescheduled due to her illness and she upgraded me to the anti aging facial for free!  She also includes eyebrow waxing with every facial which is awesome! The facial was AMAZING and Amanda is very knowledgeable about what she is doing and the products she is using.  Before my facial started I had asked her to mess up my hair as little as possible since I was going somewhere right after, she kindly obliged  and when I left my hair looked exactly how it looked when I came in. Amanda is great and I will definitely be back!"
5,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE Paws Salon. I used to take my dog to Canine Preferred but the ladies at the front dest were flakey, so I thought Id try a new place and I am SO glad I did. The owner Tracy clearly has a passion for animals. Walking in you are greeted by a cat, dog, and Macaw that call the front of the shop home. You are able to see them grooming the dogs (a big plus for me, you never know what some places do behind closed doors). She is very professional and seems like a no bullshit kind of lady (in a good way). Shes to the point, tries to listen to exactly what you want and offers options and suggestions to help. They keep track of the previous cut that was given (its annoying some places you to have to tell them every time). I would highly recommend this pet salon. They also offer daycare, and overnight boarding. I cant want to try the daycare to socialize my pup some more! Cant go wrong at this salon.."
5,"I just stopped in tonight after the gym, I was a bit stinky and what better way to fix that than 16 bars of soap. It was late 8:15 when I walked in :15 before close. This is a great time to shop when you are in a rush. It was empty, and the lines were short. Despite benign the end of a long day the low turnover staff was great and personally recognized me and greeted me."
5,"As far as fast Japanese food at lunch this is as good as it gets.  They have a different Bento Box lunch special everyday.  The box comes with plenty to eat, including Miso Soup which arrives shortly after ordering.  The meal includes sushi, salad, rice, chicken (teriyaki or such), gyoza, some type of fried fish and an orange.  For about $8-$10 its hard to find a better deal.  I would highly recommend CherryBlossom for those looking for a Japanese meal.  It is small, quiet and a little hard to see from the street, which makes it a unique place with low traffic, but high quality."
3,"I tried a few different kinds of pizza and they were all okay.  A few people had told me that they made ""incredible"" pizzas, but I didnt really think so...Id say they were pretty good pizzas.  What I liked were the fresh tasting vegetables which topped some of the pizzas.  The cheese was a bit disappointing, especially since I dont think you can really go wrong with cheese...it just lacked flavor. All in all, I probably wouldnt go back...it just really wasnt all that impressive."
4,"In n Out, I dont know how to tell you this, but . . . Ive found someone else.  No, no, its not like that, it was nothing you did!  Your burgers with their fresh toppings are delicious... but sometimes I just need a little change of pace, maybe something with grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, and bacon... mmm... bacon.  Oh, sorry.  You want to know the name?  I dont see why that...  You insist?  Okay... its Five Guys. Oh!  Youre upset!  YOURE upset!  Well let me tell you what - Five Guys fries are delicious, whether they come in Cajun OR regular!  And I NEVER liked your fries, In n Out!  I just pretended to like them, but theyre skinny, kind of limp, never flavorful, and you dont get very many.  Five Guys cuts em thick, salts them up, and pours an extra scoop into the bag, how do you like that!  And they give you FREE peanuts to munch on while you wait.  You never give me anything! What?  No... youre right, Five Guys is a more expensive taste.  Thats true, it is over $10 for a burger, fries, and drink, as opposed to your $5.  And I do have to park in a garage that loosely resembles a labyrinth designed by Escher.  But if you eventually make it up to the restaurant, they VALIDATE.  You have NEVER validated me!  Oh, thats right, you have surface parking, but dont try to pretend thats a feature with the temperature hitting 100!  Youre ridiculous. Whats that?  Does Five Guys have milkshakes?  Uh... hm.  Milkshakes.  I never thought about that.  They dont.  Would you mind if I got my burger and fries from there and then came to you for the shake?  No?  Fine.  Youre so overprotective and hyper-traditional sometimes.  Live a little. I hope we can still be friends, In n Out, but I just think I need to see other burgers.  Please dont pelt me with limp fries when I turn my back."
3,"We (my husband, 2 friends and I) visited Tavola last night because of a Yelp review. We werent as enthusiastic. The service was great! We ordered 2 pizzas and 2 salads. The salads were fresh, that was a nice surprise, not bagged. The pizza was good. Crust was a thicker than we like. Not a bad experience at all just not quite what we expected after the 5 stars."
2,"This place used to be quite good but I think they may have had an ownership change recently.  Over the past 12 months or so we have seen the quality of the food and service level both drop to unacceptable levels. The food is overall average - the fajitas down right poor and the drinks very inconsistent.  They do get somewhat busy with a bar crowd but that too seems inconsistent so when they do get busy the service gets very bad. When service deteriorates the Manager (or owner, Im not sure) seems to hide from customers.  Overall, make the trip down to Shea Blvd and find much better at better prices."
2,"Being a Phoenix native, I almost felt embarassed that I only ate at Petes for the first time seven years ago.  I had gotten back from England and was trying to recreate the orgasmic fish and chips experience I had there. Petes was around the corner from my complex and after all, I DID see so many  of those ""Im Addicted to Petes Fish & Chips"" bumper stickers all around Tempe. I had to try it. I ordered the two fish combo, and my reaction was...what the..?..are they serious?  1.) The ""chips"" suuuuck. No salt, overcooked and stiff. I couldnt even eat them.  2) The two squares of fish I got were alright, but I may as well have gone to Safeway and bought a box of Gortons fish sticks.  3.) The red ""special sauce"".  Wtf? And you have to pay extra if you want tarter? Lame.  4.) No malt vinegar. Enough said.  Why there is such a collective hard-on for this place is beyond me. Its a laughably bad example of Fish and Chips."
3,"I have been to this place twice and I have had both extremes.   The Good: Shannon, California Sea Bass, Michelle (Managers) Customer Service The Bad: Fried Calamari, Our last waiters breath The first visit to this establishment was our encounter with Shannon.  Shannon was a pure delight as our waitress.  She made our first visit absolutely fun.  My wife had a tilapia dish that she was less than enamored with but I had the California Sea Bass and that tasted very good.  In fact, it was so good that I regretted not getting a glass of Chardonnay to go with it.  The fish had a very nice texture and taste. Our second visit was our first encounter with the fried calamari.  As our guest so eloquently said, ""If this was my first impression of fried calamari, I would not have liked it.""  The calamari was overcooked and there was so much oil running on the plate.  We called this issue to Michelles attention and she agreed 100% that the dish was not prepared properly.  She gave us a coupon to come back there and eat at any time.   However, our waiters breath was another story. Whenever he spoke, I could smell his pungent (trust me, a lot better than what I really wanted to say) breath to the point I almost donned a gas mask.  There are very few things that would cause me to lose my appetite.  His malodorous breath and the calamari with more grease than a Jiffy Lube accomplished the feat."
5,"I will continue to give this place five stars for so many reasons.  First, the menu is very creative, and offers a great variety of healthy food, with an Asian twist.  This time I had the shrimp curry, which had lots of fresh vegetables, and instead of a heavy cream curry, it was a much healthier broth curry.  We had the edamame dumplings again, which were as good as I remembered.  It was kind of cool to see Dr. Weil eating there last night.  Its good to know that he likes the place enough to dine there."
3,Its Pei Wei. The service and food are always satisfactory.
5,"Im not normally one to jump at reviewing a chain restaurant, especially when there are 3 subways all within a couple blocks of each other.  I felt it was necessary in this case.  My husband and I came here over the weekend after a lovely trip to the dog park.  The two guys working here on the lonely afternoon were awesome.  They were really nice and friendly, and quite chatty.  One of them started helping my husband and the other one was sweeping while I was deciding.  The sweeping boy apparently noticed I was ready and he quickly ran to the back, washed his hands, threw on gloves and asked me what I wanted.  WOW!  This type of service has never happened at the other locations, all of which I have been too.  He chatted with me as I told him what I wanted.  He also joked about my weird sandwich and made me laugh.  Its refreshing to see a couple guys working on a boring day and actually enjoying themselves.  They also have outdoor seating which are perfect to sit at and people watch on beautiful days.  We even met this incredible 90 year old guy who is blind and deaf in both ears but somehow managed to communicate with us perfectly.  He was much more lively than most twenty-somethings you meet.  Amazing.  Only in downtown do you meet people like that.  This is a great Subway.  Go here and skip the others."
5,"I just went here for the first time a week ago (visiting my parents who just moved to FH). A++ Great location, view of the fountain, outside seating, nice decor inside, really wonderful owner and a big menu of pastries, croissant, sandwiches, Italian sodas, and coffee. I had the egg salad sandwich (the croissant and egg salad was SO FRESH!!) with a side of potato salad was probably one of the top 3 potato salads Ive ever had! I also got an iced mocha which was just the way I like it, on the sweet side. I had my 14 month old daughter with me so I also shared the potato salad with her and ordered a yogurt with granola.  This was no ordinary McDonalds yogurt parfait - it was so delicious I had to have some too! One gripe (that could be easily fixed by the owner) - PLEASE BUY ONE HIGHCHAIR for your guests to use.  We would love to come back often (as we go see grandma/grandpa) but I cant take another lunch with her on my lap:)"
1,"Let me preface this review ..I have lived in this area for 15 years and Chompies has been the only option for good Jewish deli. In my 51 years I have never received worse service than from Chompies They ALWAYS get the order wrong., Tonight after much debate I caved for my daughter who has strep throat. She wanted nothing else but matzah ball soup to make her feel better. So reluctantly I called in for take out at Chompies. I assumed the one thing on there menu that might be a safe bet and hard to screw up would be the soup. I returned home and called my daughter in to tell her I got what the doctor ordered. As I watched her pour it in the bowl we noticed it was missing one key ingredient......... THE SOUP!!!!!  When I decided to call and tell Chompies this has to be the 10th or 12 time in a row they have screwed up our order. This was more than screwing up a order. This was forgetting the soup in SOUP. They told me if I wanted the broth I should have asked for it in a separate container. I responded I didnt think I had to ask for broth in soup! I WILL NEVER GIVE THEM A DIME OF MY MONEY AGAIN.  I highly recommend to drive the additional 15-20 minutes in your car and find somewhere else when looking for jewish comfort food. You will be highly disappointed with Chompies. This is the first time I have ever heard of yelp. My son told me to come on here because this is a way to tell other people to avoid restaurants such as these. I hope you take my advice."
2,"Oy ve iz mir! Not to be a kvetch....but I consider myself to be an expert on Jewish delis.  As a New Yorker from a predominantly Jewish area and married to a Jew, Ive had more than my fair share of experiences at them.  My husband and I woke up this morning with a burning desire for a good bagel, corned beef on rye, and a knish.  So I schlepped all the way up to the PV Mall to get it. Ok, first of all, the decor is terribly schlocky.  Its kind of like the tourist trap Jewish deli you find in Times Square.  Its like a Disney version of a NY deli.   I take my number and head over to the cold case to get some drinks....of course they didnt have regular lemon Snapple (and why should they?  Its not like every deli, pizza place, and convenience store in NY carries it....) but they did have Dr. Browns Cel-Ray which is always a welcome sight.  Another thing they had in the cold case which I found to be odd were jars of Nathans pickles.  Nathans, like the hot dog place.  I would imagine a Jewish deli would have Ba Tampte pickles....I didnt even know Nathans made pickles!  It was a little lame to be honest. Anyways, I go up to the counter where there doesnt seem to be anyone working.  There was no organization to it.  So I waited.  And waited.  In New York, the deli is a finely tuned machine designed to move people quickly.  Chompies? Eh, not so much.  When I finally did place my order, the guy who took it had a hard time punching it into the computer and asked me to repeat it several times.  Despite saying I wanted my bagel toasted several times I was given a cold, untoasted bagel.  I waited a little longer for my order to come up and went on my merry way.   Here is the breakdown of the food we ordered- Matzoh ball soup- Surprisingly good.  I have never had matzoh ball soup with carrots and celery...so much chazerei!  Just give me the matzoh ball! Although, I will admit, it was solid.  I wouldnt go all the way to Chompies for it because I know that I can make it better in my own kitchen.  Plain bagel ""toasted"" with cream cheese- Terrible.  The bottom of the bagel was entirely too thick and was very hard.  They didnt even cut it all the way through, probably because the crust is too thick!  Corned beef on rye- Meh.  The corned beef wasnt very good, it wasnt corned enough.  If they make their own they didnt use a piece of brisket that was fatty enough.  The rye (which was not marble rye...) was lackluster.   It couldnt handle the corned beef, became soggy, and eventually fell apart.  The pickle it came with was the grossest thing Ive ever seen.  And it was definitely a kosher dill, even though I asked for a half sour.  The potato salad was actually really good though. Knish- Terrible.  The knishes in my elementary school cafeteria were better than this.  First of all, the outer crust was way too flimsy.  It should have been much, much, thicker, especially considering the gargantuan size of the knish.  We essentially ate a large plate of mashed potatoes.  The potato inside itself was unremarkable.  Not only do I have this Jewish thing going on but Im also Irish....Ive never met a potato dish I didnt like.  Until today.  I didnt even finish my half of the knish.  Now for the prices.  Whats with this meshugas?  $2.29 for a bagel with cream cheese is a tad much.  In NY they run you about $1.35.  The corned beef sandwich was $12.50!  Now, Ive paid that much for sandwiches in NY before but you get 2 lbs of meat and several layers of sandwich!  This was not a $12.50 sandwich.  I was also going to get us some whitefish salad to sample but at $15.99/lbs it wasnt happening.   Why anyone should schlep all this way, in this heat, schvitzing all over, for this dreck?  I dont know!"
4,"Great place, great food, great environment ."
5,Excellent
4,This hole in the wall quite possible has the best Chinese food in Phoenix. Deffinitely the best Wor Won Ton soup and pork Egg Foo Young. Great for carry out and they have a large delivery area!
5,"Place is awsome.  Got the beef cheesesteak and everything was great.  The bread was possibly the best I have ever had.  Price was pretty good.  Just over 9 bucks for a whole sammich and soda.  While waiting I walked around and I plan on going back for some shopping.  Lots of pasta, sauces and just about anything you could want for Italian food.  5 stars all the way."
5,"Updating my review after several weeks. Appears maybe the managers read these reviews. In the last few weeks this store has improved 2 stars. The eggs in my BBs have been cooked perfectly, Diet Coke tastes better and they have not forgotten anything in all my visits. Added two stars because they have been consistently 5 stars since my last review...but I am still watching."
4,"I needed to grab a bite on a day in the office, so I thought Id take a little trek over to Sandwich Club. Lots of my former co-workers would tell me that they loved the food here. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by the owner. A super cool dude. He promptly asked if it was my first time there, and he asked where I was from. I like a little small talk before a sandwich. In any case, I ended up going with a no-mayo tuna salad sandwich. Do you remember that time in junior high when you saw a pretty girl and you never had the guts to go talk to her? But your friends dared you to do it? The no-mayo tuna salad is the pretty girl. I dare you to try it. Its amazing. The capers and lemon juice make this so flavorful. Youll be holding hands with this, and it will grace your lips in no time....unlike that girl from Jr. High who secretly despised you because you were fat. Oh wait. The menu seems quite diverse, with many sandwich options, and they also make crepes. The food tasted great, the service was great. Id definitely come back for more and try something else. Afterall....who doesnt love a good sandwich!"
5,"I walked here in the heat and was immediately greeted with an ice cold beer. For free! It was a delicious IPA and the staff couldnt have been friendlier. There were even snacks. I also had another sample of their Camelback ale. Both were heaping samples, almost a full cup. The tour was fun and informative. The co owner George even gave me and my boyfriend a ride to the lightrail stop!! We didnt bring our bikes. So awesome.  Definitely recommend. Lovely way to spend a Saturday afternoon."
4,"I have a cooking problem- I cant do it. However, I loved coming to Entrees to Go to make our meals. My husband bought a Groupon for this place and we decided to try it out. It was a wonderful experience, and that means a lot coming from me since I am not a fan of cooking.  I love the concept of Entrees to Go. You prepare your meal at this place and bring them home in a baggie.  Meals ready to cook and no mess in my kitchen = awesomeness! Everything you need to know to prepare your food is explained and if you have any questions they are answered immediately.  The only downfall...The price w/o a Groupon is a little pricey. Three full size entrees (each entree serving 4-6) is regularly $80. Its great if you work full-time and dont have time to cook on your own but its a little high for my pocketbook. However, if money wasnt a factor I would cook every meal at Entrees to Go.  Loved it!"
4,"I came to this place for my birthday celebration with my fiance and another couple. I was definitely in a good mood. THE FOOD First, the salad bar. I am not much of a veggie lover, but the selection here is impressive, especially in light of this being a place where you eat the cow, not the cows food. Besides a variety of veggies and dressings, you have a few cold cut meats, cheeses and smoked salmon to select from. From personal experience, tomatoes are good, all cheeses and meats are too. Salmon was simply delicious. For the main course, its all sorts of meat, mostly varieties of beef plus lamb and chicken. I liked all of them, but most of the beef was a salty to my taste (hence the loss of a star). Some of it can be explained by my getting the first cut off the meat several times, which meant that I got the salt seasoning in addition to the salt in the meat.  That aside, the meat is high quality and the main objective here is to remember not to get too much too soon, so you can enjoy everything the place has to offer. Sides were small (as they should be) and included polenta, mashed potatoes and fried bananas. All good. The wine selection is extensive and from our limited tasting, quite good. We had Cabernet and malbec. SETTING This is a rather large stand alone restaurant, but has surprisingly personal feeling, especially if you consider the amount of staff running around. It is not too brightly lit and has generally darker tones to the interior. There is also a cozy bar to the side of the main entrance that is a pleasant place to wait for others to arrive. SERVICE Attentive and not at all pushy. OVERALL I came here in a good mood and left in an even better mood and feeling like a python after eating a cow. Which was close enough to true amount of food in me. Highly recommend this both for the experience and the food itself."
2,"I went to NOCA about a month after is opened and was wowed. I told all my fellow foodies about my wonderful experience, the innovative menu and all the little extras that made the meal a really special dining experience in Phoenix.  I went back with friends twice after in the coming months and was pleased each time.  I just went back this past Saturday though, and would have to say I would no longer suggest it for a special night out. It was as if the magic was gone and that the place was showing its age and loosing its ""specialness"". It was really just ok. The chefs talent shows, but too many other let downs.  When we arrived for our 8:30 reservation the place was crowded. The host was friendly and told us that our table would be ready soon and it was. We sat down at our table and thats when things started turning out not as well as expected. Seated in a back corner--which I did not mind---I noticed the walls were filthy---scratched and beat up and dirty. That was my view, so of course its all I could focus on. The waiter did not show up for 5 min. to take our drink order, and when he did it took 20 min. to get them to us. He apologized, but at 8:45 on a Saturday night that waiting for a first drink is not fun.  When then settled down with our menus and picked our choices. It was then we were told that they were out of the veal --which of course 2 of us had chosen by then, and that there was only one Skate dish--which of course the other 2 of us had decided on. They were also out of 3 other items. I felt I was back in the old Eleve (located in this same spot)--the food was great there as well---when they did not run out of many items on the menu. They may be ok when you have a larger menu, but with a small menu to begin with this is a real disappointment.  Gone were the pop rocks that I thought was so fun as an intermezzo, instead a spoon of something that was not described was set down in front of us. A simple salad--good--was $15---and most starters are at least that much. Good, but not worth the price. Otherwise, entrees were good--not special, but tasty and served with good presentation. The cotton candy is still there--and still an attention getter. And I still love the desert selections---especially the malt that I had with mini doughnuts in with dipping sauces.  I think I am able to overlook the fact that its really not an attractive room--the energy from the kitchen and the close tables add noise and excitement to the room, but the art and lighting is ugly and now that its starting to look run down as well--there are too many new, beautiful places in the city with equally good food and equally as pricey that are not in strip mall. And they usually still have most menu selections on a Saturday night."
4,"Since this is a Kimpton Hotel my standards are fairly high.  The reception area and pool are very well done, in typical Kimpton fashion. The rooms are nice, however could use more work. The bathrooms are completely remodeled, but the little amenities that Im use to like the Ipod docking station, flat screen tv, cordless phone, room service past 11pm and multiple outlets (im an electronics junkie) just arent there. The room really feels like any other average hotel.  The spa was lovely, but it is not a full spa. I was hoping to sit in the steam room before my 90min massage, but unfortunately there wasnt one to sit in. The massage room was nice and the largest I had ever been in. It had its own private bath/changing room and a large copper tub close to the actual massage table. I was pretty bummed I didnt add a bath to my massage.  All in all I would stay here again since its in a great location. Plus, the guys at the bell desk will give you a ride (within 3 miles) in a Cadillac Escalade free of charge. That was a great when it came time to partying at night!"
4,"Well, i was very excited to go to this event, however, not so excited when it was all over. The music was great and it is a very nice place. It really reminds me of Vegas. However, it  was fashion week and we all thought that we would see models sashaying down the runway. But, no. No fashion at all. The wine was comp and it was very good ,i give great praise for that!  But the samples of food were few and far between. The Servers skipped out many times. Not like most Yelp events which are usually out the door GREAT!  We ordered from the happy hour menu.  I fully agree lots of salt, but i think it was the soy sauce, it was the most salty..i have ever had. There is very little parking here as well so be prepared for that as well.  All in all we had a good time.But, not as fabulous as most Yelp events."
5,"Totally worth the drive from Scottsdale. The food is delicious, and is not pre-packaged, such a nice change for a coffee joint. Support local business, Starbucks has nothing on Lux; other than a million locations."
2,"I judge a soul food place by its fried chicken, a donut shop by its old fashioned, an ice cream place by its vanilla, and a Greek place by its gyros.  The gyros here are bland and wholly unspectacular - and sourced from the same frozen food purveyor (Sysco?) as every other gyro stop in Phoenix.  The cloyingly thick pita didnt help either. I dont know why it is so challenging to find a legitimate rotating spit gyro in this town - but it is.  Especially near downtown Phoenix. Recommendations welcome."
1,"OVERPRICED & DECEITFUL & RUDE! I should have read the reviews before I came here! I took a bridesmaid dress in to have the top taken in like 1/4 inch, not much. I asked her, how much will this cost? She assured me it would not be ""much"". It was $60 and she hardly did a thing, cant even steam it there. I was irate but calmly asked her if she could charge less and she screamed NO! She said its because the dress cost more. Yeah...like that matters A guy was there dropping off pants that needed taken OUT which is a lot more work, she charge him $18.50 for each pair. I dont know if that is good for pants a lot but her pricing scale seems way off! Previously Ive been to 5th Avenue Alterations and they charge me $50 for a floor length brdiesmaid dress that they took in the whole thing AND steamed it. Theyre also polite and will work with you on pricing and communicate with you beforehand. Definitely worth the few extra minutes of a drive!!"
5,"SAKE    *Japanese alcoholic beverage made from fermented rice; usually served hot . ( Full disclosure : I dont like sake) Parents in Scottsdale for a first look at the new house / neighborhood. We were on the horns of a dilemma : ? Would a mid week , early season dinner at the club be too quiet? Should we  descend south of  the Frank Loyd Wright  into south - north Scottsdale....?? We opted for the safe bet - booked a car and headed south to the Ocean Club. ** A) never drink and drive in Scottsdale ( or anywhere else for that matter) **B) if youre a foreigner - never- ever drink and drive in Scottsdale **C) A + B refer to you Nikolai Khabibulin  (( A nod of support to the YELP community . After perusing the Ocean Club reviews retrospectively I believe the correlation existing between the posted notes and reality to be around 0.90 Well Done!! ( I would go as high as a correlation of 0.95 if high and low marks were thrown out ( similar to olympic skating or gymnastics))) We arrived at the club---- a good bar crowd ( not quite as Mountain lioness(y) as i had expected (? hoped?) -- ? mid week perhaps...?, a good blend of hipsters , hobos and Mrs Lovey Howell IIIs  ( score +1 for the Ocean Club) We were promptly seated - at a good table - well positioned , near the back and partially curtained - nice. ( score + 1 for the Ocean Club) The waiter then promptly arrived to take our drink orders: Now - I dont like Sake ( see note above) - but on occasion - I like to fancy myself as the kind of guy who may indeed like Sake- hence , I order a Grey Goose Sake Martini - "" I have no Sake"" the waiter announces sadly. Now - this is tricky - can I in good conscience penalize the establishment for not having a beverage that I really dont like or want in the first place? Too bad for you Ocean Club cause yes I can. ( score -1 for the Ocean Club) The drinks arrive - I have opted for Grey Goose sans Sake and yes -sweet Jesus  they are huge ( see prior posts). ( score + 1 for the Ocean Club) The waiter then arrives to review the menu and describe the specials- This he does without note , blackboard , evening card or inked cheat note on his wrist- He recites for what seems to be forever... It is like a reading from the old testament - but instead of a mere chapter of the book of Leviticus - he recites the entire book.... I am captivated ....( or is it the Grey Goose) ?? does he really know the name of the Italian girl who dug this evenings truffles up in Piedmont...?? ?? does he really know the glove size of the Japanese ranch worker who massaged the Wagyu beef and from which prefecture he hailed...?? ( if so - why didnt he have him send me some Sake....??) at any rate - I am entertained ( score + 1 for the Ocean Club) The food arrives - the portions are huge and the flavors sublime.

4,"My hubby and I have been fans of Roys since our first time at the flagship location on Oahu . . . and weve watched him expand to the mainland. Our experience with the mainland Roys have been hit and miss, but the Marriott Desert Ridge location pretty much knocks it out of the park! We went at the tail end of Arizona Restaurant Week. We really liked the menu options for this special week, and the warm chocolate souffle cake is always out of this world . . . If that was the only thing that tasted good, then we would feel we got our moneys worth . . . but we didnt have to worry about it because everything was perfect from beginning to end. We had an adorable server who had a great personality and excellent people skills. She was unassuming and let us linger between courses. As I am a stickler about food coming out too soon after just finishing one course, this was just perfect! And so relaxing. The ambiance on the patio, which is where we chose to sit, almost felt as if we were on one of the islands, not in the middle of the desert . . . with the tiki torches lit and the sound of the babbling water features throughout the resort, it came pretty close . . . it was just missing the trade winds.  The resort had a band playing as well . . . they were pretty good, a few ups and downs. I would have loved if the music was a little more subtle than the pop-jazz mix they were playing . . . oh, but I have digressed.  My hubby and his daughter chose the restaurant week menu. Hubby had the Grilled Szechuan Spiced Pork Ribs Smoked & Glazed in Roys Original Mongolian Sauce. A bit cliche, but they were finger lickin good! My step-daughter and I shared the Crispy Spicy Ahi Sushi Roll with Ginger Wasabi Beurre Blanc -- it was huge and almost a meal. The rolls were fresh, crunchy, and had a little kick . . . not too spicy. It was a good thing I agreed to help her with it! For entrees, my hubby had the Roys Original Hawaiian Blackened Island Ahi with Spicy Soy Mustard Butter Sauce. It, too, was an ample portion of tender ahi that was complimented by the sauce but no overpowered by it. My step-daughter had the Roys Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi with Maine Lobster Essence. Another nice portion of perfectly cooked Mahi.  We all were starting to feel the aloha spirit . . . I had to be the exception by ordering off the regular menu and chose my most favorite entree of all . . . the Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish . . . Aah, what a delight, so melt-in-your-mouth delicate . . . I was in island heaven. Desserts were total home runs -- the melting hot chocolate souffle is mandatory for any chocolate lover. In fact, it tastes the same at every Roys weve been to . . . it never disappoints. A total surprise . . . and a delightful one . . . was the chocolate coconut cheesecake which came with a side of mango sorbet . . . or did she say it was pineapple sorbet . . . whatever . . . it was the perfect accompaniment to the light and fluffy cheesecake. We also ordered a bottle of Newton claret which was a modestly priced wine and as my husband said as he swirled and sipped it . . . ""I know my wines . . . "" Having to always be the exception, I ordered the he Original Hawaiian Martini, which was what I considered my dessert. It was a juicy combination of Maui pineapple, vodka and coconut rumMMMMM! It was truly a beautiful evening from start to finish. You may be asking why I didnt give it five stars then if there were no misfires . . . that five star is reserved for Roys Hawaiian restaurants that really do create the aloha experience with some special touches only that can only be enjoyed there!"
4,Just happened to be in the neighborhood when we saw this BBQ place.  The pulled pork and beef did not disappoint.  The sandwiches can be called hardy portions on large buns.  The sauce was excellent.  The place is very clean.  Very good service.  Was not impressed with the coleslaw - seemed flat.  Will return as the high ratings of this establishment are well deserved.
5,"Hands down, best slices in Scottsdale...."
2,"Ive been here twice...the first time was driven by a rumor that they made their own root beer.  Im a sucker for homemade root beer, so I had high hopes that this place would become a favorite.  My husband and I were so excited when these huge glasses of RB hit the table!!  And then confusion...both of us looked at each other and said ""WTF???""  Worst RB EVER! What the heck was in this drink that made it taste like ass?  We looked all over the menu and found nothing.  Then we saw the ""fine print"" on a small table sign...STEVIA.  Its made with Stevia NOT sugar...Im sorry, but I have to say that this is the lame-est root beer on the planet.  If Im going to treat myself to a big glass of homemade root beer, I want it to be delectable...sugar and all...no freaking high fructose corn syrup and no bloody artificial sugars (and yes, I know stevia is ""natural"" but who gives a crap...it tastes terrible anyway). After the root beer debacle, it didnt get better.  The food was meh...service was not so great (there were moments of ""is she ever coming back???"").  Id say, go here for the beer, sans root, but thats about it.  Otherwise, skip this place and drive out to Four Peaks...youll be happier all around."
2,"The actual restaurant is fine, the service is friendly and good. I am not going to go in to the food other than to say, no. Oh well $340 bucks and all I can muster is a no."
5,I love this store!  They have an amazing staff and the most modern clothes!  I set my appointments with a few of the employees and I always get compliments on my outfits when I go out!!  Hats off to the Ted Baker team in Scottsdale Fashion Square!
5,"I love this PHO and spring rolls, and for the friendly and fast service plus its cheap! Oh its truly a must try place."
4,love the gyro plate. Rice is so good and I also dig their candy selection :)
4,"went for lunch today with my girlfriend.  i had the chicken tacos and she had the mahi tacos.  you get three little tacos per order.  we switched one for one.  the chicken was freakin great.  i had a small chicken bone and some cartilidge in mine and i still loved it.  seasoned well and dressed well with an adobo sauce, maybe.  it had some green cabbage, some sliced fresno peppers and what i think was manchego.    i loved it.  the girl had fried mahi tacos  (they offered the option of grilled rather than fried).  it was good, had some remoulade and the same cabbage and fresnos on it.  it was all good.  the service, the food, the atmosphere, and the whole package.  go here, eat here.  be happy.  quality over quantity. always.  well done mission staff, well done"
4,"Good food in a unique setting with fantastic service.  Nobou at Teeter House offers up a very pleasurable dining experience. Ill start with the great.  The restaurant is in a more than 100-year-old house in the heart of downtown Phoenix.  There is nearly a perfect feeling that I have been invited inside someones home for a fancy dinner party.  The staff was fantastic.  Our server, Alexis, was very attentive, friendly, fast, and really knew the menu (or at least was good at selling every dish with a very thorough description about the technique and flavors used to create it).  The presentation of the food is creative and beautiful.  The not-so-great.  The food is served in small portions at a high price.  I wouldnt have a big problem with that, I actually think Americans should be more into tapas eating, except nothing we ordered blew my mind or taste buds away.  Dont get me wrong; everything we ordered was excellent.  The food is perfectly cooked, seasoned, sauced, and artistically plated.  It just didnt have that over-the-top ""WOW"" factor I was hoping for. Having said that.  Nobuo at Teeter House is still a place that everyone should try out at least once.  Its an enjoyable place to eat.  Its probably a fun place to go with a small group of friends just to hang out, order a lot of plates and just sample what the restaurant has to offer. As I said, the price can be a little high.  It took five plates and a dessert to create a fair size meal for just two people.  That came to nearly a $100 tab (with drinks).  But Nobuo at Teeter House is on Local Dines (http://www.localdines.com/?ref=19485) with a $50 or $25 gift certificate.  Take advantage of the deal and cross Nobuo off your Phoenix restaurant bucket list."
5,"I love guerreros!  I worked in Mesa 15 years ago and we did burrito runs here all the time. Im a huera, but my Hispanic pals all rated this place authentic.  Its a husband and wife team that runs it.  The best thing are the beans - incidentally, thats how I rate the authenticity of Mexican fare- They are the kind of beans I ate in Nogales during college (at a place I could only locate while intoxicated).  Thinner, lighter colored, and delicious compared to any Ive EVER had this side of the border.  I live in PV now- super far - but after this I think Im gonna have to take a road trip tomorrow to Mesa! Yum!"
4,"I dig the Vig. Good food and a great atmosphere/patio. If you like Bocce Ball, then you should definitely check it out, but go soon before it starts to warm up again and be sure to take the Vig Rig home if youre blasted."
1,"A couple Saturdays ago, went with my mom to get my name added to her accounts should the unthinkable happen. We first went to Chase which took all of ten minutes. The personal banker was great - in-out-done.  Then we headed to her Credit Union at approximately 10:00 AM. They were quite busy, apparently. When we checked in, I heard grumbling from other customers and asked the wait time.  I was told there were two people ahead of us in line and it ""shouldnt be long."" 30 minutes later, my mom went to ask how much longer it would take. Jennfer, who was manning the reception desk, dismissed her rudely in front of a lobby of customers. My mom is as sweet as tea in Tennesee, so to hear her called out in front of a lobby of people as a disruption was upsetting.  45 minutes later, I went up to ask if it would be much longer. Jennifer said curtly, ""Were busy."" Apparently, on Saturdays, theyre busy and one should avoid transacting business there on the weekend. I dont recall being spoken to so rudely at even a fast food restaurant in recent years... Another ten minutes or so went by (as did my deadline to make another appointment I had made), I was told it would be ""two more minutes"", as I had to go through their background check to be a member. They were having a difficult time with my Washington Driver License and the weird characters it has (an asterisk in part of the number). After all was said and done, over an hour later, I was approved to be a member and was successfully put as a signer on my moms account. I asked for Jennifers card, as I told her I was not happy with the way she had spoken to me or my mother, and I intended to speak with her manager.  To that I received a reply she did not have one. The woman sitting next to her informed me she was the assistant manager and that they were busy on Saturdays. My biggest beef was this: If it was going to be an hour to speak with someone, tell me. I can make other arrangements or come in during the week. Being told first, ""It shouldnt be long,"" and then, ""Were busy"" is not an excuse. If the business is so overwhelming on Saturdays, perhaps it would be wise to staff more people, extend the hours, or inform people of the wait theyre likely to experience because of the queue. Or dont open on Saturdays! As a 20 year veteran of the service industry, I am very disappointed at the level of service Arizona Federal Credit Union provided my mom and me, but also all the other people I watched be dismissed like the Credit Union was doing them a favor. After doing some searching for a new home for moms money, she can get a much better rate at a (four letter word forthcoming) BANK! Im normally a big fan of member-owned institutions, but based on the incredibly rude serviced I received from Arizona Federal Credit Union, Id say go to a Credit Union or Bank where the employees actually read the mission statement that is painted on the wall behind them."
4,confirmed better than subway blimpie quiznos etc etc Not really much else to say that hasnt been said above. Wished they had more vegetarian options :(
5,"Service is good... The newer waitors tend to forget youre there. Food is delicious, never gotten food poisoning... Cheesecake is magnificent... The best kind is the Godiva, expensive bit worth it!"
2,"Played today, course in decent shape for the money.  Would be nice if they would educate groundskeepers on not running mower up to you when trying to play.  Also would be nice if beverage service would continue after 4 oclock.  Course was packed play was slow and no beverage service.  Called in but pro shop phones shut off at 4 30 .  No ranger on course either to keep groups moving ended up not finishing eighteen,teed off at 12 30."
5,"I really adore this place. Theyve got some of the best lentil soup around and all of their chicken dishes have been perfectly seasoned and very, very juicy. I recently got the kabob plate and it came out so tender and juicy it was falling apart on my fork. Their hummus and garlic sauce are both very good as well and the service is quick and friendly.  Last time I was in, I noticed they expanded their dining section so the place is a bit bigger now, probably to accommodate the increase in customers from the park-and-ride light rail station right in front of their restaurant. Do yourself the favor. If youre heading on the light rail and feel hunger strike, stop off here and enjoy a nice meal. They have good lunch specials around $7.50 for a full plate with meat, hummus, garlic sauce, pita, and tabouli. Mmmm!"
2,"For some reason, these people seem to think its OK to price a tank top, that probably has less thread count than my thong and cost about 17cents of labor to make, at $50.  They also seem to think that dressing up their mannequins like paraplegic color and pattern blind grandmas gives them business. Oh wait...it does! Because this is Tempe. And Tempe, as I cant over-repeat, is the devil."
5,"Cheese Curds!   They have been so hard to find in AZ.    Like the Jalepeno ones too. Really good fresh milk.   Worth the stop. Bring cash, not credit or debit cards"
4,"Tried this place for weekday lunch.  We arrived before noon and good thing since they have a big lunch crowd.  (not to worry, plenty of parking in back and seating outside w/ misters)  Kudos to Aric and Monica for stopping by our table several times to make sure service was great or they fixed it.  We started with the Bruchetta, which was piled high.  The we had the Smokey (arugula & smoked prosciutto) and the Marg pizzas. Almost had the Pabst on tap, but went for the Dunkel since its harder to find.  As if the food wasnt enough, the decor and ambiance was over the top.  The herb garden as you walk in and the bar with the salon chairs was a nice touch.  Cant wait to go back."
1,Like watching a train wreck in slow motion will definitely be going somewhere else for bagels from now on disappointing have been going there for years.  The eight day old cream cheese was a nice touch (yuck!)
3,"This club has great bands.  I saw 68 Guns and Metal Elvis here.  Also at the Metal Elvis show was a Van Halen tribute band called VH Too.  The music is top notch and it is usually not too crowded so you can go right up to the stage.  However, there are only a few tables, which is annoying if you need a place to put your drink or coat or something.  I also wish the ceilings were a bit higher.  Would be better if they could combine an indoor/outdoor area with the stage.  Overall the building seems cramped, small and old.  The prices are reasonable though.  The location is kind of strange however.  We took a cab there but when we wanted to leave we couldnt get one to come pick us up despite the staff saying they called one.  Finally we walked to a gas station and called from there.  This reminds me too much of Club Red.  Great bands, crappy club.  I hope that someone opens a brand new club for bands of this caliber.  Or else I will need to open one myself."
5,I love the menu here it has many selections of many cultures including Italian!!!
4,"We stopped in here on a hot summer afternoon, grumpy because we had been on a wild goose chase for mint. Couldnt find it anywhere, like Frys, Bashas, or TJs, even in those teeny tiny overpriced little packages. They have it here in big bunches for something ridiculous like 59 cents. Since we had friends coming over for mojitos, this made me happy! Its just about mojito season again, so Ill be headed back to this location. The produce section was large and had some good-looking stuff in it. The location isnt really too scary."
4,"Some buddies and I went to Scottsdale for a golfing boondoggle last week and a couple of guys in the know directed us to The Mission. DANG! We let our server, Jonathan, drive the car so to speak.  He quizzed us on our likes and dislikes and brought us our orders (we didnt specifically order).  We had 7 people in our group and every plate was spot on.   We started with the chicken (thigh) tostadas and the crispy cola pork belly tostadas.  They were great; particularly the pork belly ones.  MAN were those good.  My dinner was the Chorizo Porchetta which brought a big hunk of slow cooked pork that shredded beautifully.  Along side this hunka hunka porky love was a salt block carrying 10 small corn tortillas to build little tacos from.  Some tasty accompaniments: sauce, onion, & cilantro, finished the presentation.  It was a fantastic dish.  The other 6 dishes were just as great.  To note: the honey chipotle grits that my buddy got were super tasty.  Especially when you dumped some of their ghost chili sauce (forget what it was called).  Desert was the Pumpkin bread pudding (YUM!) and fried bananas.   All in all, a fantastic place.  Really good."
4,"The Good:  Really good burger. Good fries. The Bad: Terrible paint and lighting. Cant even hang out for long. (Maybe that is the idea.) Dont like high booth stalls much. JMHO of course. Also a note to the sewage smell that others noted. That little area on that side of the mall has smelled like hell for years for some odd reason. It sucks for the businesses, but I assure you it has nothing to do with Smashburger alone nor should it cause any health concerns. Just luck of the draw on a bad sewer vent problem. Update: 4/18/10 Went again. Really very good. Decor is still not my fav but the food is solid. Like I said, it is the juiciest burger I have had in a while. Shoestring fries are kill. Upped from 3 stars to four."
3,"I finally tried Spicy Pickle last week. I like the name and was intrigued about their menu. Paninis, soups, salads, pizzetas, nothing out of the ordinary. I had a half sandwich ( Sausalito Bandido?), half salad combo ( Spinach salad). Food was fresh and good. The sandwich could have stand a little more meat, it was truly flat. The salad was crisp and dressing was on the side, which I appreciated.   On my way out I got a chocolate chip cookie that was OK. I love cookies and they have to be pretty bad for me not to like them. This one, I kid you not, must have had maybe 3-4 chocolate chips? So if youre craving chocolate, this is not the cookie for you."
5,"Such strange combinations of flavors, yet they taste so good.  Weve been here three or four times and are never disappointed."
4,"Delux makes good burgers, but you probably figured that out already. They also have good fries (sweet and regular potato thank you very much). They are kinda expensive. If I have to compare it to something I would compare it to California Pizza Kitchen. Better than a regular Pizza, but probably not worth the cost."
1,"There are few resources in Arizona for dancers, actors and performers, so its best to order online if you have the time to wait for shipping. Dees Dancewear is overpriced and because they know they are the only game in town, their customer service (and return policies) have suffered. In an emergency situation, youre better suited going to Mischas Dancewear on 33rd Ave and Bell or Capezios in Scottsdale. Otherwise, order online and steer clear of this establishment when possible."
4,"This place is awesome!  Where else can you hear incredible live jazz music for free on a Monday night with reasonably priced drinks?  Any other major city (like, say, New York), the cover would be at least $15, and they would make you pay for the second set, as well, and a place to sit or stand with a decent view of the musicians would be hard to come by, and by the end of the night you would end up feeling ripped off.   Granted, this place can get crowded on the weekends, but no wonder.  The beer (no draft) and wine selection is good, the vibe is laid-back, and the music Ive heard has been great (Ive only see one group here--Jiggle--and they play jazz.) Tip for music-lovers:  Sit or stand in the room where the music is.  Sitting any farther back and you may be tempted to take a swing at the people who just come to chat and fail to understand what makes the Lost Leaf so unique.  But do give them a bit of a break.  They are, after all, probably ""paying"" for your cover charge with all their imbibing of alcohol."
4,"Well, Ive been to Liberty Market several times now and its time to add my two cents. Yes, I know, there are already 250+ Reviews, what more could I add? Dont worry, Ill stick to the facts; consider this the cliff-notes version. Take the first parking spot you can find or drive the the lot west of the building. Walk in, grab a menu, and get in line.  With all of the goodness on the menu, try to make your decision before you get to the register.   A few of my favorites 1. CORTADITO - coffee drinkers, do NOT miss this one!  Cuban miro-latte, on the sweeter side, served in a pair of espresso shots or a bowl, perfection! 2. Rancher Salad - steak, caramelized onions, blue cheese, arugula, do I have to keep going? 3. Sweet Potato Salad - a unique salad, SO much better than your average potato salad 4. Cinnamon Rolls the size of a human face, if youre into to that kind of thing, share with a friend, or four. there are more, but I promised to keep it short. Back to the line. As youre making up your mind, be ready to answer the number of people in your party so they can set you up with a table.  Try to resist the incredible looking, super-sized pastries and desserts in the case, or not, what the heck, just get it!.  Pay the friendly cashier, proceed to the fountain drink station to fill your glasses, and maneuver the maze of tables to find the one with your number. Just a few tips.  One, it can get a little noisy in there, so may not be the best place if youre planning a discussion over your meal. Two, LM gets busy and the staff is always trying to find a table for the guests in line by the time they finish at the register.  So, while the dining room attendants are friendly and attentive, they are definitely trying to turn the table as soon as youll let them. And now you know what to expect.  If you dont like lines or loud places, this might not be your favorite place. Overall, delicious, fresh food and shinny, happy people to bring it to you.  Lets just say LM is enough to get me out of my five mile Ahwatukee radius, and that is hard to do! Now you know the scoop . . . Im out!  Enjoy!"
1,"The cheesy breadsticks were delicious.  Everything else, not so much."
5,very wonderful and romantic place to take your loved one :)
4,"Oooooh, I liked it, very much so!  Just sad that I didnt get to try more of its myriad offerings, especially the pizza.  We enjoyed a lovely brunch here on a Friday.  Cute little place, lots of ambiance, good people watching (quite the hopping place on this midsummer day), tasty food.  We had a round of Bloody Marys, and those were nicely done, as well.  A great spot to just hang and nosh and chitchat with friends."
4,"One of the best sports bars in the valley. Tons of screens (although some of the big screen projectors could be updated). Nice big drafts and the food is always tasty. Try the teriyaki chicken sandwich with fries its awesome. Upstairs they have shuffleboard and pool tables. Golden tee 2009 downstairs with another pool table. If you like loud sports bars where the patrons get into the game this is the spot to go. Plenty of fun to be had. People say too many kids but I guess I go later on at night and never have seen a problem with little kids.?. The service is on and off here, sometimes its been great sometimes its been useless."
4,"Could use a remodeling job, but the food is really good for the area.  The wait staff is very attentive, and the free chips and hot sauce for dipping, are REALLY GOOD.  The fajitas are my usual.  Worth the visit and youll leave satisfied."
5,"Very friendly staff, or a fast food place-- their customer service and friendliness is unmatched.. I go more often than not simply because of the experience every time! Thanks Micky!"
5,"I cant believe this wasnt reviewed yet!  This place rocks, and Dr. Heather is the very best vet in town. Shes reasonable in price, thorough in her evaluations, and super kind. She handled the life and death issues so carefully and warmly, and she talks about her own pets and has compassion!  When our cat Everett died, she not only called us throughout the whole cremation process, but she sent a card and when we picked up the ashes - she had made a single footprint ""ornament"" with a ribbon and his name on it as a gift.  Never had a vet do anything so kind.   We have had MANY cats and MANY VETS.  I know a good vet. Go here. Please go here!"
5,"I can always count on Sacks.   It is always fresh and always tasty and the sandwiches are so creative that years later Im still not sure how they get those fabulous blends and tastes that they do.   I try to hit lunch a little off the lunch hour and then the crowds are not so bad and I can find parking but, its worth it to eat a little latter when I know the meal will be so satisfying I can go back to work and be so productive.   Sacks is my ""go to place"" when I have a guest or friend that I want to be well fed and satisfied too."
3,"Food is great, but service is horrible.  The servers are rude and it took a 30 minutes to get our drinks and another 30 for our food. I really liked this place when it first opened.  We live in the area and had hoped for this to be a regular place for us to come to eat, drink and meet friends. I hope the management fixes the problem with the service.  If you are going to try this place, I suggest you sit at the bar for better service."
2,"dragged my husband here because the menu online lists a particular kind of spring roll that i love. and when we show up, the menu was TOTALLY different.  this place is geared toward your typical Arizona-white crowd. its pretty watered down Viet food, and was sorely disappointing. and expensive. boo. go across the street to Mekong if you prefer better tasting, more authentic Viet food."
5,"I have been shopping at Lee Lees for over ten years.  The store stocks Chinese, Malaysian, Korean, Japanese, West Indian and other foods.  You can usually find what you are looking for here.   The fish selection is vast, fresh and reasonably priced.   They have the finest selection of noodles and yerba mate tea!!! Enjoy"
3,"Ive gotten lunch take out here a few times. The only thing Ive tried is the drunken noodles. While I think they are pretty decent, I have been having serious issues getting the right spicy-nes. The first time I got them, I asked for level 3 spicy. Their spice meter goes from 0-5. I love love hot and spicy Thai food, however these noodles were practically inedible. Yet, they were so delicious at the same time I devoured the entire thing. And I felt like I was going to die later, as my stomach felt like a fishnet stocking... The second time I ordered them I asked for level 2 spicy. This time they were not spicy at all. At all!! They were so bland. I mean, they still tasted good, but were missing that drunken noodle kick! So, at this point I dont know what to do. Obviously every cook there must have a different idea of what each number means.  The last time I ordered from here, I simply said drunken noodles. I didnt specify a spicy level. I figured maybe this would give me the perfect in between spicy that I so desired! Well, when I got them, they were more bland than the level 2. And tasted kinda weird.  I will give them another try as they are right across the street from my work, and I hope we can work out our spicy issues!  4 stars for the service, theyre really friendly here 2 stars for the food, until we can work out our issues And 4 stars for the convenience!"
4,"When Im looking for the more mature, laid back version of Lux, I come to Copper Star. Coffee is not as good but service is great and place is inviting. Great neighborhood favorite."
4,"This place is very off-the-beaten-track, Im sure most people overlook it....I only came across it whilst searching online for somewhere different to eat...and when I came across the review on the Phoenix New Times website(http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2005-02-10/dining/sultans-of-shish/), I knew this was it... I only docked a star for the (extremely) sparse decor and atmosphere...this place could have been any other type of business with just a change of sign and omission of tables... anyway, the food was great! my fiance ordered skewers of beef and lamb(Im not too keen on lamb, but the beef was tender and succulent...very well spiced!)...I had a cucumber salad(diced, along with onions and parsley, and soaked in vinegar-lemon juice), which enchanted me so much that I created my own version at home and make it every time I feel like doing a bit of dicing(msg me for the recipe--its a bit death-breathy and labor-intensive but delicious!)... and, during dessert, I could see why Samarkand was voted Best Tea in Phoenix...the black tea was easily the best Ive ever had(besides a special brand of blue ginger tea I make a point to keep my cabinet stocked with)...it was strong and rich...absolutely incredible! definitely make it a point to search this place out--its worth the effort!"
4,"I cant believe Ive never reviewed this place before. Ive been here countless times before, and watched the place get upgraded and remodeled several years ago. I cant remember the first time I came here, but it was some time ago after I moved out here. The convention center has an older part thats smaller, and a new addition thats huge!  Plenty of events are held here all year round, from sporting events like the NBA all star game, to the auto show, they had an NRA convention a couple years ago with a zillion people, along with other regular yearly events like the auto show and several others. The place is large, and has 3 levels (a basement area, main level and upper level) with a crosswalk to get to the other side which is pretty darn cool. Its huge, spacious, and modern looking with its updates.  Escalators, stairs, etc.  The place is sparsely decorated with Arizona stuff that makes it really cool looking. They also have a cool light feature outside that illuminates the walkway with different colors at night and is really pretty to look at as well. The cool thing about it is too is that its easily accessible via light rail, and you dont have to spend $$ on parking...and let me tell you, the parking here isnt cheap! $12 for the garage, $10 in lots around, and its not any cheaper the farther away you get.  I dont know why anyone would want to park down here, since the light rail is $3.50 round trip, so save yourself a few bucks and take the rail. Youll thank me later! Theres also food and dining in here as well, with a variety of different style resturants, but again, its outrageously expensive!  They have a starbucks here too, which is their regular prices, but is like an extra $5 a person to eat here, so dine elsewhere before you come in here.  (minus the coffee since Starbucks is the only reasonably priced place in here.)  Plus, the convention center is a hop, skip and a jump from about a zillion other cool dining places that your better off eating at anyways, so do that instead. Aside from that, this place is pretty huge, and its worth checking out. Plenty of clean pretty bathrooms and tons to do in and outside of the center with variety of different sized spaces to hold any kind of event, large or small."
1,"Glad this place has new ownership... I should probably remove the review below, Its really harsh and doesnt apply to the NEW establishment.  You have been warned ;)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Short Review: THIS PLACE SUCKS BALLS Long Review: We were supposed to meet a friend here at Draft House on Saturday night. We were excited to be out on a date-like experience cuz its been a while. We went to my in-laws for dinner and then headed to Draft... I knew it was going to be interesting from the sound of the music as we pulled into the strip mall.  The music: Good music, probably the only good thing about this place - if youre a hip-hop fan. All hip-hop, all night.  The crowd: Ghetto fab all the way! Seems like everyone there is late 20s - early 30s (and some older sprinkled throughout the crowd) and none realize its not 1996 anymore. Expect to hear a lot of fake accents a la Da Bronx and a lot of misuse of slang terms. It was entertaining until it became annoying. Oh and people WILL steal your seats or tell you they are saved - ugh! The atmosphere: small, crowded...  Small dance floor.  A couple pool tables, but dont expect to get one. Some TVs playing various sports, which I guess qualifies this place as a ""sports cafe""??  The service: OMG, we had one beer each and the ""line"" was retarded, over 30 minutes to tab out. No line in sight, just people crowding together, trying to get to the front of the line.  Oh! and LOL.. the bar tenders are total morons, one of them complained to the guy next to us about his crappy tip and the other argued with his customer about whether they ordered rum and cokes or redbull and vodka.  The guy had already made the rum and cokes and was pissed that HE got it wrong.  Weirdos! If any of this appeals to you this is your place!  BTW her friend didnt show and we ended up going to Skip n Jans to play some pool :o)  We had a great time there :o)"
2,"Strange just strange. I park here when I travel out of town. I used the valet parking once last year and dont remember any issues. Today was my second time... I dropped my car off last week. The airport shuttle was waiting for me at baggage claim when my flight landed at midnight. I went to pick up my car after a long flight as was told ""its at the front"", the valet guy pointed and disappeared. I was left standing alone wondering if there was another side of the hotel where my car was?? I walked into the lobby and the receptionist was quick to tell me there is a balance on my account. Huh?? Number one I dont have an account at the hotel and number two I didnt stay here overnight. Again Im standing there thinking what is going on, is he getting my mixed up with someone else? Finally he explained the parking wasnt prepaid and I needed to pay in a order to get my car. He gave me a bit of an attitude as if I was refusing to pay. Dude, its 12:30am, I just got off a long flight & didnt realize my fiancé didnt prepay online when he set the whole thing up for me online. All this confusion could have been spared if the valet guy would have just said ""you pay at the desk"" instead of ""its at the front"" which is unclear and indirect. I think next time I go out of town ill try a different parking garage."
3,"Tried Rock Bottom tonight before a movie and I thought it was ok. I had the Lemon Grilled Chicken with Mashed Potatoes and Asparagus.  Everything was very yumm, but Rock Bottom just didnt make enough of an impression on me. If I was obsessed with beer maybe it would have gone over better. Restaurant ambiance and menu were very typical and neither were impressive. However my crazy friend Megan ordered Buffalo Fajitas, yes real buffalo steak, so that was a cool menu option.  Now I can add Buffalo to the list of crazy things Ann Marie has eaten. p.s Buffalo tastes a lot like steak."
5,"Stephen G. hit the nail on the head - ""You buy a peaceful experience"". I was looking for a resort/spa but also wanted to take advantage of horseback riding as much as I could. This resort definitely exceeded my expectations - the staff is AMAZING (friendly, accommodating, etc), the food was delicious, the resort is beautiful and the rooms were also clean and well-maintained. Everyone I encountered went the extra mile with regard to service. I came back to NYC completely rejuvenated."
4,This place is great. The Pizzas are single serving or post salad and some of the best Pizza Ive ever had. Salads are good and and service is excellent.  Keep it Simple Stupid KISS
3,"The food is as good as the Coronado location but the ambiance is seriously lacking. The inside had a funky smell so we opted for 100 degree heat and ate outside instead. The main reason for three instead of four stars is that they screwed up our order. Not a huge offense, you say? Well they put their uber spicy jalepenos on my toddlers quesadilla instead of on my burrito. They replaced it but still...  Bottom line: their food is good- love the carne and pork. Well eat here again but Ill be double checking to make sure the order is right."
4,So happy Los Dos Molinos is in the east valley! Los Dos makes it spicy so come prepared to drink a lot of margaritas...not like thats a bad thing. Great food & great prices!
4,"I went here with my mom while my dad had a dinner meeting. The atmosphere is hip but its also got a mature setting. It is a really great place for young adults and even older ones. The price was good, the food was amazing! The portions were also big and MOST the staff was friendly. I overheard two rude staff members making fun of the customers. However they might not even work there anymore. Great place!"
4,"Everything is awesome at this place, and authentic according to my Japanese friend. I just love the fact that they have more than just sushi. Their fish with rice dish was amazing. Since Ive come to AZ, Ive never seen this dish at any Japanese restaurants around here. The staff is all Japanese, with somewhat limited English, so I guess you know youre at an authentic place."
4,Zipps is a rocking place with TV screens in all viewable angles. The atmosphere is great and this place really packs it in on game nights like Monday Night Football. Smoking is outside because this place is around the Tempe border. The service is great and the food is even better. Try the chicken tacos! Good times had by all! Check it out some time!
5,"Alas...Ive given up the idea of writing a review for a place if it isnt at least 4 stars. Sue me; Im in the industry.  Fuego Bistro is by far one of the best places Ive been to recently. I was introduced to it this last weekend on a date. Ironically, its super close to my house yet Ive never heard of it. When we were arriving, I was a little curious to see where the hell he was taking me since there arent any signs really and its pretty hidden. Once we were inside, though, it was like finding a little treasure. The patio is welcoming & even though we didnt have a reservation (aka we couldnt sit outside) we snagged a table close enough to enjoy the beautiful weather.  We started off with a round of mojitos and even though its been a few years since theyve won best mojito...I can say the Prickly Pear was the best Ive had in a while. The Ahi Tostadas followed & they were awesome...the sauce added a kick to it & it was a perfect start to the meal. After, we shared the Fuego Pasta with chorizo, chicken, mushrooms, peppers, & a chipotle cream sauce...huge! What I did eat of it was delicious. My favorite (and my dates Im fairly certain) was the special...an herb crusted Mahi Mahi with a pineapple sauce, home-made cornbread, & chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes. Amazing. Even though the Mahi Mahi might be hard to come by if you visit, the two sides arent & are so good, Im droolin just thinking about it. :) Dessert? Try the banana burrito. Heaven on the tongue! Kevin was an excellent server which just highlights the night. Its hard to have a great meal without great service but he provided just that. If youre in the area...check it out. If you arent...check it out. Im pretty sure you wont be disappointed."
5,"Easy 5 star fun at the Phoenix Zoo. Ive never seen critters so closeup before. At the Monkey Village, they dont even have cages. The giraffes came right up to us. I spent half my beer money on fishheads and shrimp feeding the stingrays. It was a blast! We had great time! yow, bill PS - Ive never commented on other peoples reviews before. But jeez. When someone goes to the zoo and complains about the cost of a hot dog or a snow cone... well, for spider monkeys sake, get a clue!"
1,"Lets just say i was not to please with my experience at Nails R Us. After two days my nails were lifting on about 4 nails by the end of the weekend i had 6 nails lifting, so i went back and showed them and she was like its normal. No it normal to lift but not after 2 days! They did fix them for me free of charge but were very rude to me!!! Will not be going back there or will not refer any of my friends there!"
5,"Love it, love it, love it! I have been eating at various Pita Jungles around the Valley since I moved to AZ over 6 years ago and I have yet to have anything that I didnt love. My favorites include the Black Bean Burger, Lentil Fetoosh Salad, all three hummus types, dolmas, and gazpacho, but everything is delicious, so you really cant go wrong! The Tempe location also has breakfast, which is amazing!  Each location is fairly small, so luch and dinner may require a short wait, but its worth it. The prices are fair and the portions are huge! Dont be afraid to split a dish with a loved one."
3,"My boyfriend, myself, and his 3 year old foster sister met up with his mom, dad, and 2 year old foster sister. We were all heading up to Prescott this past Saturday (1/30) to play in the snow. When we got there, they were already set up with drinks & pancake balls (strange, yet greasy & delicious). Theyd placed our orders as well since they texted us for them when we were still 15min or so behind them. The food was good. The service was just okay this time since I cant remember if anyone ever came to give refills on anyones drinks. I know they came by and asked if everything was okay a few times, but that was it. Still, friendly staff. The bathrooms werent anything spectacular, but its a bathroom...at a Dennys.  Anyways, we all left full and went on about our day."
4,"Neiman Marcus is a great addition to my shopping go-to locations like Nordstrom, and well, Nordstrom. I usually only shop at Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus, sometimes Saks. Anyway. Neiman Marcus has impecable customer service but know that you kind of need to ""dress up"" to shop here. At least I feel uncomfortable if I come in in yoga gear. The selection is a nice compliment to Nordstrom -- much more tailored and designer specific. My boyfriend loves their mens section.  I love their selection of Chanel handbags and other great purses. Plus, the layout of the store is just luxurious and calming. They dont carry MAC here but I love the Chanel, Christian Dior, and Laura Mercier counters.  My ONLY complaint is their hours. Ugh. They close at 7 Monday through Saturday and 5 on Sunday. Its an hour earlier than the rest Scottsdale Fashion Square so there have been many times where Ive trekked from Nordstrom to Neimans only to find they are closed.  If you dont want to go through the mall there is complimentary valet at Neimans. You can park in their private lot but its on a hill and narrow so if Im feeling rushed I just valet....but Im also not the best at parking. NOTE: the only credit card they accept is AMEX. Otherwise its cash or check. Thats right, no Visa, no Mastercard"
3,"Closed?  Really?  It seems this place just randomly shut down, after much less than a year of being open.  Only went there once - we enjoyed the food, the ambiance, and the beer.  We recommended it to others as well.  Showed up on a Tuesday night for dinner and everything was packed up....?  A little searching on the web (Facebook, specifically) shows that theyre done.  What a shame."
1,"I do not like this KFC ...or any really for that matter. Every time I have been here the place is filthy. I know they remolded the place and I have not been since then, so I am not sure if the conditions are the same. The food is just not good in any way anymore. Not that it was ever great, but you could get some decent chicken and some sides and be content. What the hell have they done to the mac & cheese? It is so gross..the color is just not appealing and the taste is worse. Food at this place has been served under temperature enough times to keep me from returning."
1,yuk! service and food sucked never a gain!
5,"I have been exploring more of the park recently.  I want to add that the National Trail (which is almost 15 miles long and goes from one end to the other) is a real gem.  The views on this trail are outstanding, and on the western half, you will find far fewer people than on the eastern half.  Highly recommended."
4,"I feel like an East Coast gangster when I roll up to LGO for breakfast. Ill take the Jersey Girl... pump fist and hair toss!! Hands down, its the BEST omelette Ive EVER had. And the fresh-squeezed OJ hits the spot.  After a hike at Camelback, its relaxing to come and sit on the patio... if you can find a spot. Weekends this place is a zoo!! During the week is pretty crazy but has its peaks.  The French Toast is pretty tasty and they do pastries just right. Muffins are baked fresh, toast is always spot on perfect. I want their toaster! Ive had the pizza, which is pretty decent but not the best Ive eaten. The salads are delish."
5,"I love Tasty Kabob!  Their food is always excellent, and I try to make it back there whenever I return to the Valley.  I always order their chicken shish kabob entree, which comes in a generous portion that includes rice and grilled vegetables.  The chicken is always tender, well-marinated, and equally well-seasoned.  Their beef shish kabob entree is also very good. Try shaking a little sumac spice onto the rice and meat for some extra flavor, or just enjoy it as is.  Its difficult to choose from their list of appetizers and side dishes, but their hummus is always creamy and smooth, and I love their shirazi salad.  Their spicy beans dish, however, is, by far, my personal favorite, and I always make sure to order it.  Just as important as the food is the friendly service I encounter whenever I visit.  The couple who own the restaurant always make you feel welcome.  Good food and service that makes you feel at home, what more can you ask for?  Simply put, Tasty Kabob is one of the best."
5,"Really great food and service, and it worked out just fine for my two kids, ages 7 and 10. (Meatball pizza was a hit for the younger one; the older one shared sausage pizza and mussels.) The food came very quickly. We had all small plates and pizza, not entrees: kale chips, fried chickpeas, peppers, mozzarella salad. Dessert was great. The mousse was first rate, and the parsnip creme brulée was delicious (though we couldnt taste any parsnip; it just tasted like excellent, flavorful creme brulée). One of the best meals we had in Arizona. And we also really liked the decor. Simple, elegant, and also fun/creative. Not sure why anyone would ding them for that. Also, the portion sizes were just fine. We all left full but not feeling gross. Were from MA, and were unaware of the chefs celebrity. I wonder if some of the griping here is just celebrity bashing, or a reaction against some sort of hype? Im outside that loop, but it just struck us as an excellent and fun place with great food and no pretension. Just thorough competence. Note: Its a nice walk from the Arizona Biltmore Hotel. Under 2 miles."
4,"Try the deep dish, the smallest size can easily feed 3-4 people, its SOOO think and yummy.  Great staff and food, what more can you ask for?"
4,"Best pizza Ive had in Arizona hands down. My best friend lives in AZ, my friends and I stopped by this place and enjoyed surprisingly wonderful tasting pizza a must try. When I went here they were playing underground hip-hop which I am a fan of. It made it a great atmosphere to enjoy my food. I highly recommend this place I live in California and this place still comes to mind. Great for college students and the fam bam."
3,Been closed for a long time.
4,"I stopped by early this morning to satisfy my crave for something new. The place is very clean and a man came out to greet me and was ready to serve. He clearly explained every item I was curious about since the labels were in Spanish. I asked if his name was Miguel and he said yes. I told him I read about his bakery on Yelp. Then he said that he loves Yelp and thats how word is going around now for him and he also uses to find reviews on other places. He was very friendly and had lots of patience. I was the only customer at the time and he actually doesnt mind having a conversation unlike open ended talks with others. I ended up buying 10 pastries and it cost $6.80. What a great deal! They also sell other items such as tamales, burritos, and menudo. I inquired about the burritos cuz I like mine with a little kick,but unfortunately they werent ready yet. He showed me the homemade tortillas and he says he used them on the burritos. He said they dont look big, but he assured that the burritos are filled with red (mild) or green (with a kick) chili, shredded pork, and some potatoes. He said that one burrito is good to fill up a person. So...I must come back and try it.  So far Ive had the flaky pastry with the shredded coconut and Bavarian cream...the Bavarian wasnt as creamy than Im used to. I almost thought it would have been better off to not have it, but its a nice added flavor when you eat it all together rather than just tasting the Bavarian on its on.  I had that curvy, pretty looking pastry which is topped with crystal sugars and with all the sugar on top, I thought it might be too sweet, but nope. It was just fine with the pineapple filling (excuse me as I wipe my drool).  Then it was off to have the caramel flautas dusted with powdered sugar. The first bite was eh. The second bite was...um. Third bite, WOW! I finally reached the part that had more caramel in it and I LOVE IT!!! Did I mention that Im not a big fan of caramel? This caramel is sweet and creamy. Its just so good! A definitely must have for next time. Thats about as much my tummy let me eat for today. Im sure the rest will be just as good and I cant wait till tomorrow morning to try to rest of my goodies."
4,"This Chilis isnt a lot different than the one on Mill.  However, not being on Mill does have its advantages with not being full of college kids all the time.  The service is pretty good and its crowded all that often.  You can have a quiet dinner here more than at the one on Mill.  Pretty good Chilis here."
2,Dont get Breonna as your server. Didnt ask if we wanted another drink after we decided to stick to appetizers. She didnt appear to know where the water was or remembered we were at one of her tables. Food was good as always.
2,"I love love love consignment stores...and walking in this store, the smell was great...  however... I have to say i am disappointed with My Sisters Closet. I had heard such great things, so I was really excited to go. They did have some amazing designer purses, including a $3400 jimmy chu purse that was huge and gorgeous for $1899.   The designer section clothing was hung on nice wooden hangers with their logo (Nice touch).  However....... The items I saw around the store, and my friend with me agreed, seemed like more than 40% really were more appropriate for a thrift store, and a lot of the items were really dirty (and still had high prices). You could see food stains on a dooney bag.. a coach wristlet, black, had white food smeared all over it... still highly priced for as dirty as it is. The thing is... even if it is a brand.. sometimes your store reputation is worth more than the 10 bucks youll make by selling something dirty. Just my .02.  I saw sensors put though jeans pockets, wallets (in the leather!) and other questionable placements. When I asked about it.. the sales person just said, well maybe there is someone new who does not put it in the right place. That damages items people are buying, and they may not realize the big holes placed by those sensors.  I loved there ""on the web"" tags. Ive never seen that before, but they are really pretty and catch your eye if you want to take a closer look.  I prefer consignment stores to identify the sizes on the hanger by color coding or some such to make it easier to find my sizes. I get bored really fast trying to find my size..  As a consumer, I would have spent more time looking had I been able to really scan the racks easier for size. The shoes are nicely organized.... and clearly labeled. They were not over crowded so it was easy to see the shoes.  There are some positives.. I purchased a le sportsac tiny bag for 9.99, it was new so i do feel it was a good deal.  but really be careful what you buy.. The prices for the purses seemed high for used resale and their obvious usage stains."
3,"No frills.  Nothing fancy.  Just some honest burritos and tacos.  Voted ""best taco"" by New Times a few years back (in the 90s).  Not sure I agree, but they consistently satisfy.  They make a hearty breakfast burrito too.  If youre looking for Sonoran or Tex-Mex or anything beyond what you might find at Filibertos, try somewhere else.  The red burro combo is my personal favorite.  Its saucy (enchilada style) and just spicy enough.  Bottled beer available."
5,great place to go and the pizza ia great too
5,"Awesome place!! EXCELLENT food/apps(try the bleu cheese figs)! Ask for Dizzy Dre, hes AWSOME and listens to your likes and customizes drinks for you!! Very patient with women!! ;)"
4,Yum! Steaks were great! Corn bread large portions definitely worth the price!
1,"IHOP is barely a step up from Dennys in terms of boring chain food. Last night was the first time I ever had dinner there, and it tasted like squishy, mushy cardboard. The food took forever even though there were only three tables in the place with customers. The reason I gave it two stars instead of you is because the breakfasts are pretty good. I dont mind them except the omlettes which are way too oily. The coffee is almost bad, but the waitresses always look happy. [update April 2, 2011] Whyd I go back? I hate this place now. We went today for the first time we have all had a chance to go out together for breakfast. I was excited to do this and was eager. I shouldve stayed home. My wife got a waffle with her combo that was cold, tasted like cardboard, and was crunchy. The bacon my wife and child ordered was burnt, crispy and did not look like bacon at all. My sausage (I always upgrade to turkey sausage since the regular pork kid here is vomit worth) was totally cold. I sent it back and complained. I think she microwaved my plate.  Their coffee is always burnt so I got an iced coffee. She said they had Mocha, Vanilla, or Hazelnut. I asked if they just had a regular coffee flavored one... she said yes, and brought me disgusting hazelnut (glad Im not allergic!!) Ok now its three hours later. My daughter laid on the floor whining about how bad her stomach hurts, Ive been to the bathroom twice and my wife is asleep because she said if she didnt lay down, she would puke. Seriously. The management (district managers) really need to care enough to read YELP.  They remodeled the outside of this place and, I guess, spent all their money to make it look pretty so wed forget they serve dogfood."
5,"This place was great. When one of my coworkers sent an email to our group who was visiting Phoenix saying he had gotten us a reservation at ""The BEST pizza in the country"" i Was skeptical. Best pizza in Phoenix? Well, I wasnt disappointed!  We had a group of 8., and we ordered almost one of everything on the menu: Apps: Antipasto - Wood Roasted Vegetables, Sopressata, Bite of Cheese Spiedini - Italian Fontina wrapped in Prosciutto di Parma, served warm  Pizza: MARGHERITA - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Basil  MARINARA - Tomato Sauce, Oregano, Garlic (No Cheese)  ROSA - Red Onion, Parmigiano Reggiano, Rosemary, AZ Pistachios  SONNY BOY - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Salami, Gaeta Olives  BIANCOVERDE - Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula  WISEGUY - Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage  Of all of them, the Biancoverde was my absolute favorite! I dont eat pork, so I couldnt sample them all, but Id happily order this one again. In fact, my team is returning next week for another team dinner for the coming Phoenix trip, and I will for sure be ordering this. Their house draft beer is also quite tasty! Tip - if you are a party of 6-10, get a reservation! They dont take reservations for smaller groups and Ive heard the wait time can be a few hours at the busiest times! But worth it!"
5,We Care Family Wellness Center is the most exceptional doctors office and staff that I have ever found. Every employee here genuinely cares about you. I highly recommend.
3,"meh...... Im torn. I found this store to be a little bit of a walking contradiction.(okay, not ""walking"" but you dig what Im saying)  Reminds me of myself in alot of ways....not all of which are good.   You see, I recycle EVERYTHING at work because the cute little receptacles are provided for me by waste management thus leading me to not actually think about what Im doing. Plus, I co-manage a 26 story high rise mid-town and with the whole ""green"" movement, wed be setting ourselves up for some major problems if we didnt comply with demand and of course, it does just ""make sense"".     At home, not so much and to be blunt I dont really think twice about it. (go on.....hate)  This is how I feel about Fresh & Easy. Hybrid parking (fkn ridiculous) but no bike rack?? WTF??.....  Tons of bullshit organic produce and no preservatives  but then everything has been super sealed in some weird plastic containers. The F&E brand crapola that I tried was mediocre at best,  also,  it seemed like everything I picked up was within a day of expiration.  I dont know about you F&E. We could be kindred sprits.... but two wrongs dont always make a right."
2,I stopped in for a quick lunch and I wasnt impressed at all.  I heard that the food was good but Ive had better subs almost anywhere.  They have very limited toppings.  I wish I had gone to Mr. Goodcents down the street much better quality subs.
3,just another big store with everything everywhere.
3,"In my effort to live and love local, I try to show Bashas some love since they are a locally owned chain. Everything about this Bashas is just OK. The produce, inventory and service are all par but nothing stands out. I recently bought several baked goods from this Bashas for an event. I was on the hunt for sugar cookies that Santas little elves could decorate during a shopping crawl. They didnt have any out, so I asked the lady behind the counter. She told me they had cookies in the back for a dollar a piece. This was too high for my budget so I politely declined. Then a couple minutes later, she came back and told me they were actually on sale and only $.50, so I decided to buy them. Coincidence that I said no to cookies for a $1 and then they became 50 cents, or just oversight by the employee? Who knows....  During my visit, I also purchased some donuts. I need two dozen donuts and unfortunately they dont have donuts by the dozen pre-made so I ended up making my own. While this is good because you can choose your own, I think it would also be helpful to have pre-made dozens for those in a huge hurry (like I was that day).  In summary, this Bashas is just OK, but I love supporting local so I will continue to shop here!"
4,Was in Phoenix for a softball tournament this past weekend and stayed here cause it was one of the host hotels for the tournament.   Front desk staff were friendly and fast so check in was a breeze.  The room was great. Had 2 double beds in a separate room and a queen size pull out. Beds were comfortable and linens were above normal hotel quality. Bathroom was big...though it contained the closet which was kinda weird. Towels were over sized and very soft. Small balcony was nice.  Parking was in a structure next to the hotel and we never had a problem. Loved the atrium like interior of the hotel.  The only cons I can think of were ...the elevators were kinda slow. ...the toilet didnt flush right away and you had to hold the handle down a few seconds. ...and the hash browns at the breakfast buffet were extremely dry hahaha Over all this hotel is a very nice one to stay at and I would definitely stay here again if I am ever in Phoenix again.
5,"If youre at all a ""Foodie"" you cant come to Phoenix, or anywhere within 50 miles and not visit Matts Big Breakfast.  The wait outside is just part of the ambiance and culture of this tiny little place.  I hope they dont very enlarge this place....it would so spoil it. Food....have anything.  Its all cooked to perfection with love and kindness from a kitchen staff that really cares about freshness.  My personal favs are the Waffle and Bacon and the multi grain toast with the fresh jam typically made locally....changes frequently.  This was on Diner, Drive-ins and Dives a few years ago and its still the same bustling place as when Guy was there. Side note...this was way cool.  On our last visit there were 4 of us, and if youve been here you know there are only a couple of tables that seat 4.  So were waiting outside when the server comes out hands us menus, takes our orders.  When were seated about 15 min. later our food was delivered within minutes of being seated.  Helped us get in and out and helped them move a table.  Much appreciated service."
4,"modified is a great place to see a show.  it almost reminds me of basement shows back home- intimate, smelly, people utterly engrossed in the music, all ages.  its good stuff."
5,"I grew up in Arizona and we went to Wongs every Sunday after church.  Three years ago we got stationed in Hawaii.  Everytime I come home, our first stop is Wongs.  I love everything about it.  Wongs is my comfort food."
3,"Service here sucks.  Our ""waitress"" took forever to get our food, and then didnt bring utensils, plates or napkins.  I had to keep going up to the bar to get a drink.  Several times I waited too long.  One time I went up there and there was no one working there.  I should have just put on an apron and walked behind the bar myself and made my own drink.  Still, they have an awesome set up outside for enjoying the warm Phoenix nights.  I dont understand why the band has to play inside.  I guess people who live nearby complained about the noise.  Then dont live next to a f*cking bar!!! Idiots."
4,"I cant dance..yes I can!  Well tonight the hubby and I took our first dance lesson and what a hoot!  Had a blast.  The instructors approach was clear and easy to follow.  She did a great job at blending focus on the instruction with keeping it fun and upbeat.  The facility is pleasant, immaculate and huge - and available to students for practice at any time, not just during their lessons. As mentioned in a previous review, they have a great deal for first time students.  The best thing for couples is that the price per lesson is the same whether for a single or a couple.   Because Ive only done one lesson, and my first dance lesson every (well since high school, but the dinosaurs because extinct since then),  Im looking forward to more lessons and the opportunity to add a star."
4,"Their rolls are super inventive....and they stay open later than most Sushi Places in the Valley (2am).   Their Happy Hour is insane! Ex: 99 cent beers on Tuesday! Ive never had a disappointing meal here, and I am pretty hard to please when it comes to sushi. Recommendations: Signature Roll Squid Salad Yellowtail Collarbone Drinks, Drinks...drinks. They have a little karaoke room, and full bar you can make use of as well. 1 Thing: When its busy, be prepared to order everything at once...or you will be waiting."
1,"If you are over 24 you are too old to be here.   First, this place has beer.  Dont order mixed drinks, dont order wine, both are gross unless your sole purpose is to get trashed, which is the mission of every underage and young, young 20-something at this bar. This is the place youd go to with your fake ID because when youre 19 this is what you think a bar should be. Expect people over drinking and throwing up very early on in the evening in the bathroom."
4,Not your typical deli meat-this is the real deal with the shredded turkey.  Very good.
5,"Changing Hands is the perfect bookstore. These types of places just dont seem to exist, but Changing Hands has managed to survive. Allow me to begin by saying that this bookstore does not have anywhere near the selection of a Barnes and Noble (or probably a Borders, but I dont go into that garbage store and cannot be sure). With that said, there are a few reasons to shop here. First, and most importantly, they have well priced used books. I believe most of their used books are $7.50. They are also all in pristine condition. Now, $7.50 used isnt always that great for a paperback. You can do better online quite often. Whats notable, however, is that their hardcovers are typically $7.50 as well. This is a fantastic price and is hard to beat. Second, the location of CH is perfect. This is one of the best plazas out there. Wildflower, Trader Joes, Macs, Jamba Juice--you cant go wrong. Third, and finally, Changing Hands is a local store, and many good things come with that. The staff is extremely friendly. From what I can tell, they are all hardcore book nerds and you have to love that. The store also has a very welcoming feel to it. Once youre in, you will realize how extremely friendly everyone is. No, not just the staff--the customers. Everyone is talkative, friendly, and just seems to be happy. They are all indulging in one of their hobbies in one of the most inviting stores I have ever seen. Someone will ask the staff ""who wrote such and such?"". The staff will almost assuredly spot a regular and ask him or her  ""who wrote such and such"". If he doesnt know, someone else will  probably pipe up. Its this type of thing that makes it a great store. Overall, it just has a great atmosphere. The only negative comment I can make about Changing Hands is how hippy it is. Theres a ton of books on spiritual techniques, new age methods, buddhism, and whatever the hell else hippies/hipsters think makes them look more cultured. Of course, this just goes along with the Tempe, Trader Joes, and book reading demographic, so I cant blame them for meeting the inherent demand."
3,"The last three times I have been here, the hostesses have been so incredibly rude I have to update and ding them a star. The last time was the last straw and we just left turned around and left. Yes, you work at a popular property. That does not entitle you to be rude and nasty. Its weird as it seems to limited just to the front of the house. The waitstaff is usually great, food is great, and cocktails are top notch. Whoever is running this place, its time for a sit down with your girls in the front."
4,"Always drop by this place when im in tempe.  Usually i do not like greek/mediterranean food, but this place is the exception.  They give you pretty large servings of food when you order the dinners.  I always get the lamb and beef plate.  Comes with bread, meat, vegetables and some white cream sauce.  All in all an excellent combination.  Throw in the low prices and you got yourself a winner."
5,We loved this place.
5,We started each morning of our vacation at The Breakfast Club.  Everything was so tasty; juices are fresh-squeezed.  Menu has quite a variety and portions are very filling  It gets busy early.  Be sure to give it a try.
3,No bad for a chain.
4,"Oh.  Mah.  Gawd. Let me get this out of the way.. the ONLY reason Im dumping a star on Americas Taco Shop is because they charge extra for chips and salsa.  I HATE that.  Charge me if I ask for extra salsa or something, but otherwise, come on.   Now.  Said chips?  Perfect.  Salsa?  Perfecter.  My taco?  Made me cry a little bit.  I am picky about corn tortillas, but these were brilliant. Go to Americas Taco Shop.  I will see you there."
5,"These guys helped me out with my rear windshield wiper.  They could have just shrugged their shoulders and said they didnt have the part, but they worked with me and tried a couple of different options until we found a solution.  Everyone I encountered was great."
5,"Dr. Ken Danyluk and his team offer an Extraordinary Orthodontic experience.  Team Orthodonitcs offers many Orthodontic soluitions for all ages.  Whether patients choose traditional braces, Invisalign or ""Hidden Brace"" lingual braces behind their teeth, they always leave happy!"
3,"I stumbled upon this Fridays while walking around Phoenix on a Sunday afternoon.  I wanted to just go up and have a drink and then take some pictures of the empty baseball field.  Phoenix was completely empty! When I got closer to Chase Field there were some more people and I realized that there was a game going on!  I didnt think I would be able to get into Fridays because of the game; however, it wasnt very busy!  I sat at the bar since I was by myself.  But once I was there awhile, I noticed there were still tables open looking out into the ballpark.  So basically you get to watch the game for free as long as you are ordering stuff.  I thought that was pretty cool. As for the food/drink... I ordered a daiquiri when I sat down.  It was pretty bad.  Almost too slushy.  I looked through the menu and asked if they had any smaller portions or lunch portion.  I was told that since it was a game day they have a different menu and everything is larger.  So I didnt order any food. The service was good.  The waiter was nice and another waitress named Kimmy even came up and talked to me for a little while.  Id definitely come here again just for the view."
5,"Beautiful parish, also home to the amazing Legacy Ballroom that is available for wedding receptions and events.  The annual Middle East food festival is a wonderful family event with fantastic food, pastry, and entertainment!"
5,"Today our travels took us to the Chandler Mall on 10/31/2012. Therefore we were near to Abuelos for lunch. Nothing like returning to a Restaurant that you found to be very good! We arrived after 1PM, so we were seated ASAP. We ordered drinks first along with a serving of Guacamole. Nice way to start off lunch! My wife ordered the Dilla Lunch while I ordered the Grande Burrito Lunch special. Both item arrived on a very hot plate-wonderful! Whenever we are dining at another Restaurant, a hot plate is always expected but all too often the hot plate fails to appear. Our lunch stay hot until the last bite due to the hot plate service. Everything was great with the meal and no requested drink refills-always a sign of great service! Both restrooms were very clean and serviced many times during the day. We highly recommend Abuelos for a great lunch or dinner!"
5,"If I could give it more than 5, I would.  Sweet Pea and I live down the street, literally DOWN THE STREET, from this bar.  We waited for it to open for what seemed like decades, praying that this was going to be the type of place that could become our local.  It has exceeded our expectations.  The atmosphere is amazing.  The drinks are amazing- every last one of them- but the margaritas are the best Ive ever had.  They tasted like a fresh squeeze of sunshine that makes me happy inside.  Margarita Mondays- $4 margs AND free food?  Happy hours are amazing.  New Years Eve last year was amazing.  The 1 year anniversary party was amazing.  But most of all, the owner and staff are some of the coolest peeps that youll ever meet.  Go here.  You will love it."
5,"Thank you Sunflower for having a decent selection of tofu and fake meats so I dont have to drive 25 minutes to Whole Foods. Also I would like to tell you that I really enjoy your produce prices and your friendly staff, especially the cashiers, they are always so pleasant and helpful. While I am at it I should probably apologize for ""sampling"" lots of your candy from the bulk item bins, those chocolate covered peanut butter filled pretzels are amazing, I promise I always use the scoop. And one more thing, its really awesome that you carry beers brewed by Rinkukiu Alaus Darykla, the Lobster Lover is DELICIOUS!"
5,"Consistent with the east coast stores, great flavor selection, friendly and accommodating staff.   The regular size doesnt look big but it is plenty for the price, not to mention the staff consistently fills above the top the cup on all products.   A much better value than Cold Stone, Baskin Robbins, and self serve froyo."
4,"Sadly received this email today: Sabatinos is Closed You know we have been experiencing a lack of sales which we can blame on the economy, new restaurants opening here in the valley (most likely for much less cost than us original places), we tried to work with our landlord, but he would not budge on lowering our rent. We just could not afford the 5500.00 this month and were afraid we would lose everything in our place to a Lockout, which was threatened to us already. We just wanted to say goodbye to all of our loyal customers, we really enjoyed having you come in weekly and keeping up with your lives as well as you keeping up with ours. We will probably be leaving the Az area and starting over fresh.   God Bless   Kevin and Sheri"
4,"Sweet Potato Tater Tots..................why are you still reading?  what more needs to be said?  Yum Yum getcha some! The only thing keeping them from 5 stars is their unwillingness to enforce rules with parents who bring kids and think everybody else wants to enjoy watching them run around the place like its a playground, its NOT - keep your kids at the table or at home."
5,"OK, being from Wisconsin (the land of the ""great lakes"") I was COMPLETELY surprised to be told that, yes, there are lakes here in the desert of Arizona.  The Lake, Saguaro Lake, is a man made lake originally built as Stewart Mountain Dam...even so, its beauty is equal to those you would see in the glacier regions of the Midwest.  I was amazed, frankly, at how beautiful this tour was.  Sold for $18 for 90 minutes, you get your moneys worth.  But that is probably not what you want to hear... The ""event"" is a combination of 1) the scenery, and also 2) the charm of the paddle boat itself.  The boat is quite large with seating for probably close to 75 people!  Its an event that you could share with family, but I happened to be there with friends.  Currently, its a pretty mellow type of event (great for Mothers Day!), although I am told that they are hoping to exploit its benefits to include comedy shows, Jazz ensembles, stargazing, and a variety of other events. P.S.  They also advertise that you can rent the paddle boat for company picnics, weddings, and the like."
4,"There are bunch of different tours. I went on the hour long one (probably the cheapest one as well) where I didnt see the bedrooms or inside of the house. It was very hot coming here on a summer day - I do NOT recommend it. They do provide you with water and a red umbrella though.  I learned a lot about architecture from the tour and why certain things were done. I would recommend coming here during the fall seasons because they mentioned you can see the tents out there.  So quick summary - basically, Frank Lloyd Wright would live at this place during the winter months when it was warm in Arizona but super cold where hes from. He didnt come here during the summer months - way too hot!"
4,"Im rating this place as a Music Venue and Bar, not as a restaurant.  UBs seems to be hosting a slew of Metal shows over the next 3 months, which is good to see a place open its arms and bar to the metal community.  As far a heavy metal venue goes, its run of the mill. It has enough room to either mosh or sit in the booths along the back wall.  As far as the bar, the prices seemed slightly on the high side, especially for the ""dive-ness"" this place exhibits.  Their beer menu had 4 or 5 typos on it, just something to chuckle at, such as Rolling Rook beer, ODools, and listed Fat Tire as an import. (Cuz Colorado is SO FAR way).  Luckily, beer and metal go together, so people tend to pay.  The old man in the Bolo tie checking IDs was definitely a good sport."
3,"Good vibe - and outstanding location - they definitely work well with a large group (10), delivering orders to the right person without asking ""who gets ...""  LOVE THAT KIND OF SERVICE.  And not once, NOT ONCE, did the service people call any of our group ""guys"" (okay, okay, a pet peeve of mine).  Horseradish potatoes are a bit salty -- and prime rib serving is definitely less than generous.  That said -- the fish and chips were great, as were (according to one of our party) the pork and beans.  Desserts are HUGE -- share with 2 or 3 others."
4,"My husbands former employer said when we get to Phoenix we must go to In-N-Out. He said the last time he had one there was a line out the door. Not much of a beef burger person, we stumbled upon this burger joint as we left Ikea and decided to try it. The emergency granola bar I keep in my purse wasnt working. There was no line out the door, who wants to wait in line anyway. We both ordered a cheeseburger (no tomato, no special sauce, no ketchup for me). It arrived in a card board container which was kinda cute and everything was hot and fresh. My burger has a thick slice of onion and several crispy lettuce leaves. The burger itself was just okay, but the freshness of the toppings won me over. My husbands had a big slice of tomato.  Did In-N-Out live up to the hype from his former employer? Not exactly, but it came pretty close."
4,"I have just relocated to Scottsdale and eager to find a great wine bar and/or restaurant with a great wine list...and 5th and Wine was the one place that everyone recommended, so I was eager to check it out! I decided to check it out one night after work, and asked a few co-workers for some delish food choices to try...the bruschetta was the one to try! I loved the ambiance, very social atmosphere, nice bar scene and small tables, but they also had another room for tables further away from the bar which was more chill and quiet atmosphere.  I was quickly seated at a nice table in the more quiet area, and could scope out the scene.  I started with a delish glass of Charles LaFitte - Brut France sparking...which for $9 was a deal and refreshing! I quickly scanned the menu for the bruschetta and my mouth started to water with the selections.  I opted for the prosciutto/fig/marscapone bruschetta and the standard mozzarella/tomato/basil bruschetta!  Both were totally delicious!  The bread was lightly toasted and a bit soft...not like your typical ""crunchy"" bread bruschetta...which I actually enjoyed more than I thought I would.   I ordered the Beef Bourguignon Julia Childs ""Beef, Wine, Bacon, Mushroom Stew"" over egg noodles...for $16.96...again, a total deal and totally tasty!  The beef melted in my mouth and the mushroom and sauce was hearty and flavorful! All in all, the meal was wonderful, and the service was great - very attentive staff - Jonathan, my waiter, was super personable. I also met Scott Yanni, one of the owners, who came over to see how my meal was...and he was very gracious when I told him that I just relocated here and was very happy to find his restaurant as one of my new favorites! I will definitely be back for more of their great menu and tasty libations!"
4,"This is about a 3.5 star mexican place to me. Ive always had good service but watched other folks get like 1-star service, at a level I might not come back. I like the White Chimichanga here. The Chili Verde is decent, and the Hatch Chilis are nice too, if you havent had those. 4 Stars - White Chimi 3 Stars - Chili Verde 3 Stars - Cheese crips with Hatch chilis Im sure there are better places around but Ive been coming here for several years when in the area, and I definitely enjoy this place. Sometimes they have hot chicks working up front. If you keep up this practice Arriba, Ill five-star you sometime soon!"
3,Pizza crust & toppings are excellent. However the pizza sauce was too salty. Im willing to try again later.
3,"I dont drink, so my review will not be intoxicated by anything except the building.  I gave it two stars for the building.  They did a beautiful job with the remodel (Im a mid-century and Haver fan.)  The food wasnt anything to write home about.  I have to admit that Im particularly tough on restaurants filled with...I dont know what to call them...scenesters, I guess.  Service was ok.  Its not BAD, mind you, its just that I dont get it.  I guess if youre paying with credit cards all the time, you dont care how much mediocre food costs, as long as it makes you feel cool about eating there."
3,I thought this bagel shop was ok. The bagel sandwich I got was relatively lackluster. I think I will stick to Einsteins for the time being.
4,"I met up with a friend for dinner here the other night. Its a little far from me, unfortunately; if this was within a few miles of me, Id be here a -lot-.   For starters, the place is easy to miss. Its a hole in the wall. Its very small inside, only a few tables; definitely consider takeout.    That said, if its not busy, dont be afraid to stay. We ate in; when there was a significant lull in the crowd, the girl behind the counter came both to clear our tables and to deliver a second item I ordered a bit later in the evening. I wish Id been carrying cash, there is a tip jar by the register, and I would have loved to have left something for that.    The food...ah, the food. Great bang for the buck. Have I had better tacos? Yes. Once, handmade by a Mexican immigrant my mother was good friends with, as we joined her for a family dinner. In restaurants? No. This is good Mexican street food, small hand made corn tortillas with flavorful, moist meat on them, and some warm salsa on top. Lovely. They even offer lengua, for those that like it, a very nice touch.    As others have said, the rice is very good; I wasnt actually that fond of the beans though.    Is this place worth going 20 minutes out of your way? Unfortunately, no, hence the 4 star. But is it worth going to if youre already nearby? Yes, very much yes."
1,"I give this review a total 1 star If I was able to, I would have rated no stars at all!.... I would NEVER reccomend ANYONE to live here. The office staff is horrible and made me feel uncomfortable the whole year I lived there based on THEIR MISTAKES! I can not express how disappointed I am with the way that they have treated me....."
5,"Dr Brodkin is one of the greatest doctor out there.  She was voted two years in a row for arizona foothill top doctor and it shows!!!  She is caring, and overall great doctor.  She moved her office last year and wow did she change for the best.  The staff is great her new nurses i love love love....i recommend Dr Brodkin to anyone who need  a GYN...."
5,"My wife and I as well as several of our friends drive from Ahwatukee on a regular basis to dine at Flos on Thompson Peak and Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd. 25 miles isnt too far for this food. Weve been eating here since the 90s and have always been pleased. I discovered it when I worked in the area and used to stand in line for lunch, it was so busy. Our favorites: Lemon Pepper Chicken with extra lemon wedges and the Kung Pow although I cant think of anything I wouldnt order."
5,Great place.  Hard to see behind Carls Jr. on Southern Ave but is Worth finding!
3,"Yelper Jane Bs review is remarkably similar to what I intended to include in my review. Weve stayed at close to a dozen different Homewood Suites over the years and this one left us wishing we could have stayed at any of the others instead. Furnishings were adequate but not terribly comfortable.  The living room had a sleeper sofa and a side chair, a dining table with two chairs, an end table, a coffee table, and a TV stand with 3 drawers plus the kitchenette, all in a room roughly 9 x 14. The bedroom contained a desk with 3 drawers (serving also as the dresser) and the bed and nightstands.  The desk also served as the TV stand, allowing a small work area and taking up so much room the door couldnt swing all the way open. Our bedroom also contained the mystery deadbolted closet with unknown contents, which took up half the guest closet space. The bathroom was large but dingy and dimly lit. I considered renting an on-demand movie one evening, but everything offered by the hotel was $15+/each (!!) and since there wasnt a DVD player we didnt have the opportunity to rent somewhere more reasonable and bring it back to our room.  Free wifi seemed stable although a bit slow, and the pool was small but the kids didnt seem to mind. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was well-prepared and always had enough variety to keep the kids and adults happy. We got a great rate but hey, its Scottsdale in the summer so most rates are pretty darn good.  Normally we enjoy staying away from home, but after 6 nights here even the kids were anxious to get home. Well stay at Homewood Suites again in the future, but not this one."
3,Another place thats walking distance. Subway is one of those places where you cant go wrong....you got 5-dollar value meals or foot longs. The guys are really friendly and arent stingy with the toppings. Im not a big fan of the smell subways have though. Eh anyways its just one of those places where im lazy and dont want to make a sandwich...plus it helps me keep my girlish figure like jared :)
5,"Really good food, fun atmosphere, great experience and totally unique and fun.  I would way rather spend my money at a one of a kind, family owned shop than a cheaper- dime a dozen corporate mcdonalds."
3,"Mulligans is that place in Scottsdale you dont think of going to when youre in the mood for dancing, which is mostly why I go out in Scottsdale at night. But I always find myself there either before or after my dance trips. I totally dig the atmosphere at Mulligans - its chill, unpretentious, and never obnoxiously crowded. The prices are decent and the location is pretty centralized.  The DJ isnt always the best, but when youre with good friends and good drinks, Mulligans makes you feel at home.  Mulligans kind of has that dive bar feel but doesnt make you feel like you might get mugged and stabbed in the eye."
5,"Loooove this place! Yes its pricey, but good sushi usually is. The guys making the rolls were friendly. The atmosphere is nice. Hubby absolutely loved the quail eggs and I couldnt get enough of the spicy shrimp roll. Seriously, try it. You wont be disappointed!"
5,"This, my friends, is THE place to get some very authentic Chinese food.  The servings are HUGE for what youre paying...shucks, they are huge no matter which way you look at it so be careful not to order too much food unless you want leftovers. Who doesnt like leftover Chinese food anyway? My recommendations are the Sweet and Sour chicken, the Egg Foo Yung and the chow mein. You will not be disappointed. Youll also find the soups on the back of the menu at an average of 4 bucks or so. You will be pleasantly surprised when you get the bowl...it can feed at least 6 people. She will bring small bowls out and serve it for you right at the table. Give the hot and sour soup a try. As for the service, it depends on how you look at it. Dont be afraid to get up and refill your own water. Shoot, the waitress is the only one thats there, give her a break already. She must own the joint with her husband because there is always this little kid in the corner playing on his laptop. So, get your own water and your own take home containers if you want. She doesnt have a problem with it. Yes, the place is a little worn but you dont go there to look at pretty stuff. Its not dirty, just broke down. Youd be broke down too if you practically gave away your food in abundance to your customers. Who has money for new furniture if you take care of your customers bellies.  The lobster, crab and fish are fresh and cheap. Try finding lobster somewhere else in the valley for 10 bucks a pound, I dare ya.  So, head on out, just dont go on a Wednesday, thats their day off. They are open 11AM to 11PM every other day though. You can call in your order and pick it up if you dont want to look at the place. Oh yeah, and if you ever go in there and it smells horrid, its not the place, its a popular dish that some customers order called ""Salty Fish"". It stinks to all heck! If that plate comes out I usually pack up my food, giggle and finish my meal at home. I dont mind one bit, thats just the way it is. Oh and the waitress does speak good English, however, you wont find many Caucasians frequenting this place. That means the food is pretty authentic!"
5,"Edens Grill has to be one of my favorite, and newly discovered Middle Eastern/Mediterranean restaurant in the PHX metro. Located in a sleepy strip mall, close to Arties Ace, is EG. My partner and I had the opportunity to have dinner here a few weeks ago and we were totally wowed by everything! We started off with the hummus, followed by two orders of the vegetarian plate. The vegetarian plates were huge and featured dolmades, falafel, rice, veggie skewers and veggie patties (2). The vegetarian plate was massive and everything on the plate was delicious. Next time well pay the extra $5 and split one Vegetarian Plate instead of getting two. The pita and hummus were fresh and delicious, however, I find EGs hummus to be a a little thick for my preference and they use a heavy dose of tahini in their hummus. Overall, I would totally recommend EG to anyone with an itch for Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food but be warned, they arent open for lunch on the weekends yet."
3,"Not bad, I usually leave pretty happy and full."
5,"Wow! Being a Phoenix native, we have enjoyed many a meals at the hands of Chef Gross. But this past weekend I was blown away. I was planning a large garden party for my friends bridal shower. The record temperatures left my garden ravaged by the heat and I did not want to have sweltering ladies unable to enjoy themselves. After a small response to attendance, I decided to see what some of my favorite dining spots could offer me. I had a small budget but wanted to keep it classy. Christophers truly rose to the occasion. Alex, was my special event contact and this lady was ""on it"". Emails and phone calls were returned at lightning speed. She presented a delightful menu with plenty of choices (some even for the vegetarians attending) all with in my price range.  We had a wonderful time. We had a party of 18 in the beautiful private room that fit our festivities perfectly. Sundays can be quiet at The Biltmore Fashion Park so it lend-ed us to a bit of intimacy that was nice. Ben was our go to guy. He was right there for every thing we needed and his helpers were polite and attentive. As for the food, well, its Chris, come on! I had the vegetable risotto ans  it was cooked to perfection. All of the plates came out of the kitchen quickly and all together but no one ever made us feel rushed. Wine flowed, desserts were gobbled up and the ladies oohed and awed over everything. the staff even offered to take gifts to the car for the bride. Thanks for saving me Chef Chris and your team. You were all fabulous and I will be telling all of my friends what a great job you did. The holidays are coming and Ben reminded us that they also do catering! Hmmm, can you say ""Christmas Party""?"
4,"Im not sure how Ive missed trying this place, after over a decade of living in the Valley, partly as an ASU student in need of a good hang-over recovery joint. I cant believe I relied exclusively on the IHOP on Apache Blvd, all those years in Tempe. Dammit! It was packed on the New Years Day morning I came here with a friend. The service was a bit slow but on par with my expectations for a jam-packed popular breakfast joint on New Years Day. I ordered a calorie-laden Cajun skillet with scrambled eggs. Im knocking off a star because the chicken pieces were too dry for my taste. But the rest of the skillet was very good. The service was friendly and professional. Wildcats beware, lots of ASU students within."
5,"By far the best poker room in the state and I have played in every casino poker room in the valley. The action is always there-lots of dead money to be picked up if you know where to look. Good promotions, amazing food served table side and all the sports games you can watch. I wish they would bring back 6-12 limit but 8-16 will have to do =) such an improvement over the tents, though they will always hold a place in my heart. It sucks cause I work right next to the casino and every night after work I have a tough decision..go home to my family or go to my favorite card room and tear it up. If you havent been there-MUST GO."
4,Outside atmosphere was really nice. This was my first time there and I enjoyed it. Our food was great. I had a salad and my friend had the filet which looked excellent. It was more pricey than I expected though.
5,"Doc and Edwards has been a place of refuge for 5 years for me.  Hell, most of my friends spent their 21st birthday there.  It is hard to explain walking into a bar and just feeling at home.  It is so comfortable and wide open.  Even on the most crowded days, I feel like I am on the cast of cheers.  The employees there are good and the food is exactly what you expect.  You can also order silvermine there with no delivery charge!  The pool table rates have gone up in the last few years but if you spend a good amount of money on drinks, they waive the pool table fee. Or you could go for some ping pong, foosball, UFC, or big buck hunting.  It has a great juke box but watch out for the lady that throws 20 in and slangs the worst playlist I have ever heard. If my girl would only let me, I would have my wedding there."
4,"This place is still really new, so theyre still getting the kinks worked out, but it looks great and the film selection is awesome!   I went there the Sunday of their opening weekend to see Metropolis.  It might be a little confusing the first time you go, but you pay for your movie tickets at the bar.  They dont have paper tickets yet, they just gave me and my date little stickers. The theater has 4 or 5 rows of comfy seats and a few tables in the back for people with drinks.  Metropolis was in Blu-Ray and looked amazing.  The showing went off without a hitch.  They even gave us a free bowl of tasty snack mix to eat during the movie.  Im not a drinker so I cant comment on the bar offerings, but I think its great to have a theatre showing rad independent and classic movies downtown.  I really hope this place takes off, I can see myself visiting it often."
3,"3.5 stars! I must say, Im a total fan of their Zipps Golden Wings! Gotta love their reverse happy hour! Ordering their wings on medium is smart move, their wings are already so flavorful and sweet, that its a shame to go any hotter, since youll mask the inherent, crisp, and juicy flavor. Id say pass on the Fish Tacos, and if youre in a burger move, order the Jalapeno Burger. Sampled their beer, not bad!  Breakdown: Zipps Golden Wings ~ a MUST get! Fish Tacos ~ Yawn... Sweet Potato Chips ~ Could do again! Jalapeno Burger ~ Delish!  Overall, this is a chill spot with your better than average bar food!"
4,"My previous review has the real details about what i LOVE about their food! Update:  Doing mostly take-out here, but at least one of the grumpy girls is more friendly now!  Yesterday when I grabbed our to-go order, she smiled, made small conversation, and did not exude a sullen disposition in any way.  Im happy for me, Im happy for her! Ordered many of our usual items, plus Mongolian beef, which was very tasty. Im stil partial to the Ginger beef, however."
5,"Mostly I love the Rokerij just because I love saying the name.   But the food is also killer.  I had the most amazing chicken, and the sides, which usually I just take for granted as filler food, were sodelicious that they caught my attention in a big way.  I also tried my dates steak, and while it was fairly spendy, it sure seemed worth it. The feel of the place is great too, with the dark stone walls and coziness without feeling too crowded.  We ventured downstairs to look at the bar, and had we been there early enough to snag a couch I wouldnt have wanted to leave. It definitely feels like a splurge, or somewhere youd take a business associate or date that you wanted to wow.  Its manages a high end feel, while remaining unmistakably local.  I cant say Id suggest it just for any old night, but it will stay on top of my list for special occasions."
2,"I really liked Joes; the food and service was always good. But one bad experience has me wondering if I will ever return. The problem I had was with the service. We walked in on a weekday around 11, the place was pretty packed and there was only one server on the floor. We grabbed a table and waited about 10 minutes before she came over with water. We told her were ready to order, to which she replied ""I am really busy and have other people who need to order ahead of you."" In my 16 years as a chef, I have never heard a server say that. She didnt even offer to bring us coffee or anything. If anyone from Joes is reading this, heres a little crash course in restaurant 101...if a customer says theyre ready to order, TAKE THEIR DAMN ORDER! Anyway, we ended up walking out. Guess well be eating exclusively at Matts Big Breakfast from now on."
4,"My review is based on Terminal 3, Delta!  Getting checked in at Delta was quick, security line was quick, and returning picking up my bags was quick too!  The signs are easy to read and easy to understand.  I was in Nassau, Bahamas airport, the signs pointed everywhere!  Crazy!!"
4,"Perfect for a Quick lunch. And I mean seriously quick. Like ninja light speed fast.  Under two minutes consistently from order to table. How can you beat that! One time they clock-in at 1min 45sec for a table of five.  My favorites are the House Special Chicken, the Orange chicken and the Prawns. cant go wrong and you will leave stuffed and satisfied."
5,I really enjoyed my mani/pedi with Trisha!  She took her time and taught me about manicuring my nails from home which I loved. I went in for the Groupon basic mani/pedi deal and left feeling like I got a lot more! It was the most pleasant experience Ive had at a nail salon. The conversation was easy and Trish is a great person. I will be coming back to Trish for nails again!  The entire staff was friendly and professional. Great Salon!!
4,"Fantastic, order anything off the menu and you will be pleasantly surprised.  Best gyro Ive ever had hands down and the falafel is equally amazing.  Owner paid special attention to my boyfriend and I and made sure we were happy with everything.  Only downside is that they close for a couple hours during the day before dinner time (I believe its 2:30 to 5:30 or something like that) so I cant eat their delicious food whenever I want, haha, keep on doing what youre doing Sahara."
4,"Time flies when youre having fun... Its been almost a full year since my initial review of Bacon, and Ive been back probably ten times or more. Ive seen a lot of transition with the employees but I can say that their service has gotten much better since the beginning.  The casual atmosphere is right up my alley for a weekend breakfast, and my yogi omelette / protein pancake orders have stayed consistent too.   I was there earlier today and while the service was spot-on, I did find a piece of ham in my otherwise veggie omelette - but I overlooked it and enjoyed my meal nonetheless... My husband has been to Bacon even more than i have, and he told me he recently sampled whats to come on their new lunch menu (think pastrami sandwich).  So, go for breakfast, go for lunch, go for a Bloody Mary or a Mimosa... just kick back and enjoy your meal!"
2,"Let me start by saying I have never had BBQ I didnt like. Ive had BBQ I could do without, but never that I didnt like. Went in for lunch today and I was the only customer, so I figured cool I will get good service no matter what. The girl sat me and was very pleasant and indicated my waitress would be right over. About ten minutes later, watching the waitress talk on a personal phone call at the bar the whole time, the girl who sat me came over to take the order. She walked up, didnt say a word, and just stared at me. Ok I can live with that it was only a minor inconviencence.  Got the #4 lunch chopped pork sandwich with beans and a lemonade and it came out very quickly. Possibly because the beans were Bushs or the like? They tasted like canned baked beans heated up in a microwave. Not cool. The sandwich was ok at best. Thinking back on Stacys, Honey Bears, and other great BBQ spots, this one was not even in the same arena. Ill have to go back though and try a sandwich with the correct sauce on it. There was one sauce on the table which after reading reviews here I had assumed was the BBQ sauce. It looked a little watery but I thought whatever its NC style, and it may have been because it was a bit vinegary. On the way out I noticed every other table had a red sauce labeled BBQ, so I guess they have two different ones. I would have preferred the red one I assume.  There was no atmosphere, the place was run down (doesnt appear to have been remodeled after Shish Kabob House vacated) and was generally a dirty feeling place. Seeing as they didnt have any customers at lunch time, Im assuming the place is going to lose money today. Dont know about other days, but they better get their act together quick or it is going to fail."
5,"Total wine totally takes a crap on Bev Mo. This store has everything! The employees are also very knowledgeable. The other day we went in and my husband insisted I try red wine instead of sticking to my usual Riesling (I dont like change). So we asked one of the employees and he asked me a few questions then suggested a bottle of Malbec. The Malbec tasted amazing! I was so happy. For those of you who dont know, its not only wine! You can find everything else. Total wine has helped us stock our bar and entertain our guests. Also, dont forget to chill your bottles before you leave!"
4,I love this place.Their italian beef with hot peppers is a must. I have also tried their sausage and pep sandwich which is just as good.Their prices are as good as you can get. So if youre hungry stop in & get full!!
2,This Baja Fresh really didnt impress me.  Its pricey considering that all youre getting is meat in a tortilla.  It doesnt have that Mexican feel to it and is unoriginal.  There were bugs on the wall.  The food is good however.  Nothing special though.  Since its a corporate chain you cant expect sizzling flavor but I was left unsatisfied.  There are better Mexican food places to go to.
4,"This is a standard place to celebrate Birthdays. The drinks are delicious especially the kiwi and acai specialty drinks. The rolls are over $10, but they are unique and tasty. The environment is very cool and the location is great. Parking is bad just like everywhere in Scottsdale, you need to park in the street. Location is great because you can grab dinner here and then go out after. There is also karaoke available if you want to rent a room for a special occasion."
3,"Moved here from San Francisco, and have been searching  for decent Chinese food.  Flos has been our standby, but we tried Jade Palace on recommendations of our midwestern snowbird friends. I can only comment on the food, as we ordered take out.  Our order was ready in 15 minutes and it was complete.   I had Chow Fun, and it was the equivalent to Flos, Ok, but not spectacular, and a lot more oily.  Husband had Mongolian Beef and said that Flos was better, but the meat tasted fresher on the Jade Palace version.  Jade Palace is much closer to us, so I will try their Hot and Sour soup in the fall, which is usually the barometer I use to measure Chinese Food.  Go figure, we are now hoping for some San Francisco restaurants to relocate to Scottsdale."
2,"Still not in love with it. Again with the overstaffing and employees huddled, eating/drinking and chatting instead of hurrying up and making my drink.  it is okay to hurry--or is that just my strange, city-thinking? meh."
1,"This place used to be amazing.  My favorite memories of past years is going to this seafood place with my parents.  Its not the same anymore. We went for my wifes 30th birthday.  My dad decided to join us.  My wife ordered steak and shrimp, my dad ordered steak, I ordered a crab stuffed lobster.  I have had the crab stuffed lobster many times before.  I was craving it. We got our appetizers.  Dad got snails, wife and I shared steamers.  My dad was happy with the snails.  But then again, how can you go wrong with snails doused in garlic and butter?  The steamers were steamed little neck clams in a garlic broth.  It was not long neck clams like the rest of the world calls steamers.  I wasnt about to argue with the server that these are the wrong clams. The food came and for the first time in my life I was asking the server to take back my meal before I even tried it.  It looked dry and over cooked.  I told the server Ive had this dish many times before and this is not the way its supposed to be.  He told me this is what its supposed to look like and begged me to try it.  I took one bite and I couldnt even swallow it because it was so dry.  Of course the server was gone by this point and didnt come back for 10 minutes to ask me how it was. While I was waiting for the server to return, I told my family I was just going to get the steak.  They just shook their head and told me not to.  I took one bite of my dads steak and spat it out.  How do you screw up steak this bad?  It tasted like beef jerky and butter.  My dad and wife would have complained too, but its my wifes birthday and I am already stealing her thunder.  I swapped my meal out for a steamed lobster.  How do you screw up a steamed 1 1/2 lobster?  Fortunately, that came out fine. So we left hungry and $300 poorer.  I used to not mind paying the money they charged but now, it is not worth it.  I am really hoping people stop coming here so they can just close down."
4,"Ive never been to the former restaurant that was once housed in this quaint little building, so my first impressions may be a bit different from others.  I have always adored this house.  Its absolutely adorable and in such a good location.  I read over the weekend that the new restaurant here was opening, so we made a point to visit it sooner rather than later. We chose to go right after work, so there were only a few other people in here.  I really like the setup with the bar in its own little alcove and seating situated throughout the rest of the house.  We were greeted immediately after walking in and we sat in a table by the window.  While we perused the menus I couldnt help but tap my feet to the killer old school music they were rockin.  I ended up deciding on the grilled cheese to eat. The food was very good.  The sourdough bread was super toasty, literally grilled to perfection.  There was a ton of cheese in the sandwich, but I dont remember which kinds.  The important thing is that it was really tasty.  My only complaint is that the cheese wasnt ooey gooey.  it was melty, but I could still make out the shape of the cheese.  In my book of grilled cheese greatness, it needs to be a little messier.  The sandwich was also served with a side of chips or salad if you choose.  The chips were good and I ate them all up.  There was also a dill pickle, but I dont do dill pickles. I definitely think that this is a killer new spot that will do very well.  I have no doubt that this ultra-hip but non-pretentious spot will quickly become a neighborhood favorite."
5,"This place is so unique! I was disappointed that it was closed the weekend of my birthday in July, but I wont hold that against them! This bar/boxing ring/vintage store/food truck/soda fountain is super awesome! My cousin took me here a few years ago and since then its been a place that I always show friends and family members when they want to go out downtown. The drink list is pretty extensive, with lots of organic cocktails served in cute mason jars. You definitely get a good sized drink! The beers are cheap, the food is so-so. I think its a bit overpriced, so Id recommend eating somewhere else beforehand.  The boxing ring is random, but Ive seen friends go up there and fight in a drunken stupor, and that is a sight Ill never regret seeing. Some nights they have karaoke, which Ive chosen to partake in a few times. Ive seen DJs there on the weekends, and I really like how they switch up the music genre each time. Sometimes its rap, others rockabilly and oldies. On Tuesday nights they do FREE swing dancing lessons and Ive been really wanting to try that! i love the vintage feel to the place and am surprised its not packed all the time!"
5,"This is the best restaurant chain EVER!!!!  I love EVERYTHING there and the service has always been A+.  The fried zucchini strips (appetizer) are the best in the world, the Caesar salad is the best I ever had, even their croutons on the salad are better than any!!!  Olive oil herb dip is Fabulous, the warm bread is like no other.  Most of the dinners that I have tried have been excellent but the Chicken Bryan is magnificent.  Waiters and manager the best."
3,"I love to eat here, however it is hit or miss. Sometimes we get good service and other times we dont. Sometimes the food is really good, but other times its off. Our order is usually messed up, but they are good about fixing it. One thing I have a problem with is using coupons here, I had a coupon for a pizza and also ordered an appetizer at happy hour half off. They did not want to combine the two offers but the coupon didnt say say anything about that.  When the food is good though its really good, which is why we return."
5,"They have a limited time thing going on right now with BBQ chicken pizza (not sure how long its going to last) but let me just say it was amazing.  Probably THE best BBQ Chicken pizza I have ever had.  I have tried other things too, like the tomato basil soup, and many of their sandwiches ... very good, very fresh - every time.   The 5 stars is for the pizza, but if I were to rate Jasons Deli over all they would get about a 4."
4,No matter what I order I know it will be tasty. Maizies have a lot to choose from which can be a little overwhelming for me. I love their wait staff everyone is always friendly. When I am in Maizies I feel like I am in a neighborhood hang out.
1,"I was so, so hopeful.  October in Scottsdale, yummy, tacos.....Wow!  Rip Off!! $10 Just to get in (what was that for?). No shade unless you were buying a drink.  Most places wouldnt give you salsa or taco sauce with your measly over priced taco. They seemed like the vultures who didnt care about the customer, just the $2 ticket they could grab from you.   I had to beg for a napkin then hunt for a place to sit feeling watched by the other vultures waiting for me to get up. I was ready to leave after 45 minutes and my Pepsi had gotten warm, so I had gotten a cup of ice from the bar.   I poured it in, took one drink and as I was leaving to hike back to my car, security stopped me and would nt let me take it out! ""It could have booze in it"".  Well, by then, I was one angry little local. Dumped it all in trash and said to my sweet daughter in law who was about to ""go mad"" with me, ""Get me outta here!"". She had brought her 2 year old, thinking what a fun way to spend a Saturday morning and encourage our local businesses.  Nope.  Not good."
1,Wow?!  Is this the new Barcelona?!  Yuck!  Old scuzy men and middle aged women with fake boobs that are falling out of their painted on dresses.  All bars were completely under staffed on a Friday night.  We waited 7 minutes at the front bar until being ignored continuously and we became so frustrated that we made our way to the round bar and it seemed just as understaffed.  Whats the point of only having a few bartenders on probably the busiest night of the week for bar-goers?  We even approached the blond manager to ask for service and she was completely rude and had a total lack of desire to help us.  We will NOT return due to the lack of service and efficiency.  This place has GOT to staff more bartenders and needs much more help.  Welcome to North Scottsdale Barcelona.
2,"Abridged:  Im gonna be real with you. I am not in love with Pizzeria Bianco, and had I actually had to wait in line, this rating would probably be lower. My group was lucky enough to receive the last table without any wait. Maybe it was the fact that its hard to impress me with pizza. Maybe it was a fluke that wont happen again. At least thats what everyone keeps telling me. But honestly, I just wasnt that impressed with the $19 pizza I received. Sadly, the leftovers I took home ended up being tossed because I was afraid to try it again.  Ive been worried about writing this for awhile (its been sitting here unfinished for nearly a year), but in the end, my opinions havent changed, and I sit here, still scared to return. If someone dragged me there again, or had a party there or something, Id probably give it another shot, as I hate to write off any place after a single trip, but I honestly felt just eh about the whole thing. Thankfully none of my visiting out of town guests have cried for me to take them there."
5,"Rivas helped me get through numerous late night study sessions and early morning hangovers!  Hard to go wrong with anything on the menu, but my two faves are the Carne Asada and Chile Rellano burritos...with fresh horchata, of course!"
4,"Recently a friend at the gallery was very excited because it was Dollar taco night a Chicos.  That is fine if you have any idea of where it is.  Turns out I had been by there more then a few times when I went to the Safeway and Subway at 7th st and McDowell.  Its a little place in a very small strip center.  Its very much a neighborhood place,  clean with an upbeat atmosphere and a few tables outside.  Thats about all I can say about the setting. I was surprised by the variety of meats that one can get on the tacos.  The tacos arent  to exciting but on the whole are fresh and have a good flavor better than I would have expected.  That is all I had but from what I saw of the meals around me, hey looked pretty good as a whole. I will go back to Chicos.  It definitely has fare that is better than the local fast food in the same price range.  Not an exciting place but pleasant to think of returning to.  I went there after a very long day so that is saying something.  Just the enjoyment of quite of the few people just sitting down and having a good time rubbed of on me.  I needed it!"
4,It was pretty good. But I dont know much about Indian food. It was better than the only other place Ive been too which had dirty grey chicken in its dishes. Taste was good.
5,I am a Regus member and could get wait here since I could use my membership card. Its a great place situated on 3rd floor with awesome city view.  Complimentary menu is refreshing. Cordial staff. Quiet and relaxed environment. Many TV screens and seatings to get comfortable with.
5,"2nd time I went to Grazie and both times it was excellent. The service is fast and attentive and the food great. The portions are huge so there is no problem to share the starter or the thin crust, wood-fired pizza ... So far I had the Dame Edna and the Roma pizza and both were very tasty. The wine collection is great and has some very interesting stuff which includes also less expensive wines. Havent made it to the desert menu yet as both times there was no space left ..."
5,"I am one step closer to completing my goal.  I want to visit every Grimaldis in the US before I die.  After tonights visit to this one, I have most of AZ taken care of. We decided to come here because we had never been to this one.  We arrived and were seated right away.  Surprisingly this one wasnt crowded at all and that was fine by us.   We got a small caesar salad, a small pepperoni and garlic, and a personal white pizza with roasted red peppers.  A few minutes later we got our salad.  It was really good.  Just enough dressing, lots of cheese and croutons.  It was a good starter.  A few minutes after that, our pizza came out.  If you have read my other reviews, you will know that I think Grimaldis is the best.....this pizza was no different.  I really liked the white with roasted red peppers.  Everything was delicious and even though there was some doubt we could finish off 2 pizzas, I turned on my inner fat boy, and finished off all the pizza.  It was tough, but someone had to do it....little kids are starving in Africa somewhere....lll be damned if Im going to waste some slices of this amazing pizza.  Down the hatch it went....my stomach doesnt like me right now because its so full, but he will forgive me once he doesnt get any of this delicatessen back in San Diego LOL."
3,"Mi Patio is a solid 3 star restaurant. Some days the food tastes better than others. And some days the entertainment value is better than others. But its not a chain, its within walking distance and has very affordable margaritas. Theres no bike rack (ugh) and the taquitos are basically a carne asada taco with no toppings (which I happen to like)."
4,"This place is great to go to for a chill and low key atmosphere. You can play billiards, cornhole, or video blackjack.  One thing I didnt like: one of the bartenders told me there is a $10 minimum to use my credit card and I think he was trying to hustle me because when I went back to close my tab (without buying another drink), the other bartender took my credit card. Otherwise, a nice chill place to go."
4,"Before a Suns game recently, my Family and I stopped into Blue Hound for some drinks and appetizers.  We attempted to go to Arrogant Butcher (been there many times), but it was packed.  Having heard good things from another family member, we decided to give Blue Hound a try, and Im glad we did.  The inside decor is trendy and simple.  We sat at the couch by the door (since that was what was available) and were quite comfortable - except for the occasional draft from the door.  Our waitress was ok, she wasnt entirely too friendly, but she took care of our needs. As for the food, we ordered pretty much all the appetizers.  The biggest highlight was the scones with bacon jam.  In fact, it was so good, its inspired me to make these two things at home to see if I can replicate it.  We also had the popcorn, which was good and the sliders, which were alright.  The pizza with duck was great (could have been crisper) as was the other items we had. Based on the previous reviews it seems this place, being new, might be hit or miss.  Id say give it a try if youre in the area... why not?  Trust me, its worth a visit for the cheddar scallion scones with bacon jam!"
3,"For cheap pizza, its as good as it gets. More selection than the other cheap pizza places, and the quality is way better.  The wings are delicious also, especially the Cajun flavor!!! If your looking for something like one of the big chains, then go there, but this is good for the money. If you want gourmet pizza, then go pay for it, dont look for it at the bargain places.  I paid $29 for an XL pizza with two toppings and 20 wings, and everyone was happy!  Just know that its really fast pizza, but its better than the other big guys!"
4,"Very consistent, thin crust pizza, made with fresh ingredients and excellent cheese! The market place is lively and the atmosphere is festive!"
3,"Its refreshing to find one-of-a-kind places -- God knows Phoenix needs more of them to inject personality into this generic, strip-mall, chains-on-every-corner valley. Finding this unique sandwich shop, which is in a house that has been transformed into a restaurant, is indeed a welcome find. The real estate is limited, so parking is compact and circles around the back of the building. The dining area is mainly indoors, but there is also a small patio facing the back portion of the parking lot, which is not very scenic. Inside there is art on the wall that can be purchased. They serve wraps, bowls and salads. The food has been pretty good, although it did not knock my socks off. I ordered the Baja Bowl, which is described on their online menu as ""Southwestern chicken atop garlic rice, black beans, Monterey jack cheese and topped with lime sour cream and pico de gallo."" It was OK, but the chicken was dry and cut in fairly large chunks. It could have possibly been microwaved -- not sure, but there were no southwest flavors to speak of. I have done a better job of cooking chicken on my George Foreman grill at home. Perhaps the garlic rice would have helped with the flavor, but I had substituted the rice with organic brown rice which did little to add flavor. Sour cream was not ""lime"". There was a small slice of lime served on the edge of the bowl. I would not bother ordering this again -- especially if I have a craving for some southwest food. On another recent visit I ordered a wrap called ""Prince of Thais - Spicy peanut chicken with baby spinach, garlic rice, fresh ginger slaw, cucumber pico and red onion wrapped in a spinach tortilla."" That had better flavor than the baja bowl. Vegetable ingredients were fresh and good. Again, I was not very impressed with the chicken chunks. One thing I think Thats A Wrap needs to address is the use of styrafoam cups. Afterall their slogan is ""Healthy Food for a Hungry Planet"" and they have a link for a new restaurant ""Green"" for Vegan food on their website. For such an artsy, earthy place, I would have thought Thats A Wrap would have made more conscious, earth-friendly choices. For that reason and the bland chicken, I give them an average rating only."
5,"Ritas Kitchen is a hidden gem located right smack in the center of the Camelback Inn. While this may be a hot-spot for hotel guests, I think that locals might be missing out on its charm.  I am a huge fan of anything the Camelback Inn does, especially since they offer live music and a great space for relaxation and Ritas Kitchen is no exception. This restaurant is airy and opens up to the spacious Camelback Inn patio where they play live music every night.  Breakfast:  Breakfast at Ritas is sublime and pretty reasonably priced. They offer a breakfast buffet for around $23 which includes eggs made to order (including omelets), pancakes, waffles, pastries, fresh fruit, bacon, sausage and hashbrowns. Its a great pick for a leisurely weekend breakfast. Just today was Mothers Day and while we only did the breakfast buffet, I did catch a glimpse of the Mothers Day brunch and holy moly do they know how to wow a crowd! Not only did they have stations set up all throughout the restaurant, patio and R-Bar, but they also had an extensive dessert area with build-your-own sundaes, freshly made cotton candy (in an old fashioned cotton candy maker) and a long dessert table with a chocolate fountain.  Lunch: Lunch here is sublime and I also enjoy either the tacos or the chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich is particularly a favorite of mine due to the cheese and sauce. The fries are tasty as well and you can either get sweet potato or regular. I also get sweet potato then regret not just getting the regular which are better in my mind. If the weather permits, sit on the patio and enjoy the beautiful water fountains, views of the mountain and tropical/desert setting."
1,"My husband and I heard great reviews about this restaurant and we decided to give them a shot. One word can describe this place GROSS!!! The food sounded great but then you took a bite and ewww disappointment. The salsa was lame, the chips stale. There were only two good things about this place the soda and the waitress was nice. Other than that dont waste your money GO TO ABUELOS...it may be on the west side but it never disappoints."
4,"I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this place. When I first saw the address, I was very skeptical. It is in Sunnyslope. I literally had to tell myself that there are still some gems on Central and that this place was probably one of them. Im so glad I had that talk with myself. This place is nestled into a great little area of shops and cute patio homes, small businesses and a school. They have a great atmosphere, the inside has roll-up, garage doors and there is a huge patio.  My friends and I settled into one of the sofa areas and made ourselves comfortable. They have a decent happy hour, all wines are 1/2 off and beer is $2.00 off. We ended up having some wine and a selection of brushetta, all was pretty yummy.  The brushetta wasnt the best I have ever had, but there was a nice selection and it was pretty tasty.  We had the brie and apples (delicious, how could you go wrong), mozzarella and tomatoe (also really yummy), brie and bacon which I didnt try and the tapenade (a little salty, but what can you expect from chopped up olives?).  Once happy hour ended, our very knowledgeable and helpful server told us that for $20 we could get a bottle of wine and another order of brushetta, so we did. Hey, why not, its Monday!?!  Ultimately, I was only supposed to stay for an hour (I was sick and jet-lagged and just needed to go home) and I ended up staying for almost four hours. As it got darker, the place took on a very sexy, relaxed vibe. I definitely like the place and I will be back.  Good atmosphere, good food, reasonable prices and friendly service."
5,Food is outstanding! Rebecca rocks!!!!!!
4,"What The Duce!? For starters, where the heck is this place? At first, I wasnt sure if I should be walking in simply because the factory workshop look threw me off!  Um ... hello?  No worries, once we walked into the store area thats when the fun started.  This place really got my interest.  Seems to me you can purchase some vintage items and clothes.  They had stadium-seating area with a projector screen, an ice cream shake area, boxing ring, and a small gym -- where the heck am I!    We finally found the restaurant area shortly.  The kitchen is an old school food truck, then again everything about this place is old school; chairs, tables, etc.  I ordered the sliders because it was a recommendation - meatball, chicken sausage, and bbq brisket.  A bottle of coke -- yep it figures.  Meatball sliders were the best of the 3, the sausage was definitely and acquired taste.   My sis, had the eggs and avocado one and it was okay.   I enjoy my visit to the Duce simply because of its odd ball nature.  Its definitely an experience wortha visit.  -  Enjoy!"
4,"Pleasantly surprised, great drink specials and cute outdoor seating. Food was really good and I look forward to going back!"
3,After our fav Mongolian place closed I was set on having Mongolian the night we came across AJs. It was decent.  It seemed a bit over priced.  The soft serve was kinda gross and the chocolate was out of order.  The all you can eat soup looked like it had been sitting there for a good 8 hours.  Will I go back? Maybe.  Was I impressed? Not really. Did I leave full? Yes.
5,"Excellent food! I do say the service isnt always the best, but the outcome of the food exceeds my expectations. Definitely recommend ordering the Artichoke Salad! Not what youd expect out of a typical boring salad! Not just stuffed with a large amount of dull, boring lettuce, but filled with spices and tons of flavor."
2,"So Ive been back to Ra a few times now, and while the food is always acceptable, the service has gotten progressively worse each time. Today my co-worker and I actually waited an unbelievable 50 minutes for our food, which - if your waitress stops by, checks in with you, apologizes, lets you know she knows youve been waiting - wouldnt have been nearly so bad. Still extremely annoying, sure, but forgiveable. Not this waitress - we had to call her over for every thing we needed. Serioulsy, not once did she just stop by to check on us. We had to call her over to place our drink order, ask for sugar for our tea, to place our food order, to get the check, everything. So by the time the food came, I had to scarf down my grilled apple teriyaki salmon brick in 5 minutes to make it back to work on time. Thats it, Ra - youve lost another customer."
4,"Good drinks, great food, and cool music. There is a stage right behind the bar. We tried the Fingerling Potatoes in Tomato Jam and it was fantastic.. I recommend."
4,"We just go there for lunch and its always very good.  I got a burger and a stella.  Both hit the spot.  Our bartender was spot on. Only complaint, please clean that crap up off the floor come on."
5,I had a mani/pedi and they did a wonderful job every time I visit.. The place is clean and the specialists are very nice..
4,"Feels a lot like Thats a Wrap (which used to be in this location).  I love the overhead door; I love fresh air.  Lots of seating and a bike rack (that doesnt really properly serve a lot of bikes, honestly). Food was very, very fresh.  I expected (per norm in most places) corners to be cut where not noticeable (see: frying something often masks its lack of freshness) - corners were not cut.  The three things ordered were all well prepared, fresh and delicious.  The things I oversaw on other tables were also looking mighty tasty. Id love to see a few bottles of craft beer here - thats my personal opinion.  Part of the issue is local laws, the other part is those running the show. Will return, for sure."
3,"A-OK is right and the hype is not always worth the wait. I will keep it simple since there are probably 500 reviews on the place. Pros: Great Hashbrowns, and made from scratch food Good specials to keep things mixed up Great company and service Cons: Guy up front says a little over 35 minutes but really means an hour and 45 minutes Pricey for some dishes Interesting people around while you wait to get inside (street walkers, etc.) the fresh squeezed orange juice is enough liquid to maybe fill up a double shot glass Overall I would love to give this place more stars if I could get in there without wanting to eat a finger due to starvation, and leave a bit more satisfied. Anyone who has eaten at Bryans in San Diego would know what I mean."
5,"Ive been a regular here the past 3 years. Other than the wait being long, the five spot sandwhich and waffle make this place one of my favorite in the nation."
3,Good destination for pizza. Would frequently go there for a slice at lunch when I worked in the area. Nice New York style pizza with a crisp crust.
5,Great Brisket. There has not been good BBQ in south Scottsdale for a long time. There is now!. The food is wonderful and priced well. Stop in and grab a bite.
5,This is my favorite pho joint in all of Arizona. I have been to about 17 from flagstaff to mesa to central and Tucson! The owners are so welcoming and very proud of their business and it shows! The place is always clean and the bathrooms are immaculate! I always order pho Tai and water.. But Ive had both their egg rolls and spring rolls both excellent! I love the broth! Its true pho broth.. Its not the beef bullion cubes other place use and you can defiantly taste the difference! The sprouts are the cleanest I have ever seen! I love this pho place ...  try the greatest pho in Arizona!
2,"Returned here after a years absense. I understand they have had a change in management. some for the better, some for the worse. new general manager and now the service seems much friendlyer and efficient. New chef and now food is slow to arrive and not as good as it used to be. steak was charred, mashed potatos were lukewarm. Took over 30 minutes for our food to arrive. hopefully it was just an off night for the kitchen. but the general feel was that they lost the attention to the little details"
5,"I have been attending Az Combat for the past 9 years and the instructors are fantastic. They teach Kickboxing, Jui-jitsu and MMA classes. Az Combat was one of the very first MMA Gyms in Arizona and have a great reputation as one of the top 10 training gyms in the nation. My daughter has also been at this school for the same amount of time and has taken advantage of many of the classes they offer including their boot camp. I would highly recommend this gym for beginners and the advanced  looking to break into the MMA circle. They have produced some of the top named fighters in Arizona."
1,"I would give this place NO STARS but Yelp! wants me to give at least one.  I went here with my boyfriend last night for dinner and next to our awful Bucca di Beppo (Scottsdale) experience, I have to say, this one is on my list of MOST TERRIBLE restaurant experiences. The service was so bad, we didnt even get to try the food!  True Yelper that I am, I did my homework before suggesting that we come here for dinner. I saw all the reviews about the ""bad service"" , but I paid more attention to the ""Cheap"" and  ""Delicious Pho"" reviews because after all, you cant knock it til youve tried it. Yes, the place looks as divey as any food dive gets, yes the place isnt as clean as it probably can be, but hey, all the best pho Ive  had (Da Vang, Khai Hoan, Pho Thanh) has been from some of the diviest pho spots in town.  I was excited.  It was around 6pm and the place wasnt busy (there were 5 other customers besides us, and 3 of them were on their way out), so we went ahead and sat ourselves down. The server gave us menus, and made her way back behind the cash register.  After looking over the menu for less than 2 minutes (I usually go for the spring rolls + everything pho whenever I visit a new spot), we were ready to order. I tried to make eye contact with our server but she seemed to be preoccupied with laughing and talking with the pre-teen sitting behind the counter with her. I finally made eye contact with her, she looked at me and I looked at her, and she turned back to her conversation. For the next 15 minutes I tried to get her attention to alert her that we were ready to order - no luck. But then I noticed that both her and the girl she was talking to were looking over at us and laughing, occasionally pointing in our direction and laughing some more. I wasnt about to give up because I was determined to try some of their well-reviewed food, but after a quarter of an hour spent trying to get their attention with them just laughing and pointing at us, my boyfriend and I had enough. The way they treated us was disrespectful and humiliating, so we walked out and drove across town to another Vietnamese restaurant.  We are never going back to this restaurant, and I suggest you dont either. Just as it isnt acceptable for customers to be rude to restaurant staff, it also isnt okay for restaurant staff to be blatantly rude to customers who have not done anything to deserve bad treatment. We did not deserve the type of treatment we got at this restaurant and I am seriously fuming with anger as I write this review. I dont care how delicious and cheap your food is, you cannot use that as an excuse to make customers who come in feel like somehow they are undeserving individuals.  Thanks, but no thanks, Pho House. I dont need to feel disrespected and belittled just so I can try your cheap Vietnamese food. I have plenty of Vietnamese friends who have moms who can probably cook better than you can and will treat us a million times better than your staff did last night."
3,"After hearing all of the hype on diners, drive in and dives and reading the yelp ratings, we decided to try it.  We waited over 30 minutes  for a table.  The place is small and outside of a dungy motel.  The service was extremely fast once you got in the door and the waitstaff are very friendly.  I had a waffle and it was good but nothing memorable.  My partner had an omelette with portguese sausage that he loved.  The hash browns were so buttery and they were good.   I wouldnt make a special trip back."
4,"Great ambiance, good food.  My husband and I had the Southwest Benedict and Eggs Benedict, both were delicious.  I do wish the eggs were a bit more runny and the food was warmer, but the presentation was beautiful."
4,"Im glad I made a second trip to Papago before writing a review, because they have redeemed themselves from my original visit. The problem with my first visit was two-fold: 1) The beers that were most interesting to me had run dry; 2) The food I ordered was pretty hard to grunt down. And although I sat at the bar with my compadre and tried to make conversation with the bartender about the different beers offered, it was fairly one-sided. I did not get a dose of craft beer expertise from what is arguably a brewpub that showcases a true love for beer. So regardless of the less-than-stellar first visit, I still was impressed with the selection of draft beer especially the regional offerings. The built-in beer coolers are also a testament to a great place to sample different labels. The one thing I must caution others against is the food. The steak sandwich I ordered (with special gardiniera) was pretty lousy. The beef had a precooked-then frozen-then reheated quality. The gardiniera was essentially all jalapeños and too fiery to eat... I had to scrape a fair amount of them off to make it edible. I had a good time drinking some decent beers with my friend, but we both regretted our food choice. My return visit restored my faith. The beer list was current and updated. There was a large variety of new draft beers to choose from, and my group ordered two pizzas. This place has delicious pizza! Our waiter was especially knowledgeable about the beers being offered and was able to help us choose especially interesting ones. I like the atmosphere and crowd at Papago and intend to return. But I will definitely stick to the pizza."
3,Its okay. its nothing like San Francisco food .
3,"A girlfriend and I have been meaning to check Bombay Spice out for a while but have never gotten around to it until last night. (I found a great deal on LocalDines.com -use ref # 102729 if you sign up! Also, checking in with FourSquare got a us a deal! )  We ended up going a little later (8ish) so there wasnt a wait or a crowd at all which was nice because the venue is a little smaller. The bartender was very friendly, our serve was a little distracted and took a little longer to respond to our needs but she was very nice. We both had wine, the ""single glass"" serving is actually 2 glasses in case you are torn between splitting a bottle for $20 or just buying a glass for $6.  I recommend the Falling Star Cab, it was full bodied and very yummy. The other wine we tried was the Hob Nob Pinot Noir. It was great, it had a delicious combination of earthy and sweet tones to it. (I am not very good with wine lingo, but those are my unofficial terms that make sense to me.) Neither of us were very hungry but we wanted to sample the fare so we could at least see if we wanted to come back. We got to choose either a free humus or a dessert because of my deal for checking in on FourSquare (POWER NERD! I know.) I really wanted to try the mango sorbet but we opted for the chickpea hummus and roti bread. For those of you, like me, who arent sure what roti bread is- its much lighter than pita bread and a little thinner than a tortilla. Its very tasty. The hummus was very good, and they garnished it with diced tomatoes, onions and cilantro which i loved! We also ordered the seared eggplant. It was AWESOME. It was a large slab of eggplant with a black sauce that was herby (thats a technical term in case you were wondering). They also served the egglplant with a yellow sauce drizzled on the plate which was sweet and very good, in addition to a small scoop of a red chili sauce (our waitress told me the name and I couldnt remember it for the life of me) which was spicy...I really loved this sauce it was the perfect amount of spice for the eggplant.  I will be going back here to try the curry and some of the other things on the menu i cant pronounce.  There are a LOT of vegetarian/vegan dishes clearly marked on the menu. Their menu also boasts that everything, except for 9 or 10 items, is completely Gluten free. Good experience, definitely looking forward to trying it again for a full meal."
4,"Very fun atmosphere and really good tasting food. Portions were large but not overwhelming so. Banana walnut pancakes were fragrant, tasty, light, and just the right balance between salty and sweet. Eggs Benedict was also very very good.  Definitely a place to frequent often as long as you dont mind a line, counter ordering, and finding a place to sit without a hostess."
4,"Good food, good drinks, fun bar. There are quite a few Buffalo Wild Wings in the valley and theyre a fun place to grab a quick lunch or dinner and watch the game.   They have a pretty good garden burger and their buffalo chips (french fry-ish things) are really good.  If you like bloody marys, they have the best one. Its so good...really spicy and filled with celery and olives.  Be careful when you come though, if there is a game on, youll have to get there early or you definitely wont get a spot to sit."
4,"Very good Rubios, very accommodating for my diet needs and the kids love their taquitos.  It is in a convenient location when you are shopping and dont have time to go home.  The management seems to be on top of things and keep the place very clean."
5,"Mmm dirty hipster bars.  Let me count the ways in which I love you. You are cheap (we had $2 Stellas) You are interesting (local art on the walls that Im told changes regularly) You are full of pretension (people watching is always worth the price of admission) You are friendly (like minded souls can smell each other out) If you are in the Roosevelt district, I highly recommend stopping in for happy hour.  Its cheap and hipstery.  Both words have been used to describe me, so I am naturally predisposed to this place."
3,"We were still on a search for New Mexican food and I read up on this place and it was also recommended by a friend.  It was average, not very New Mexican.  I tried the pecan grilled shrimp tacos and they were good! My boyfriend got the stacked enchiladas which was just ok.  Still on the hunt for good New Mexican food in AZ."
3,"Came for dinner with a friend with the $2 off coupon. The service was attentive, friendly, and overall excellent. The english conversation is less than stellar but the fact they took off $2 from both of our meals more than makes up for it. Still a little pricey for two gals with small appetites but not bad. Pani poori, naan, mango lassi, hot chai tea, tikka masala, paneer makani, lamb curry, and many other options available. I would avoid the gross spaghetti noodle option and awkward as it sounds mango flavored other fruit custard.  Overall a good experience. My favorite part is that the separators still have bears from when it was a black bear diner!"
5,"When I first stepped into Smeeks, my entire face lit up, I was figuratively (and quite literally) ""a kid in a candy store.""  Its is a true one of a kind store, its so entertaining to just walk around in. The decor is fun, the inventory is even more fun, and the photo booth is by far the most fun! The walls are full of great novelty items, such as the Smoking Baby (that actually smokes!), Yodeling Pickle (that actually yodels!), and Fake Cigarettes that are surprisingly realistic! Plus, Smeeks has a lot of really cool, and delicious candy. My personal favorite was the Fat Pig organic chocolate bar (with Puntini coming in a close second).  Smeeks is most definitely my new favorite store in CenPho!"
4,"This place is so cute.  To begin, it is trendy but comfortable.  The service is fantastic and the food is really good.  We were a party of six, and ordered a few appetizers (the deviled eggs were good) and for lunch, many of us did half flatbread/half salad..for a reasonable $10.  Mine was delicious.   I had a blueberry salad which was really tasty, and my margherita pizza was great.  The sun-dried tomatoes were perfect.  I will be back for sure when Im up for drinks....a wee bit early for drinks today as we ate at 11:15."
4,"Ive been here a couple times and from reading other reviews, I must have come on a good night!  Both times I was here we sat on the patio and really enjoyed the atmosphere.  They have a large rock pit? in the middle that they light when its cold for heat.   I really love the mussels in the white sauce here and last time I also had the spinach salad.  It was delicious!  Fresh and served with the perfect amount of bacon vinaigrette. The service is good, nothing special - but what is with the waitresses wearing flip flops?  I just dont see how that is sanitary especially if theyre walking in the kitchen.   Overall it was good and Im sure Ill be back.  I keep meaning to come for happy hour when they have 1/2 price appetizers!  A bowl of mussels and a glass of Sauvignon Blanc is all I need for an inexpensive and tasty dinner."
3,"Dont go to Dos for authentic Mexican food or stellar service, youll be disappointed.  Go to Dos for a fun atmosphere, good Happy hour and cheap ""bar"" food... then youll be pleased!  Dos usually hits the spot after a hot day at the baseball game or for a first stop before a night out on the town.  It has all the essentials, food, ATM, toilets and a huge selection of booze!"
2,"This place is more miss than hit, I stop by here for breakfast on rare occasions and the food usually comes out more than slightly mangled.   The food is usually edible and the customer service at the window is always friendly.  Ive never had the experiences that Phoenician C has but I will admit that this can be one of the lower end McDs that Ive been to in this town. Curse you McGriddle!!!"
5,"After flying across the country we were hungry and as Ive done in many other cities, I went in search of pho.   I ordered the pho dac biet.  The broth was not oily, and packed with flavor.  The noodles were just right and there was a generous amount of tripe and tendon."
5,"Still my most favorite hot dog ever and I think the magic is in the presentation. Theyve got the best hot dog sleeve. It perfectly holds the dog, lots of chili and its not messy. Another must have is a Cherry Lime Squeeze; Sprite, Cherry flavor, squeezed limes and maraschino cherries."
4,"It was almost impossible for me not to stop here on the cab ride back from old town for carne asada fries.mmmm sooo good! I really only went there between the hours of 2-4am but, los betos never let me down."
4,Ive been here many many times and have never had a bad time. Everything has always been up to par. I literally have no complaints. AND - I recently dropped a personal check made out to me while getting cash out to pay my bill. The manager found it and mailed it back to my client. Talk about honest service.  BJs is our go to place for an easy weekend lunch. Their home brewed root beer is super good.
4,"I love this place!!! Lots of space and cheap, TASTY Mexican food. Not much more than that needs to be said."
1,"No.   If you ask me about eating at Papaya Thai, that is what I will say.  0 stars for the single kinda scattered and scruffy staffperson.   0 stars for the cook who cannot prepare an offering from the menu as the menu describes it. In this case, I was down to two remaining untried Thai restaurants within quick reach of the Valley Metro Limo, and both in Tempe.  The other half was in Tampa, and since he does not care much for Thai, I get the chance to try one.   The limo arrived at Southern and Mill at 5:17 PM, and connected me with another limo at Broadway. With traffic, getting to McClintock took nearly 15 minutes.  On exiting the limo, 5:50 PM, I walked back about half a block to the restaurant. On entering the restaurant, I picked up a menu and rang the bell and a somewhat harried staff person came to greet me.  He asked me where I wanted to sit, at a table with 1 bench looking directly into the side of a huge fish tank...or the next table, which would leave no buffer between myself and the only other table seated in the restaurant.   There are at least 120 seats in this restaurant.  Why so fiercely contain people in the first three tables close to the door?  You must get your business in fits and hurries and keeping only the 3 tables active is working for you?  Then again, your telling me you are the only staffperson does not surprise me.  The Help Wanted sign on the door was more than an indication that Help is NEEDED! When I was seated, staffperson offered to bring water.  The phone rang and he was off, as he offered another version of ""I am the only staffperson here...""  I looked at the menu and made my decision. In the menu, there is a $2 charge listed for sharing.  This goes against everything Thai I have ever known.  The traditional Thai meal has everyone enjoying some of each dish served.  Because of my proximity to the fish tank, I was quite up close and personal with the fish. The water probably isnt filthy, but the plexiglass tank is not helping the perception.  6 PM, as the cellphone chime reminds me of the passing of an hour.  I am waiting for water and a staffperson who can take my order. 6:01, the staffperson comes, bearing a pitcher of water and a (My eyes are rolling in opposite directions because I am either overworked or stoned) smile.  He filled up my glass and asked if I was ready to order.  I replied that I was and ordered Som Tom, the Thai name for the green papaya salad. Staffperson replied that he did not know the Thai names for the menu items.  The phone rang again. Staffpersons attention was no longer on me.  The phone, his Pavlovian stimuli, had taken him away.  I asked if he had heard me.  He replied that he needed to go answer the phone.  He asked if I minded waiting, as he was the only staffperson.  I said I would wait.  Off he went, in pursuit of electronic interaction.   6:10 PM, staffperson returns, apologizing for the telephone delay and asking about my order.  I ordered the papaya salad without the green beans and steamed rice on the side.  Staffperson took the order and went to the kitchen.  The phone rang as he left the table,  his pace quickening as he approached the phone.   6:18 PM, the door opens and 2 potential patrons enter.  The bell rings and staffperson rushes to the waitstand to greet 2 new patrons.   6:20 PM, staffperson returns. He brings the salad and a bowl of rice.  The salad that appears has some of the traditional salad ingredients along with ingredients that have no business being in the salad.  Som Tom does not have cucumber, shredded lettuce or cilantro.  On sending back the initial preparation, staffperson returned with the original preparation, advising the chef stated ""This is a traditional Thai presentation of the dish"".  I sent the order back, citing the inconsistencies and asking for a new presentation. 6:25 pm.  As I empty my water glass, the salad I received previously is returned, minus the cucumber.  In asking staffperson if this is a new presentation or if it is an attempt to correct the original, he replied that he did not know.  I stood and left.  While the advertisement on the window of the establishment says they have ""The Best Curry in the Valley"",   they will get no second chance to prove it to me.  For all the phone activity, there was no one who came to pick up a carry-out order.  Between this and the somewhat glazed staffperson, I have to wonder if this place is not a front for a drug business."
4,Excellent service. Thankyou Denise! Food was excellent...the two of us shared the C4 salad and a custom and pizza with a cappuccino and a latte.  Everything was very good and the portions big!
4,"Upon our overnight stay at Econolodge a few blocks down, the live lit sign along side of the street attracted me to try this restaurant.  I remember the menu vaguely, however did not forget the amazing breakfast special the other half and I ordered.  $6 for a plate of thick cut bacon, 2 eggs made your way, hash browns, and toast (white/wheat/rye, etc.)  Customer service was great, the hostess and waitress made us feel very comfortable!"
5,"Any parent with young children can vouch for me on this one...keeping the attention of a three year old is, to say the least, difficult. They need constant stimulation, otherwise, there very well may be hell to pay! Enter, the Childrens Museum of Phoenix! The facility is an old school, converted into three stories of pure fun and energy!  After you pay your standard $11/person older than 1 (or your $22 for up to four people with a Groupon), you encounter a three story art project that can only be described as AWESOME! There are multiple ways in which your children can traverse this mammoth. The various pathways challenge children in strength, balance, and critical thinking skills...all of the ways you want to challenge your child! After your child has lost interest in this room, you progress to the second floor. Here, children get to experiment with a really cool board that can only be described as ""Plinko-esque"". Here, children can alter the path of a falling object by changing different platforms. My daughter thought I was a genius because I was able to predict where her object would land every time...its a shame shell ultimately realize how routine that feat really is.   After Plinko, children can either go to the trike wash, build forts, or they can head to the art room. After some laps through the wash, my daughter wanted to head into the art room. Being that we went right before Halloween, our child had the opportunity to make black play dough (to make spiders), she got to paint on a giant rocket ship, and then she was able to make a spooky tree out of a brown paper bag. Such simple activities...such great opportunities! After cleaning all of the paint from her smock, we made the journey up...to the third floor. Here, children get to play grown-ups. Theres a mock supermarket that allows children to either shop, ring up merchandise, or work in the stock room of a miniature grocery store. After shopping, our daughter wanted to work at the little ice cream stand located just outside of the grocery. We had fake ice cream cones and sat at the tiny bistro set while we watched children make their way through the noodle forest. We then made our way to the end of the hall to race miniature race cars on roller skate wheels. Being only three floors, our day at the museum only lasted a couple of hours...but in those short hours, my daughter never stopped smiling! How on earth could you rate any place less than five stars when it brings so much joy to YOUR pride and joy?"
4,Fancy ladies with a few gays sprinkled in. This is NM Cafe! Popovers. Prawn and avocado salad. Glass of Sauvignon Blanc. Make your reservation under Candy Spellings name. You will get the BEST table.  Works every time.
5,"If you are looking for TLC in very unique pet products and family style customer service, Posh Pet Boutique and spaW is where you need to go. They have retailed my collection of Decadent Digs there for going on 3 years, since the first day she opened her doors. I have seen her business blossom and become the destination and extra sunshine of the Troon Area. Her loving warmth (sort of Doris Day way) makes you feel like you are in her home and makes want you to come back often. She carries a huge collection of class act merchandise from cute clothes to a killer Kitty high-rise and offers excellent grooming. She is worth the trip."
5,"If you are writing poor reviews you obviously have not eaten Susies Chile Verde con Carne.   I dream about it.  And I grew up in New Mexico!  The best  bowl of green chili stew or even better the green enchiladas with melt-in-your-mouth beef anywhere in town.  #13...dont forget the sour cream.    So you with the 2 & 3 stars go back and try the green chili and watch your stars become shooting stars!  Ive never tried anything else there.  Why would you when youve found green chili heaven? Man, just talking about it makes me drool.  Im headed out the door.....Susies here I come!"
3,"The owner of Vermont Sandwich Co. just contacted me and offered to make right what happened to me during my last visit.  Nice gesture but I had to decline.  I didnt write what I did for a handout but Im giving this place one more star for the offer. Vermont Sandwich Co is very highly rated.  For the owner to try to make right by one negative commenter among a multitude of positive, says something about the owners integrity. I think a return visit to Vermont Sandwich Co. may be in order..."
4,"I love the ambiance at Joes Farm Grill.  Its great to grab your food and sit outside at one of the many picnic tables.  Stopping there with the dogs after an afternoon at Cosmo Dog Park is a must!  There is something for everyone on the menu, from gourmet burgers (all I have to say is fontina! Yum!) to pizza, to ribs. Its also a great place to take out-of-state guests who just blew into town from one of those cold climates.  They are usually psyched to be sitting outside enjoying a meal during the winter without having a propane heater involved.   Make sure you go for a walk on the grounds too.  Its very relaxing and a great way to work off a few calories!"
3,"I dont know why it is that all these airports have such a major lack of seating.  The staff here are friendly, and security is quick, but I just wish theyd work on the gate areas and add more seats.  Need an example?  Sacramento Internationals new terminal."
4,"This is by far my hubbys favorite lake for bass fishing.  I am not a fan of waking up at 4am in the morning to get there by 5am...not for fishing.  Yes, that is all my boys do here. It gets really packed on the weekends by 9am.   When the water is low, it is not easily accesible from the picnic spots.  It also gets super windy, enough to go windsurfing (too bad its a long treck for us).   You really have to have a boat to enjoy this lake.  The absence of shade trees make the heat uncomfortable in the middle of summer, you might as well go to Canyon or Saguaro (my faves). I love the sharp edged cliffs juxtaposed against the crystal clear water.  Good photo ops. Why the 4 stars?  Like I said, my hubby loves fishing here for the bass.  For some reason, little bluegills like me.  I also like the floating porta-john and porta-jane...weird, but cool!  Whoever does the draining has a crappy job. All in all, it is a nice big lake and by far one of the cleanest too."
5,"This is a great little authentic Mexican restaurant - dont let the looks fool you, it is delicious!  I had the Tampiquena, it is one of the best I have had.  Highly recommended"
5,"Clean, organized, and well-stocked (for the most part), Fujiyas carries my favorite car freshener, chips, bread, and iced coffee (in a can) among many other good things. Reasonably priced and extremely courteous customer service, I am always happy to shop there. The bentos, I wish, are kept in warmers like Suruki in San Mateo, CA, but Fujiya has an area adjacent to the register which includes a microwave to heat your purchased bento, so you can sit and eat and relax after shopping. What I love so much about their service is that I can place my order ahead of time and theyll have it available and ready. I think this is the only Japanese store that has just about everything I need to stock my pantry. Its no wonder Ive been coming here year after year."
3,"Service was fast and friendly, the mixed drinks are great!  We went on a busy Friday night and a lot of familys where there.  They have a man walking around making balloon figures.  The slide/ stairs is a great touch for kids.  The food was OK, nothing outstanding. The view was amazing, it overlooks the entire city."
3,"Excellent food, top-notch service, exorbitantly priced.  Not for budget minded diners..."
4,"My friend and I decided to try this place for happy hour around lunchtime since its such a short walk from ASU.  I ordered a glass of the crossing, which was tangy, and a little on the dry side with a fruity aroma.  Going off of a college students budget, we shared a plate of the bruschetta which was a bit pricey for 4 slices of baguette with toppings, but delicious nonetheless. Pulled pork and salmon were my two favorite! The atmosphere is great and its always lively and full of people- plus its a great location."
4,"I love the Penang Curry at the Thai House! Better than any other place Ive had. Too, the lunch special is one of the best deals in town. The spring rolls are pretty good, although Im not crazy about the sauce, its a bit too thick and sticky for my liking. The service is okay, during lunch they could use additional help, servers are literally jogging to service their tables. Overall, its a great spot - Im definitely eating there a few times a month if not more."
3,"Bad service, great food, awful coffee."
1,"The food is delicious.  The service:  discriminatory.  The bartender, blonde gentlemen, went around to everyone else, then finally acknowledge us.  This is embarrassing, I dont know what else to say."
5,"Delicious yet again! Pho, garlic green beans, papaya salad...they can do no dish wrong. The owner, Justina, is hip, cool, gorgeous and awesome! Its BYOB so bring a nice wine or beer...no corking fee so dont forget to tip well! If youre eating and theres a big line of others waiting, please do what we do and go across the street to gelato so that other people dont have to wait an hour."
5,Amazing food. Great date night place with an impressive wine list.  Definitely come her again and more often.
1,Experience with Hostess was rude. Service with a frown. Our waiter had attitude too. It was a birthday dinner and we were in great spirits..so this review is written with clarity. The margaritas were strong-check ok there. The shrimp appetizer was different and very good and $18 for four shrimp. We ordered two mahi mahi dinners (each $24)and they were RANCID. Yup. I said RANCID. We asked if the shrimp fajitas dinner had the same jumbo and they said they would have to charge extra (each entree was priced at $30) we had to pay extra for the beans and rice that they had left on the table-which was cold by the time the shrimp dinner--which came with 5 shrimp and onions.  Poor service with an attitude. Mediocre food to say the least...all over-priced. Never going back.
3,"I am an avid quilter and moved here recently. I am on the hunt for a new quilt shop and I went here, despite the ""grandma quilt shop"" name lol. The staff was VERY nice and helpful and friendly. The shop a little on the small side, which made me surprised to find that they have a very decent selection of contemporary fabrics! My only disappointment is that that they dont have fat quarters cut of each of the fabrics, though they will cut fat quarters - but thats not something I want to have to wait around for.  They carry a small selection of minky and home dec fabrics as well. I will definitely be back there!"
5,"When Im casual but want to feel NYC I go to Christophers.  We go here for a special occasion dinner or on the fly happy hour...which is the best HH food in town!  Let me repeat that - best in town!!!   Hamburger with truffle fries, brick oven pizza or a perfect salmon salad plus a beer or glass of wine for about $10/person. Cant beat it!  Sitting at the open kitchen makes me appreciate the setup and organization required to run a restaurant as well as the chefs tatts!?  If you dont want the blaring heat of the brick oven, dont sit at the corner next to it...Phoenix is HOT enough in the summer, so cool off and let someone else do the cooking!"
4,"I gave an extra star just because it is so fun to hang out here.  The waitresses are always cute and friendly and not afraid to pour your drink.  Alot of my friends are in love with the food here, I have to disagree. I think good but not great.  Still this place gets the nod from me just because it is so fun to hang out.  Chances are you will meet some new friends there too."
2,"I went because several people I know raved about the place, because Im a lapsed vegetarian and Im always trying to get back on track and heard the veggie sandwiches were incredible, and because Im a malt freak and found out they have malteds there. I was disappointed. And my friend I was with who had been one of Sticklers die-hard fans said that, although it was okay this time, the place seems to have gone down hill. Sticklers wasnt busy at all, maybe 4 tables of customers and 3 people in line, but although there were alot of workers behind the counter, the service was very slow. We had to wait a long time for our veggie sandwiches. Now my friend has been there when it was jam-packed and she said the service then was much quicker. We went about 2 so maybe the staff was worn out from the lunch rush earlier. The bread was good, crunchy on the outside and soft inside but the vegetarian sandwich itself was boring. Its supposed to have Swiss, Provolone and American cheese on it. I couldnt even taste the Swiss or Provolone at all, the American over powered the sandwich and was more like a cheez-whiz type. Im always on the look out for a good malt, one that really tastes like a malt and not a shake. My chocolate malt tasted more like a shake and I wasnt impressed with the ice cream. My buddy liked her vanilla malt though. The one thing I did like about Sticklers is that they have the small bags of Miss Vickies chips to buy. It used to be you could buy big bags in the grocery stores but now the chips,which are the best kettle chips Ive ever had, are just carried in certain deli and sandwich shops."
3,"Big fan of their SW Chicken Caesar salad and fire roasted tomato soup. My favorite sandwiches are the chicken panini, the turkey cranberry, and the teriyakki chicken wrap. I love both wildflower and Paradise but Paradise Bakery has the best cookies. And although I do not get it very often because its a killer in calories, the chocolate cheesecake brownie is to die for!"
4,"Grab a cup, grab an outdoor chair, enjoy the show!"
4,"This is a new neighborhood breakfast joint in a building many think is ""cursed"".  The turnover for businesses at this location is high.  But I think Oink is going to make it!  They were very busy when we were there so it took a little bit to get refills on coffee (need bigger cups) and the food took a couple minutes longer, but no worries.  Who I think is the owner was not just standing by and watching everyone else run around like chickens with their heads cut off, they were serving, clearing plates, filling coffee.  Love to see that!   The menu is decent.  Im not a huge breakfast person but there were quite a few items on the menu I was interested in.  The funny thing is my hubby and I ended up not ordering any bacon and didnt realize this until after we finished eating!  So we definitely will be going back to try the bacon they are known for....jalapeno bacon anyone!"
5,"I hardly ever get past their carne adovada. Its simply amazing. Add a couple of extra homemade tortillas to it? Cant be beat! I have had their pecan crusted sea bass also, along with lamb chops (chipotle?) both very, very good. Great atmosphere, friendly, competent staff...a winning combination. Get there early! Long waits after 6:00pm!!"
5,"I heart Romes Pizza!! Being a native New Yorker, I have struggled over the past two years to find anything remotely close to NY style pizza. I had tried many local, independent places, but no one got it right.  When I moved back to Scottsdale about 6 months ago my guy and I passed this place driving down McDowell road. I figured we could try it out (Im always on the look out for some yummy pizza). Dont be taken back by the empty parking lot and shabby exterior, after all, isnt it whats inside that counts??  The food is always fresh. The Greek salad is great - it comes in small and large. The pizza is amazing (as long as you know what youre getting - NY style). I know that its family owned, which I always have an appreciation for.  The man that owns it does most of the deliveries. When I first moved to the area I called for delivery and he had to call me because he couldnt find my street. Embarrassingly, I only knew the street I lived on and not much more, so I couldnt help him. He told me that it was okay and eventually found the house.  I expected him to get out of the car and give me a huge attitude, thinking Im an idiot because I didnt know where I lived (could you really blame him?). But he was as sweet as could be and told me it was no problem. How refreshing!  In a nutshell, hoooorray for Romes!!"
5,"I have been trying to get into a consistent workout routine for years... Ive tried it all! gym memberships, pilates, training for a marathon but was never able to stick with anything... until Karve that is! My husband found it for me on here actually and thought I should try it (not sure what he was trying to hint at with that... but i love my improved Karve body too much now to care :) Anyway, I went and am now hooked! it is the greatest work out ever - its hard but the results happen so quickly that its motivating... and its really the only workout routine that Ive ever been able to stick with ever!  and with going multiple times a week I found that it even changed my appetite - I no longer feel annoying cravings so eating healthier is easier for me (a former carb/chocolate fiend) It really helped me finally get into a more active/healthy lifestyle - I know that sounds so cliche but Im still shocked everyday that a lazyass/sweets-eating like me is actually working out on a regular basis - and its all bc of the great method of Karve.... plus the instructors are SO sweet and nice/friendly and supportive Im honestly making friends there... all in all a stellar review for Karve Studio!! im a believer :)"
4,I was very happy with the food and service. The service was wonderful and quick too.
2,"Nah. I forked over $13 for a club sandwich, mac n cheese, and a large Pepsi.  The mac n cheese was good, and the sandwich was just okay.  I say take your $13 and go to Texaz Grill!!!  WAY better food, and for $13 you can get dessert too."
4,"Good little place in old town across from Cowboy Ciao. Had the turkey apple swiss wrap w/ dried cranberries,local greens, smoked bacon, and cashews. Very good and great size. The lady had the grilled chicken & sage pesto sandwich w/ goat cheese, gala apple, and smoked bacon. She liked it as well. The sweet potato chips were very good too. will be back for sure."
5,"St. Francis gives the impression you could be dining in one of the finest cities in the world, instead of the 5th largest cities in the USA. Start with their cucumber gin drink, and then order another.  Goat cheese on crostini follows.  Insist on extremely memorable whipped potatoes--a side order-- to accompany your salmon on red quinoa.  Dessert MUST be the chocolate cake with peanut butter gelato accompanied by carmel sauce trailings and carmel corn garnishes. Try dining at the bar for an uncluttered view out the picture window opening, minus the glass. Loved it!  Will happily return. They split our entree for us AND were gracious about the extra trouble we caused--not a wimper.  Truly superior service !"
5,"Unfortunately I dont get enough chances to come here but, Id say I have been here about a dozen times and each time I have never been let down.  The beer is great, the food is great, especially their french fries and the crowd is OK.  Yes it is in Tempe and youre stuck with all the ASU kids but I like to come here in the summer time or when ASU is on break because it is the locals that are here.  It is not the nicest brewery that I have ever been to, but what they lack in aesthetics they make up for in beer.  A must go to place if youre in the Tempe area!"
3,"Yes I am writing a review about Red Lobster, dont judge me!! You all know you love those little cheddar biscuits more then life itself!  Seriously, Those biscuits, good lord!  Hubs and I went here last night, his picking. He loves him some Ultimate Feast. I usually stick to the coconut shrimp.  Our waitress was awesome, the place was packed to the gills but we never really had to wait for refills. She did forget to put in for the beer hubs ordered, but he lived (YAY)!  The food comes out hot and fast.  We also got an appetizer, did the ""pick two"" the mozzarella sticks were surprisingly good and the calamari wasnt just fried calamari but it came with fried broccoli and red peppers as well, super tasty!"
5,"I always buy my tires at Walmart, but they didnt have a tire to fit my car. They directed me to Discount Tire and told me that they actually have better pricing. I went to this location and had the best experience. They were very helpful, saved me money, and I was in and out in under 25 mins. I will be back again and again!!!!"
1,"Can someone please tell me why people go here??? Went to breakfast with Deb L, and she had a Living Social deal or one of those deal thingies. The place was packed, probably because its a holiday week. That doesnt excuse the EXTREMELY poor service. We sat down and waited. And waited. Servers walked by every few moments, nobody stopped to fill our water glasses or take our order. Finally, we both said something to a girl who walked by. She seems mystified that there was a job to do. With that many people working, getting a cup of coffee shouldnt take 15 minutes. Yes. 15 freaking minutes. Food? Mediocre at best. I got the traditional eggs benedict with home fries. The only saving grace with the amount of ham on it. The English muffin didnt seem to be toasted. The eggs were *ok* but nothing great. The home fries? My 9-year old niece could do a better job. My burps right now arent even good enough to brag about. Im sure if the service had been better, I wouldnt be so miserable right now. My food coma isnt satisfying. I will *never* go here again. Ever. I felt stupid leaving a tip, it was THAT bad.  Total. Fail. Blech."
4,"Kale, miso, shrimp dumplings... all good"
4,YUM! The flavors were great! Oatmeal cookie and caramel apple were great and tasted just like the real thing. The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 is because some of the toppings such as the twinkies and baklava were whole pieces and I wish I could have just grabbed pieces of them instead of a whole one...toppings like those could add a lot of $$ very quickly so I skipped those ones.
5,DUDE..where is the manga....where are the card tables. .....What the heck is this place doing selling comics! This is outrageous!  And why are you talking to me and trying to help me comic clerk! Your job is to give me a huge sigh and exasperated look as if I asked you to perform surgery. This being helpful and friendly is really bothering me. You guys are just too weird. I need to go back to Atomic.
2,"I cannot stand this mall. They have some really awesome stores but the people who work in them are obnoxious. Most of the people walking around are snooty as can be, and everything is overpriced. The food court has some good selection, but is always super crowded and you can rarely find anywhere to sit. Parking is awful."
2,"Absolutely, positively bitter. They use a powder in lieu of syrups which adds a after taste I dont care for. There was no color difference between my beverage (latte) and my friends (iced coffee). Why... I have no clue. We order these drinks everywhere and this has never happened before. I can see how a powder would be more cost effective but the taste was something I did not care for. Maybe that makes me a coffee snob, I am not sure."
4,"Maybe closer to 3.5 but I am rounding up because Im not opposed to being won over by ""smart"" bartenders -- when I ordered drinks she asked to see my ID and then followed it with, ""you look so young, you must get that often."" Granted, she looked younger than me, but I am not opposed to having my reviews swayed by cute bartenders who know the right buttons to push. In addition, the house margarita was good, and I have been known to throw bad margaritas all over the bar in a fit of rage when I dont get carded...fortunately my vanity was satisfied.  The space is very nice and open, and despite the decent size crowd, it didnt feel crowded. Our wait was less than 20 minutes and there is ample place to sit and have a drink while you wait. Now, I must say, I dont know that the required staff uniform is unattractive, but it does seem like an impromptu tennis match could break out any moment.  The braised short rib enchiladas were good and the fish tacos were even better. The tacos were slightly overstuffed and rather difficult to eat as a result, but the taste was good (3 shells, as opposed to 2, with the same amount of taco insides would be better).  While the waitress didnt attempt to win me over with flattery, the service was prompt and attentive."
2,"Took almost 45 mins for a oil change (they told me 20 mins when I got there) and it cost something like that as well...  Slow and expensive, not 2 things I like associated with my lube jobs."
5,I love this place! Great place to grab a quick smoothie or stay to hang out! (just let them know if youre in a  hurry) P.S. The phone number is area code 480 not 490 :)
4,"Couple things.  First, I am reviewing a Delivery order that I placed.  (If you didnt know that they delivered... Now you do!) You start by looking at their website, which is modest.  Its a black background with White text.  Pretty much all of their food is available for take-out, except for the alcohol. *TIP* Make sure to look at their PDF Menu.  It has TONS of more choices than what is listed on their Website.  I wasnt even aware of this fact until I had ordered my food. At this point, they do not have online ordering set up, so you call and place your order that way. Cornish Pastys (pronounced Pastie, not Pastey) are amazingly delicious.  They take whatever filling you choose (from the Chicken Alfredo to the Bangers and Mash), and they place it in a thin, crisp dough that surrounds it.  Think of a Calzone, except the Irish version. Now, these are very, very filling.  They are modestly priced (all of them are less than $10), and they are EXTREMELY DELICIOUS. Make sure you give them a try.  I will sure be eating here again!"
5,Just moved to AZ and this is my local Petco. Everyones really helpful and friendly. We just took our dogs here to get groomed and they came back smelling fresh and looking clean.
3,"3 stars is being generous. Went to Tesoro tonight with my husband and two teenagers based on the glowing yelp reviews.  It is a very small restaurant, 9 - 10 tables with a small waiting area out in front, facing the strip mall parking lot.  We had a reservation for 7:30.  Arrived on time and were apologetically told that our table was not yet ready.   Had to wait out front for 20 minutes shivering. After we were seated, drink, wine, and appetizer orders taken, we relaxed and began to settle in.  Problem was, it is a very loud room. Conversation was a challenge.  Looking around, we realized that we were the youngest table in the room.  Average age appeared to be 60+ years old. Oh, well, young and hip it is not.  Hopefully the food is good. Bruschetta and antipasto were tasty.  For entrees, we ordered the homemade Fettuccine Bolognese, Spaghetti al Pomodoro, the Chicken Saltimbocca and a special, Farfalle with shrimp and asparagus.  Flavors were good, not great, but none of the pasta was homemade.  Very much a disappointment. On the upside, service was very attentive and friendly.  Unfortunately, food is only mediocre, and the strip mall location is a definite detraction in size and ambiance.  Would I return again?  No."
5,"When people feel a cold coming, they pop a zinc lozenge or tablet to boost the immune system. I have a much better way to get my zinc supplementation: I head over to Pier 83 for their terrific fried oysters. With the first crunchy bite I begin to feel so much better. Placebo effect, probably. But hey ... as long as I get that feel-good boost, I dont care. The fish and chips are also the best Ive had in the Valley. And to think that Ive previously been trying to get my fish n chips fix from the likes of Petes ... yikes! And their clam chowder is delicious; I dont need to feel under the weather to have an excuse for ordering this tasty bowl of comfort. The friendly staff and comfortable informal atmosphere complete the enticement for many return visits."
4,"Very good coffee!  I get my iced Americano here with room for cream.  The coffee is so much better than the Starbucks down the street, but not as convenient...shamefully to say, theres no drive-through.  When you have a vehicle full of kids which one would you pick?  So, I come here solo right before I wander around the little shops.  A must try!"
4,We ate there last night and were very pleased our meals and service.  The ribs were especially good.  We would go back again.
4,"I just moved to AZ from Honolulu with my bf and found this to be a great breakfast / brunch place. They do close at 2:30pm. On my last visit, I ordered the amazing ""2 for you""! You get the choice of a half sandwich & either soup or salad for $7.95...WHAT A DEAL!! I ordered the  Monterey Club & the No. 5 Chinese salad. What an amazingly refreshing lunch! I highly recommend this day cafe, this may not be the best review, but if you stop by the line may sway you:)"
4,"Stayed here with my girlfriend for a Radiohead show and a get away weekend from work.  Got the hotel for the amenities which were great, we played tennis, enjoyed the fantastic people watching at the pool, great cocktails to include the Tequila Sunrise, and some light putt putt outside our cottage.  The room was not ready when we got there so we got a cottage which was supposed to be an upgrade with a semi private patio.  The room was actually very nice and had a great tv which we might have watched for a grand total of 30 minutes in 4 days.  Our room was made up between 4-5 each day that we planned to stay there and then on the day we plan to check out, they came by at 8:30....not sure what the problem was there.  We also had to call about our A/C after we sweated the first night but it was fixed and no problems after that so maybe it was just a glitch which happens.  You are probably wondering what if anything was wrong, the only issue we had was the concierge.....nightmare, no help whatsoever.  Called several times, both girlfriend and I and got the reply on two separate occasions to just check google.  I have stayed at less nice hotels and had much better service with concierge, this hotel should realize what their clients might be interested in and do some research.   All in all, great trip and a nice and above par stay.  I would certainly stay here again if I can get my girl to go with me!"
4,"I went here for happy hour with a long time friend. I wanted to try something new and Switch totally fit the bill. First off, their happy hour is A-mazing! I had two glasses of white sangria that were just perfect.  My friend and I shared the cheese and fruit plate because it was on special. It was nice to try everything, and since it was on special it made everything taste better. For my meal I had your traditional cheeseburger, and it was very good. I had half to take home which made for an excellent lunch the next day.  The only thing about the place that was a little strange was the crowd. I expected for having such an awesome happy hour it would be busier, however it was kind of dead. I even saw a group of people be seated and abruptly leave. It was kind of strange. Perhaps it was just an off night. This is definitely a place I would go to again!"
5,"I went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago with my bosses. It was packed on a Friday - we sat at the bar and our cook was fantastic! We got to sit and chat with him while he worked away at the orders. I had the chicken pesto pasty and it was wonderful! the bread used is similar to a pastry dough type...but not as sweet. The pasty was so filling, I could barely finish it. My bosses have been there before and have always wanted to try the peanut butter and jelly pasty - so we all split it as dessert and it was so good. They put bananas in it and drizzle jelly over the whole pasty. Its definitely rich and gooey.  I would totally go back here again and have told my friends about it too! Amazing place."
5,"I hired Property AZ to rent my upside-down home in North Peoria (stuck with the house so we rent it out), they are very experienced and had great customer service.  I have had bad experiences in the past with management companies not taking care of the renters or getting back to me."
4,"They try to be like In-N-Out, even down to the color scheme, but the burgers taste very different.  They offer cajun fries which have some extra seasoning, and if you ask for your fries ""well done"" they dont come out as soggy.  But if youre going with someone else, then one order of fries is all youll need.  They give everyone huge helpings of fries and Im never able to finish a single order so I just share it.  The burgers are excellent and the one thing that sets this place a part is the option to get fresh jalapenos on your burger.  Dont forget about breakfast!  This is where In-N-Out fails.  The breakfast burgers are great after a night of partying."
4,"We went there for the first time recently and was pleasantly surprised. We got there about 8pm on a Friday night and the place was still packed. We only waited maybe 5 minutes to get a table which wasnt bad at all.  My date had the BBQ Chicken Sandwich with a side salad. While we were waiting for his salad to come out the server came over and said there was a mistake as he should have already receive his salad and it would be right up, which it was so not a huge deal. A few minutes later our meals came out. While he was hoping it was shredded chicken it was a chicken breast but said it was still quite tasty. I had the 10oz rib eye with sides of green beans and applesauce. The steak was cut perfectly and it was a perfect size portion. The green beans (which the server suggested) were awesome and the applesauce was a nice sweet finish so no dessert was needed. Another bonus is everything (steak, beans, applesauce) were all served on separate plates so no runny juices mixing all over the place which was perfect!!!!  The prices were very reasonable as well.  Overall, we both enjoyed Texas Roadhouse and will certainly be back."
5,"Just did take out.  Great experience.  Easy to place my order over the phone, friendly service.  Nice that they have special pick up parking spots and entrance.  Made it an in and out operation.  Ordered the gluten free pizza with pepperoni and sausage.  My husband and son loved it and have already been asking to get it again.  I had the spaghetti calzone and was in HEAVEN.  I highly recommend it."
5,"Navajo Food at its best !!!!!! I loved everything there ! I guess I love ""BLAND"" food . :-) everything was terrific ...  I ordered the bowl (12 oz) of Mutton Hominy Stew I got it with the Tortilla bread which was AMAZING ! I also ordered a side of Blue Corn Mush to dip into my stew ( which is an awesome combination) ... And I also ordered a Grape Shasta Soda :-D ... My Husband ordered the Vegetable Mutton Stew with fry bread and ordered Strawberry Shasta Soda. He loved everything ! Everything was well worth the wait and the food was extra hot and tasted very FRESH !!! I LOVED IT !"
3,"The ever evolving menu changes again, But a coupon made it a decent buy. I will admit my co workers 2 for 1 coupon is why we went in. This means ~3.25 per burrito vs the usual $6 range. What I didnt like was that my vegetarian burrito did not have vegetables in it, it was just a bean and rice burrito with guacamole. I dont know how one gets the grilled veggies in their burrito but it is not by ordering a vegetarian burrito. The drink and napkin station here has always been a bottleneck, getting a refill or more napkins is nearly impossible. I do like the fact there there is Choula sauce in addition to the red and green tobascos. And I also like that the chairs are not nearly as bad as those at chipotle. The best tip this time is get in before 12, otherwise be prepared for a long long line."
5,"Jodi is fantastic!  Extraordinary!  After too many expensive yet less-than-average salon expereinces, my hair has been less beautiful than its potential.  Jodi gave me a very thorough consultation after I did some research to find the best colorist for me.  During my appointment, Jodi was professional, efficient and friendly.  I left the salon with soft, gorgeous hair... lovely color, care of the INOA line, and I felt beautiful again.  She did what at least half a dozen other highly recommended colorists did not accomplish.  Im ecstatic and relieved and I have finally found my colorist.  What more can a girl ask?  Thanks so much, Jodi."
4,"This place is yummy. The service might not always be, but the food is. They have a sexy bar and great intimate decor and a South West feel that isnt done with terra cotta colored paint and teal cacti pictures. I love the Jelapeno Benedict and they have AMAZING margaritas. And they serve brunch till super late."
5,"Awesome, awesome, awesome....everything was fantastic. The innovative drink menu, the pizza was out of this world and the bartender was very personable. A++ I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. Bant wait to return!"
4,"I met my cousin here for lunch, and we were really happy with the meal.  The place is a less than impressive on the interior, dingy booths, long and narrow.  Its terribly crowded up by the counter, not a lot of room to order and pick up your food. I do question how a place can call itself ""Los Taquitos"" and then not have taquitos on the menu, but I went for the flautas instead.  They were good, but what set the meal apart were the beans.  The most flavorful beans I have ever had.  If you told me these were magical beans, I would have believed it, but I wouldnt have stopped eating them to plant one and see. Service was quick and friendly and there was plenty of seating, even during the lunch rush.  Looked like a lot of people get orders to go.  Id like to go back and try a few other items on their menu, if they come with beans of course."
4,"I ate here on a Sunday afternoon and was impressed by the food quality, very friendly service, and speed of service. On the strength of other Yelps, I had the gravlux with dill mashed potatoes and tomato basil salad. All excellent as others have said. I had broccoli and cole slaw as my other sides. The broccoli was tender without being overcooked and the slaw was a pleasant vinegar-based, not creamy, variety that complemented the rest of the food nicely. The food filled the plate without being overwhelming and I found room for one of the Beaver cookies, actually two large waffle-wafer cookies with a lightly flavored lemon cream between them. The cookies are kept in a chilled pastry case, probably because of the cream filling. A pleasant meal on a hot summer day."
5,"Loved this place!!!! Was searching for a great authentic BBQ place, and this is it!!!!!"
4,Beautiful church!!  We started attending mass here after they brought Jay Soto on as their music director.  He has beautiful voice and also plays piano.  We like Fr. Robinson the best - weve heard all of priests except for Fr. Sullivan.  This is not a cookie cutter church - it feels like a real church with the stained glass and the stations.  My husband is of the faith - not me and Im not given a hard time for not taking communion like the other church we used to attend. I attend to hear the music and companionship for my husband.
4,"Im embarrassed at the number of times Ive eaten here since it opened.  i used to live half a mile from here and was one of the first people in the door.  The bruschetta is the best in town--period, end of discussion.  The salads sometimes arent my favorite, but there are plenty that are delicious.  Ill admit that the cheese plates also sometimes leave me wanting, but that is a rare occasion.  It has been interesting to see the wine selections evolve over the past several years.  When it first opened, Postino seemed to have nothing above $35/bottle, and that selection was good.  It stepped up its game in the past two or three years and now boasts a more diverse and more expensive selection (e.g., Sea Smoke pinot noir).  I appreciate the addition of even better wine, and am happy to say that the glass list remains reasonably priced."
4,"A clean shopping center with many classy options for food, drink and retail therapy."
4,"being new to the area, im really on a quest to nail down my basic food groups: thai, persian, and mexican. mexican ive got down i think, but the other two ive kind of been baffled by. luckily i have my very own personal tour guide who invited me to lunch at yuphas one day.  the place is pretty cute but can get pretty crowded when in the full swing of lunch. the tables are kind of close together, so be sure you arent carrying a big purse or anything otherwise youll be whacking people in the head with it. i had the pad thai for lunch. HUGE lunch portions. i could barely finish a third of it and i had a ton to take home for dinner. also if you arent into spicy, id definitely go mild. medium spicy is pretty groovin, but i dont think it would work out well for someone who only wants a little spice. yuphas also has an interesting salad bar/soup thing that comes with some of the lunches. check out the salad with the peanut dressing. mmmmmm peanut dressing. i loves it.  service is fast and friendly. take your check up to the front if you want to get out of here quickly. i think yuphas is going to be my work lunch thai place :). garlic beef here i come!"
3,"When Im on vacation, I try to go to restaurants I try to avoid chains because whats the point?  I want to eat local eats.  As I walked in, I realized Ive been to the one in Long Beach, CA though the menu was completely different. Or perhaps it was the late night menu but it was decidely more ""Southwestern.""  Ah well, it had been several years and it was quite late at night so it didnt matter at this point. I ordered the green pork tostada which the waiter assured me was very small and the hot wings. The tostada was huge. What a liar (yes, I called him that to his face).  I ate a couple of bites and finished the wings. I would have the tostada cold and congeal-y in the morning before flying out. Surprisingly, the flavors were locked in this way and acceptable as a 5-minute scarf fest.  Oh, and my vodka tonic was very good.  Not bad and I kind of dug our picnic style bench high top table."
3,"Eyebrows are a very touchy subject. Im literally convinced that unless you make some serious cash, finding an excellent and meticulous aesthetician is like finding a needle in a haystack. Well, Yelpers, Ive been searching in this haystack for three months too long, and each time I leave thinking, ""They really dont listen to what I requested and I wasted money."" So, I decided, no longer was I going to leave spending $20.00 (tip included) on mediocre brows. I went back to doing my own, and I am completely satisfied.  Plus, the music selection is terrible. A positive, its neat that they text you a 24 hour reminder notice. However, you better be sure you show up, because they do charge fees for tardies and no-shows."
3,"I decided to give this place a whirl yesterday on my lunch about 5pm from work  the space was nice open airy the staff from front of the house to The wait staff all were very friendly linens on the tables as well as linen napkins the only thing was the menu was a little lack luster the appetizer selection was fair. Hummus,tzatziki  , served w/flat bread ,selection of olives a couple of pork belly selections I had the lamb burger I ordered medium it was served a more rare but was still good the did offer some higher priced entrees and there were other selections of burgers and sandwiches thus the name gastro pub  they had some good beers on tap"
2,"After vine expressions closed many of us have tried this place.  I like new things and love different types of cuisine but this place doesnt hit the spot.  Its nice to go somewhere and get a wine list by the glass where you can choose a wine you enjoy but of course you want to know the freakin vineyard.  Not here.  By the glass, the list just has varietals - shiraz, cab, etc.  They change their list a lot but so do many places.  The food - below average.  Tried the stew that they said was great and famous.  Bland.  The sliders were like eating a salt lick, too salty.  The servers are nice but they tend to ramble on and give you a 15 minute dissertation on the menu and why you shouldnt look at the last page because its not available yet but they want you to know its there.  Finally, a few people mentioned the sucky chairs.  Boy, they werent kidding.  They have many stools at tables with no back.  Customers should be comfortable, this is not.  The seats with backs have as much padding as a 2X4.  Bottomline, uncomfortable. You want better options, here you go.  The living room in Chandler, my wine cellar in Ahwatukee, postino in Arcadia, 5th and wine in Old Towne, kazimierz in Old Towne, and terroir wine pub in N Scottsdale.  Been to all of them and all significantly better.    Tons more on Yelp. Postino is supposedly opening where grainbelt used to be across from Joes BBQ in downtown Gilbert so when thats there a local joint should be available."
5,"The single best ribs Ive ever had at any restaurant.  This place is brand new and off to a great start.  The mac and cheese was delicious, the bone marrow was great (as usual) and the staff and chef were friendly and helpful.  Ill be back here!"
1,"I went here because all my friends were peeing their pants about how good it is. Wrong.  The slow (perhaps retarted) staff with no customer service, alongside the barely mediocre tasting pizza both contributed to my disdain for this awful eatery. Fuck it...stick to Slices."
3,"Oh, Sushi Brokers...what happened to you?! This used to be my go-to place for great ambience and delish sushi.  We ate there Friday night for the first time in a long time and they have significantly raised their prices and the sushi was subpar at best! $90 for 3 rolls and 3 cocktails. Grrrr....frustrating!"
4,A few co-workers and I were in town for a conference and decided to check out this place on a Tuesday for lunch.  Service was fast and the sandwiches were good.  The bread was fresh...I would suggest splitting because a whole sandwich is just too much for a regular appetite.
5,"Fantastic place!  we went tonight for my friends birthday-they were able to seat 15 of us without a problem.  Our waiter, Tim, was fantastic-he split the checks for everyone before we even asked.  They gave the birthday girl two pieces of delicious dessert on the house.  The food was great-we were all surprised by how large the portions were for the price.  Everyone was very polite and accommodating I look forward to going back!"
3,"Yes, I can agree it is not perfect, but at least they are trying to do something different.  I didnt eat there and since I was a designated driver I only had soda.  I really enjoyed the stand up.  It is a great place to see some local performers start their career."
4,"Ive tried 4-5 different reflexology places in the East Valley as well as numerous professional massage places (like Massage Envy which is much pricier and kind of hit and miss) and Relax Station is the place Im sticking with. (See ya later Massage Envy!) It looks unimpressive from the outside, but I like that it is very clean and unsketchy, and they have private rooms (some reflexology places Ive been to put you in a huge room with like 10 other people which feels a little strange). Theyve always done a great job, and the price is reasonable (30$/hour) compared to other places in the area (cheapest Ive found is 28$ at other places with a coupon). They also give you a full bottle of water when you finish. They also take walk-ins or reservations, and Ive never had trouble getting in when I want to. Relax Station has definitely become MY massage place, I usually end up going every 3 or 4 weeks."
3,"A little disappointed...  We have been waiting for the right moment to visit this place and today turned out to be that day.  First of all, the location is in the middle of what looks to be a ghost town.  The interior had a lot of character with items like the family owned John Deer tractor ;)  Anyway, we had the full slab with 2 sides, a bottle of ginger beer and a drink.  Honestly, I expected more from this place.  The meat was dry, bland and over done.  My bf and I both agreed that our fav in Arizona is still Famous Daves where pay pretty much the same price, get to sit and relax while they serve you, and the food is better.   *Location = kinda out there *Price = for a cafeteria style bbq....I think its a little much *Food = its not all that...at least to us *Decor = very classic and full of character *** I just received a really nice message from the owner, Joe.  I think its wonderful that Joe cares about each customers comments and reviews.  Even though my review was not a very positive one, Joe was polite and very kind.  Thank you Joe and I think Im definitely gonna persuade my bf to try your restaurant again :)***"
1,"beware of the hidden  65 cent surcharge per person for tea even if you dont drink tea?  really. The crazy thing is, im sure no one even notices the extra cost because who checks the bill? When I mentioned it to the cashier, she was stuttering and stammering and started to back pedal and said  ""oh, is this your 1st time?  we can remove it from the bill"" I said forget it, keep it. i usually tip 20-30% but ill just let them keep their meager 65 per charge.   yeah, really worth losing a customer for? my 4 year old daughter even gets the gratuitus tea party charge and she only drinks water. gone are the $2.15 per item flat rate (can you say bait and switch?) $2.35 PER so now theyre no different from the rest of the dim sum places. as sneaky as C-FOO trying to strong arm the 15% gratuity (which failed miserably and lost us and about 100 of our friends as customers) so in a down economy, youre supposed to raise your prices and sneak in stealthy surcharges? its the chinese way i guess back to china king for us.  sorry china king for being disloyal with having a brief and sordid affair with the palace. will you forgive us? haha"
3,"07/25/11 I have a new crush... and its Christophers Restaurants pizza!   Ive been holding onto a restaurant.com gift certificate Id purchased to use at Crush Lounge for a long time now and decided it was time to use it.  I arrived w/ high expectations, of both the ambience and the food, and I wasnt disappointed... much.  The service was a bit spotty at times- we were immediately greeted when we entered and were seated quickly, but the wait that came after water delivery was a bit long at a time when there were no other guests seated around us.  (Perhaps there were other guests seated elsewhere, but they werent seated at the lounge, at the food bar, nor outside... Indeed, it seemed like were were the only ones in the room, besides the cooks at the open kitchen area, the servers, and the bartenders.)  Bread was delivered, but we were each given only one one-inch slice of a baguette.  How strange, especially when the butter cup held enough butter to spread over a whole loaf!  Whatever...  Two of the three dinner specials were relayed to us, w/ the promise of coming back to tell me about the scallop dish, but when our server finally came back ten or so minutes later, he asked if we were ready to order, so I had to remind him about the scallop entree... What was in it, and how was it prepared, and how much?  Hmmm, maybe he was ready to go home... Came in w/ Mom, so we had to try the calamari.  I also chose the Duck confit, goat cheese, and fig pizza.  For dessert, we had the profiteroles.  I really liked the calamaris coating-- lightly battered and fried golden-brown.  My fave pieces of the squid are also my Moms fave, the tentacles, so these were soon finished.  At least half of the remaining pieces, the sliced bodies, were undercooked-- poor value for the $12 menu price tag (and I was charged $13 on the ticket).  The pizza* was TERRIFIC!  Loved the semolina thin crust, and the duck confit gave the entree a great smoky flavor-- I thought perhaps there were lardons included in this dish too, but all the smokiness came from the duck.  Mmmm.... The goat cheese was very creamy, and there were lovely chopped figs all over the place-- Id order this pizza again in a heartbeat!  The profiteroles were fantastic, as well.  Three sliced choux pastry rounds, filled w/ dark chocolate sorbet, vanilla, and chocolate ice cream, sat on a pretty display made of chocolate ganache and creme anglaise, whole blackberries and blueberries, and a sliced strawberry.  More ganache was poured over the top of one profiterole upon presentation.  I asked if I could have more ganache, and our server quickly obliged-- thank you!!  We loved the crisped flakiness of the pastry (so perfect!), and out of the three flavors, we liked the fudgy dark chocolate sorbet the most.  I tell you, if I couldve licked the plate clean, I would have.  :)  Excellent dessert-- I totally recommend! (*Pizza reheats well!  Still lovely in flavor and just as crispy as it was when it was first delivered.  Cant wait to go back and try the other varieties!  Happy hour UYE, anyone?)"
5,"Finally, a great place to get breakfast that isnt Dennys or iHop in Gilbert. Came here with my family and we just made it before the change in menus.  The griddle bread pudding was AMAZING! Probably the highlight of the meal. We also ordered the veggie sandwich, All-American breakfast (?), a slice of red velvet cake.   We have definitely found our go-to Breakfast joint when my sister and I, both come back to Gilbert to visit the Rents."
3,"I met up with a few ladies here for drinks a few weeks back at the suggestion of someone else. We didnt end up playing pool, just enjoyed our drinks at the bar before moving over to a table. We were definitely over dressed and probably out of place, but it was a chill place to let loose. Drinks were okay, food was nothing outstanding, prices were to be expected."
4,Fun place for breakfast.  Prices were reasonable and food was good.
4,"Surprisingly well organized displays for a location that regularly gets mauled by roving packs of shoppers.  Great sales and service, a pretty solid seasonal selection but not as comprehensive as some of the larger Anthropologies out there. The person who lays out the stuff at this store seems to space out the perfume bombs at a wider spacing so sensitive noses may be less battered by this store than some others in the Valley. The clearance racks are gold mines for sizes 8+. They occasionally have shoes, bags and swim items being sold at clearance there from in-store returns.   ( Ladies 0-6 can enjoy amazing clearance picks at the Val Vista and US-60 location! That location also has stock from previous seasons since it is so far out of the way of the typical Anthropologie shopper.)"
1,"Youll feel like you stepped in a time machine and landed in 1987.  The decor hasnt been updated in at least 20 years.  Looks like its falling apart.  The TVs are mostly 80s style TVs as well, although there are a couple flat screens as well.  This is where the trash hangs out, of all colors.  The pizza was greasy (which I like) but also chewy (which was gross).  The wings were drowned so much in sauce you couldnt find them.  Might as well get a glass of honey bbq sauce and drink it straight.  Service was interesting.  The guy that worked there was wearing capri pants and had a higher voice than my girlfriend.  The price wasnt bad- I think it was like $22 for a large pizza, wings and 2 sodas.  Id rather pay a little bit more and just go to Upper Crust pIzza down the street."
4,"Pupusas?? As a hardcore Mexican food enthusiast I was intrigued by the concept but barely able to figure out how this fascinating dish was pronounced.  I am proud to say that I am a HUGE fan of pupusas now.   Salvadoreno popped up in a search of mine to find a low-key, nice Sunday night place to relax and enjoy some food.  It definitely was worth the visit to an interesting part of Mesa. The restaurant is very similar to a lot of Mexican food restaurants anyone who has lived in Phoenix will be familiar with.  One room with several tables and a counter with interestingly-named dishes posted behind it.  The waitress was very friendly, but I will say that knowing a little Spanish helped.  My girlfriend and I both ordered the Pupusa combo platter, real risky based on other reviews - I know.  I went with Pollo and the revuelta mixed with pork, cheese and beans.  She had the chicken as well with carne asada.  This little dish is fantastic!  I think next time Ill just stick with getting two pupusas because I was extremely full and did NOT need to add rice and beans to the mix (although those were good too.) The only disappointment was the fact that Independence Day was on the TV in Spanish, but the volume was too far down to hear.  Id love to hear the voice-over actor for Will Smith busting out a ""Bienvenidos a Tierra, P***!"" On a more serious note, I look forward to heading back here as soon as possible.  Id love to try the Ceviche, as its on the Best of Phoenix list, and there are a few other dishes (think breakfast) that looked intriguing."
4,"I really wanted to have a Birthday cake for Zoeys 4th Birthday and The Bone Appetit Bakery did not disappoint.  With just 24 hour notice I was able to choose a bone shaped cake from one of 2 sizes, I chose the small (see pics) A very tasty Peanut Butter and Honey cake with cream cheese frosting. All natural human grade ingredients, no sugar, salt or additives, Zoey went nuts for it!  I also purchased her a cute little party hat to wear for her birthday (see pics) they even sell invitations if you are planning a big doggy bash! ;-)  Your dog would just Love it if you brought home a Birthday cake for them, or even some of the house made baked treats they sell here.  Go Now!"
2,"This was my first time visiting Tandoori Times.  After seeing it advertised on Groupon, I thought Id give it a try.  My friend and I decided to go for lunch to celebrate her birthday.  It was very busy, which was promising.  The waitress was on her second day working there and was unfamiliar with the menu, but she was friendly.   The house salad was mediocre, the entree (Algoo Gobi) was delicious, but the desserts were AWFUL.  The ""mango"" ice cream was a neon orange and tasted nothing like mango, or any flavor of ice cream Id ever tasted actually (kinda vanilla, kinda puke).  YUCK.  The rice pudding was not worth eating either.   The worst part of the experience was being followed out into the parking lot, after leaving the Groupon and cash tip, to be told that we needed to come speak with management about not ordering at least $40 worth of food!  Really?  I told the waiter that we had spent just over $30, and we obviously didnt expect any cash back from the $40 Groupon.  He said his manager was ""fussy"" and wouldnt like it.  I basically told him that was too damn bad, and that I wasnt ordering $10 more in food; I was actually kinda saving them $10!  He finally figured out what I was saying and left us alone.  I did end up calling the manager though, who was not pleased to hear about our experience with the dumb waiter.  I dont foresee returning there."
4,"Just had an early dinner with the kids tonight (kids eat free from 3-6pm btw).  I had the prime rib and my wife had the fish special, kids had the mac and cheese. All were great meals. The reason to go here is to sit on the patio, its fantastic!  Not impressed that at 5:30pm I had to valet, when Im with the family, Id just rather park and walk (needed to walk off the prime rib and wine anyways!).  This place is not cheap, and with $18 glasses of wine, there is no happy hour at the restaurant!"
5,"I am totally addicted to this place. Tons of flavors of smoothies, and perfectly cooked Boba. Green Tea, or even Vanilla Chi - so far all the flavors Ive tried have been fantastic."
4,Great lean pastrami and cole slaw. Marble rye and challah were a little bland and dry. I always appreciate diet Dr. Browns cream soda. Overall good lunch spot and handy location.
5,"The Thai menu is totally amazing!  I had the Panang; and the coconut curry was to die for.  I have been mistakenly driving past this wonderful place for a year.  Do yourself a favor, try Na Rai, you will be so pleased  you did.  They have a lunch menu as well."
4,"True Food Kitchen claims to not be a health-food restaurant, rather a place for great food that just so happens to be healthy. Whatever you want to call it, when you sit down, youll be handed a card explaining nutrition guru Dr. Andrew Weils food philosophies and explaining their ingredients and food items until you no longer have an appetite. However, give this place a chance - its not all about health at the sacrifice of flavor. The decor perfectly highlights the culinary concept, with clean, modern lines, big open windows, and LOTS of green. Andrews Elixir, one of their refresher drinks, was delightful. The best food item we had was the caramelized onion tart appetizer, with gorgonzola cheese, black figs, and caramelized onions on a crispy flat crust. It was the perfect balance of the sweet mild onions and sweet figs with savory cheese and light, crispy crust. Our server said this is the same crust as their pizzas, so next time Id like to try those. Next, we had the edamame dumplings, which is basically steamed won tons filled with pureed edamame in a light miso broth. These were good, not great. For our entree, we ordered the black cod, but we had to send it back because it was so fishy (and undercooked). When I asked the server if the fish is fresh or fresh-frozen, he said, ""Well, theyre all fresh-frozen."" Their fish entrees are $22, which seems inexpensive, but theyre fairly small portions. For that kind of price in this type of restaurant, I would expect fresh fish. Perhaps the fresh-frozen fish is a cost-cutting measure in what seems to be the increasingly corporate Sam Fox empire. We went with the salmon instead, which was also undercooked but far less fishy. The roasted apples and pureed celery root were lovely, but the dish as a whole was a little overpowered by the mustard sauce, and the accompanying vegetables were weird. Prices overall are very reasonable, especially if you stick with appetizers, salads, pizzas, and sandwiches. True Food aims for the lofty goal of making great cuisine that just so happens to be extremely healthy, and occasionally misses the mark, but I give them credit for bringing Dr. Andrew Weils philosophies on the importance of nutrition for the body and mind to the mainstream."
2,to make a long story short --- we had a coupon for this place.  We know its an ASU hang out but the coupon was for spend 50.00 get 25.00 off.  Ok service was not good --- when we got the bill the pizza and wings were charged separate -- not right -- it was a together order per the menu.  We had a pitcher of beer and a single beer plus food -- bill was almost 70.00 -- we gave the waitress the coupon -- she had to change the bill for the pizza and wings --- then she came back and stated the coupon had a 18% gratuity and service charge of 13.59.  Based on what ???  that actually ate up the coupon and we ended up paying full price anyway.  Never again --- and the food was fair --- not a good place to return to -- ASU take it away -- its all yours -----
4,"This place was real chill last night. I had been to the one in Downtown Phoenix quite a few times before and wasnt all to impressed, but this location is a whole nother animal. Plenty of space to do you. Something so rare in cramped up tiny Scottsdale. Crowd was alright and the bartenders were super nice. Might have to swing through the next time I hit up Scottsdale."
4,"I will tell you exactly why this place is so great. This place will blow your mind.  Not only is the service good, but the food is amazing.   Here is the rub, your friends are drunk and they start babbling on about wanting to go to some Mexican food restaurant that inevitably ends in the letters ____bertos.  It does not matter which, they all are basically the same.  You go and get your gut injected with evil and then are forced to deal with that for 10-12 hours. Talk about regret. Dont do it.  Like a child of abuse, you have the power to stop the cycle. Say ""Nah"" Like the famous sunglasses kid, ""Lets go to Mi Patio and have some fantastic food, amazing service, and keep drinking to boot.""  You will be a hero. You will make Ironman look like AquaMan (Hes a Chump.  ""You sir, command that fish into this taco."").  Short list of amazing things to be had here: 1. Margaritas. 2. Mi Patio Taco. Not a taco and not a burrito. What is it? 3. The Chips and Salsa  4. Chicken Tacos.   5.  Ice Tea.  6. Pacifico"
5,"After writing the review the other day I had a taste for Pappas. So I went last night and YA-HUMMEE! I tried something new the Hudson platter and this baby did not disappoint! Perfectly grilled scallops, 2 succulent and sweet lobster tails, 4 huge shrimp brochette. If you are not familiar with shrimp brochette it is shrimp stuffed with Monterey jack cheese and a sliver of Jalapeno, wrapped in bacon and char -grilled. DELICIOUSNESS! It is served with the fabulous dirty rice and sauteed green beans all for are you ready for this wait for it 22.95!  I also indulged in sharing a little pecan sweet potato pie with Hagen daas vanilla ice cream and bourbon sauce. WOOHOO! FYI all deserts purchased until July 26th will have a portion of the proceeds go to a local food bank!  Dinner last night was sooo freakin good I may be back tonight! Bon Appetite"
5,"The Culinary Dropout , you get the best of both worlds. The food is off the hook (its great) ,the service, these ladies and guys take care of your every need, and as a added bonus you have some of the best performers in Phoenix, entertaining you while you dinne.....Check it out....Bluesman Mike"
5,"Incredibly good calzones; friendly service, nice courtyard seating."
3,"We were visiting again, so of course that means at least 2 trips to Sugar Bowl!  The food, service and ice cream were good as always, but WOW, the prices sure have gone up.  I know that the economy sucks, but for what we got, the prices just dont seem to justify it.  We had different waitresses both times.  The fist was efficient but not very warm.  We had Sandra on our second visit - and YES, she remembered us again!  Could not believe it.  She is very friendly and can really keep up when they get swamped.  We will be back, but maybe only once per visit instead of 2 (or 3 or 4) times.  Just cant afford those prices for what you get."
3,"I would give this place 3.5 stars.  The service was excellent and the view of Pheonix at sunset was nice.  I ate the wedge salad (nothing special) and the chorizo mac and cheese (yummy).  The highlight for me was the pudding trio, the honey date flan was delicious but the portion was small...which led me to savor every bite.  The other people in my party were satisfied with their food and there were no complaints."
4,"I loved this place.  It was a little pricey but all the stuff in it had some kind of paperwork.  The paperwork explained about the materials used. I thought the lady who worked there was nice.  Dont skip go in---even if you dont buy you can soak up a little astmosphere,"
3,"They are known for their CARNE ASASDA and it  does rock but dang this place was nickle and diming me at every turn!   Everything is ala carte, and the tacos are so small,3 bites and its done. For the price tag it should at least come with a small bag of chips. Honestly the chips were so average it was disappointing. the salsa that comes with it was mediocre considering the hold out factor applied.   The salsa that came with my  tacos was exceptional, that should be their signature salsa for everything. Sodas by the can, no refills,,geezzz,, another 3.00 bucks later. I think I ended up spending over $12 for 3 small tacos and small basket of chips, and 2 sodas in z can.  For that price,  I want more atmosphere or at least a 4 bite taco."
4,"I was pleasantly surprised to find the Phoenix Public Market across the parking deck from the Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication. Its too bad its not located on the ground floor of the school, replacing the space currently occupied by Subway. It would be much healthier for the students. I had their breakfast protein shake, which was AWESOME! Even though it was $6, I ended up having TWO! While the shop is not as big as a Whole Foods, it does provide the organic and healthy staples, while serving fresh salads, pastries, and different types of chocolates. I didnt get to purchase the local bran of organic ice cream, which seems to be popular. Maybe next time Im back in Phoenix. I also liked their little coffee shop in the back room, which is separate from the main shopping area, giving you a bit of quiet to read a book or check your email. Lastly, all the staff are quirky, yet incredibly friendly. They offered up suggestions for local things to do, and were generally helpful. Overall, love this place. I wish it a long and successful life. The world needs more Phoenix Urban Markets."
3,"Its not in a shell gas station anymore and i guarantee that Guy would never visit the new location on his show. I ordered the El Pastor burrito and i didnt like it at all, very dry and just not to my liking. I would never order it again but Im sure there are alot of people out there that like it. The salsa was great and i couldnt get enough of it. I ate half of a bean and cheese burrito and i really liked that also, not the greatest tortillas ever but they are possibly #3. I would could back and id like to try some other type of burrito or some carne asada tacos."
4,"The drive to the top is really fun, and the view is worth it. I really enjoyed it here, but theres too much freakin broken glass on any of the trails down near the main shade/view structure that you should realy avoid it if you have your dogs with you and stick to the more wilderness areas. 30 other reviews = TLDR (i just learned that one, see how Im applying) so Id rather be brief and useful than wordy and redundant. I did read Chuck Rs review, and I have to say, I wish I knew more of the nooks and crannys that you do, but I can tell you that if you want to explore the Western reaches of the park, do so by starting in the center or east, and not to bother with approaching from the West side of the mountain range itself.  All youll find out there is a bunch of paranoid, possesive property owners who didnt stop to think that if they chose to own a home on a ribbon of private land that surrounds public land and restricts the public from getting to their public land, then theyll have to endure a little bit of traffic from said public.  Heres a clue for any of those property owners, whether youre on South Mountain, Piestewa, wherever....the guy sneaking around is the one you call the cops on for being a suspicious trespasser, not the guy driving a family suv with 2 dogs in the back, who calls you from the street as he sees you in your driveway so he can ask directions on how to get to the park entrance so he doesnt have to bother you nice people in the residential neighborhood anymore driving around here.    ah, duh."
5,"Great Pizza. Great Service. Weve been here a few times since it opened. And always look forward to going. We have never had a bad experience. Each time has been great. Our waiter Dave was perfect, always on the ball."
2,"This is one of those reviews where a qualifier is required.  It seems like everybody that gives this transit system a good rating is a Phoenix native.  That makes this, like so many other things, good for Phoenix.  The problem is that its terrible compared to nearly every other metro system in North America and absolutely abysmal compared to more progressive parts of the world. This is quite possible the slowest train that I have ever ridden in my life.  It seems to make stops every two blocks and it take far too long to get anywhere.  Factor in the terrible hours of operation and youre going to easily find yourself stranded at one end or the other after a night at the bar. Please work on expanding the routes and hours, speeding up the trains and then maybe youll be able to increase ridership.  Im a huge fan of mass transit but this train falls far short of expectations."
3,"Came for a friends birthday and really was not that impressed. First of all, it took us a while to find parking as this place only has street parking and a few spots in back. On Saturday if you are there before 7pm, all alcohol was 1/2 off and some appetizers were on special. We ate dinner there and the menu was very limited. The food was okay, but our burgers were over cooked. The service was slow and it took us a while to get our check. Id go to hang out again and have a few drinks, but I wouldnt suggest making this your regular hang out."
2,"Five Guys is great for those days when you want to spend $12 on a glorified fast-food hamburger. The meat comes in a wafer-thin patty, and doesnt really taste like anything, just like at Wendys. The bun tastes mass-produced.  I also dont especially care for their fries, although this is a matter of taste more than anything. Im not generally one for mushy, thick, ""natural"" fries of the sort served here.  I cant help but wonder if people rate this place purely on the quantity of food that you get. The normal size for the burger is a double-patty, and the fries come overflowing from a 12 oz. drink cup.  I would rank the burger places around mill as: 1) Smashburger, for their delicious Arizona burger, and the awesome smash fries 2) Chuckbox, for delicious char-grilled meat that actually tastes like meat 3) In-n-out, for great-tasting meat and some of my favorite fries 4) Five Guys, 5) Fatburger, seriously why the fuck does anyone eat at Fatburger?"
2,The buns fall apart so you end up eating your burger with a soggy bun.  Staff does not seem to know what is going on and they are not well trained.  Cant think on their own.
4,"I go here for the free wifi and the bleu cheese crumble salad. Thats it. Bleu cheese, craisins, sunflower seeds all on a bed of romaine. LOVE IT. I dont think Ive ever had anything else on the menu, now that I think about it. Free wifi will get me in every time, thats for sure! I chose this location because I was in Phoenix in-between activities, and didnt want to drive back to Gilbert. This was at the Biltmore, and yeah, you knew you were in a Paradise Bakery at the Biltmore. Kind of funny actually. What can I say? I like to people-watch. :-)"
3,Pretty decent food. Friendliness of staff is hit or miss.
4,"Go Go here for happy hour! From 4-7pm you can delight in their half priced apps and specialty cocktails. Their sushi rolls are meh, but their teriyaki ribs are falling off the bone, finger lickin good! The cocktails seem to be concocted for little Asian girls (which is odd since there are no Asian girls in Scottsdale, especially now that my BFF and I are gone) - fruity with cutesy names like ""Hello Kitty,"" ""Harajuku Lover,"" ""Shiso Horny,"" and ""Kinki Kooler"" just to name a few. My favorite was the ""Turning Japanese"" which was like biting into a vodka infused pear. Service at the bar was wonderful - Victoria is the one of the cutest bartenders in Old Town (guys, go pay her a visit). Drinks were flowing and the food came out quickly. In addition to the happy hour and Victoria, make sure you check out their restrooms and private karaoke rooms, complete with ""entertainment"" poles. If you end up spending a long time on their Toto toilets, people will understand why. Seat warmer and a bidet? Youll want to take your business there on a daily basis."
5,"dr. matsumoto and her team are the best!  she came recommended to me by a friend who also goes there.  they truly care about the WHOLE child and not just their medical care.  we have seen 3 of the pediatricians in the office and they have all been great.  we developed a special bond with Dr. Miller during a very lengthy health issue with my son.  its a 45 minute drive for us now that weve moved, but we still make the drive  to see dr.  miller because we  trust her to make the right decisions and offer the best advice for my childs health."
5,"This place is awesome. Affordable, tasty food.  Simple and clean country environment."
4,"When one course of a meal is so significantly better than the rest of it, its hard to write a balanced review.  I went down to Cheuvront with a few friends for Restaurant Week.  The place is tiny, very relaxed-hip looking, and right on Central Ave.  While the place doesnt have any distinct look or theme going on, there was a movie with french subtitles playing on a screen next to the dining area so...I guess its supposed to be French.  They have wine and cheese too, so, yeah, probably French. So the meal didnt start out so great.  The spinach salad came out to me on a dirty place.  Sure, its a restaurant.  I know other people use the same plates and silverware Im using, but things like that, especially when noticed, are off-putting.  Unfortunately, the ahi tuna that followed was also overdone.  Not in a bad way, and I almost didnt notice through the thick peppercorn crusting, but when it was pointed out, I was a little disappointed. That was when they pulled out dessert. Im not a sweets person.  I dont know that Ive ever been.  Give me spicy or savory 10 times out of 10 over any kind of sweet-tasting anything.  Although my dentist might argue evidence to the contrary, I really just dont have a sweet tooth.  That being said, I wanted to die and be entombed in the citrus flan that was put in front of me.  I wanted to lick the plate clean and then go back to the kitchen and demand they fill my pockets, one with the smooth, creamy, more-like-custard-than-flan flan and the other with the wonderfully sweet and subtle citrus sauce they coated the dish with.  Id also probably ask for some of the figs and berries to be put in a doggie bag. I have never, in my entire life, enjoyed a dessert as much as this one.  I would happily drive the 20-plus minutes downtown just to have this again. Before I forget or the keyboard shorts out from me drooling, the wine selection here is also amazing.  I didnt take time to look at the whole thing, but I think most wine connoisseurs would be happy here. While it was a mixed bag, the place certainly deserves another trip.  I can see (if I had a real life, not one that consisted solely of studying) sitting out on their patio, enjoying Phoenix, and making a dent in their wine and cheese stocks."
5,I have been eating at this Waffle house since I was a teenager and it has never failed to provide good food.  The employees are courteous and the service is fast.  The portions are good for the price and the small dinner feel is great to eat in.  I have gone here many times with my disabled brother and have never had any problems with the staff or employees.  I also like the fact that they are one of the few 24 hr restaurants available to eat at and this has come in handy many times.
5,"We stopped here on a Thursday night on a raving referral and they we not exaggerating - this place is fantastic! We are always a little hesitant to try a new place when an omnivore suggests it, but as vegetarians, we found Sekong by Night so accommodating! They offered to convert nearly any dish on their menu into a vegan alternative, and it was delicious. The spring rolls are really big, and they swapped their fish dipping sauce for a vegan version. We had the Phnom Penh Noodle Soup with tofu & veggie broth (just like the Vietnamese pho!) and the Katheaw Cha rice noodles with tofu instead of beef - AMAZING.  Service was top notch, and as many other reviewers noted their prices are unbelievably low for the quantity and quality of food that you get. Looking forward to our next visit and trying more fantastic dishes!"
3,"Ruby Tuesdays salad bar and healthier choices (With caloric count for calorie counters) for entrees is what sets it apart from other chain restaurants that serve your basic American style cuisine.  The salad bar includes 2 types of base greens (Iceberg and mixed greens), with various toppings (Edamame, peas, mushrooms, croutons etc.) and dressings (Italian, low fat balsamic, ranch, thousand island, etc).   Generally, with any main entree, you will have your choice of side and salad bar, or 2 sides.  They also have more healthy side options such as roasted spaghetti squash and steamed broccoli.  My husband had the chicken trio, and I had the creole fish on our visit.  The chicken was nicely presented, and was fairly tender and juicy.  Of the three different toppings (Balsamic and tomato, mushroom cheese, and mango salsa), my least favorite was the mango salsa since the mango in it, while fresh, wasnt totally ripe.  The creole fish was presented in a Spartan way, with just one piece of fish with a mound of side next to it on a plain white plate.  The fish (Some type of white fish, maybe carp?) was a freshwater white-flesh fish and had a decent seasoning and was cooked well.  Service was friendly, but we did not have any silverware on our table when we were seated and had to ask for it after our entrees were served to us.  Drinks were refilled quickly as needed. I havent indulged in a lot of the desserts, but I am a fan of the Italian creme cake.  Its moist, and not too sweet.   Prices are moderate, and entrees will be around 15 dollars, give or take a few dollars."
3,"I remember when this place first opened.  I was very excited since it seemed so ""humbling"". I came here for lunch and thought this place actually looks ""okay"" at best.  Chicken Sandwich was excellent.  The bread was toasty and crunchy, while the Chicken and toppings were warm and buttery!  However, the soup can improve.  They only gave to you 2 options so I guess I had a 50/50 chance of getting the good one!   The place was loud and popping!  Not sure what to make of it since they had wine racks and wine, but then teeny hot pink tank tops hanging from the wines.  Is this supposed to make me want to drink more wine or should I buy a shirt for my GF?  Though I dont think anyone would appreciate a shirt that says PIE.   Service was good, I guess.  Our waiter was very nice and helpful, but he seemed flustered with a smile.  He didnt do anything wrong by any means except he was going about 100 more miles than I was.  - Enjoy"
2,"Its ok, quality . Service was below par, although they were really busy. Fries were good and endless I guess thats good.. But, I was looking for a good burger, too bad I didnt find it here."
4,"I seriously love this store. I wish I didnt live so close because I always find myself here without even realizing it.  I can always find something here that is awesome. I pretty much never leave empty-handed. They have some really great deals and prices on clothes, shoes, accesories and purses. Their high end stuff is still kind of ridiculous though. But that could just be my broke-ass opinion."
5,"I LOVE this place..  This is my sushi bar.  Danny, one of the two sushi chefs is awesome.  I have always found their sushi to be very fresh. About a year ago they came out with a special sushi menu.  With rolls like these: Dirty Harry, Mr. Miagi, Rio, you cannot go wrong.  Especially if you like spicy (like me)! Even the non-sushi is great.  This is one place my 6 year old loves that doesnt have a drive through window. Also, $4.50 sake bombs!!!  $4.50! Go here.  Try it.  Dont be scared off by a couple of so-so (ok, 1 bad) reviews.  I am looking to even have a UYE here in the near future!  Should be getting a call tomorrow to get it scheduled. Almost forgot!  They have some big screen TVs!  Watch sports here!  They are hugely popular for UFC fights and football..   Just go.  Now..  Seriously.  Review part is over..  You are wasting time reading the fodder I have written here.  You could be finding your keys..  Putting on socks and shoes..  Hell, skip the socks..  Wear sandals.  Save time."
3,"Harkins 16 is exactly like every other Harkins theater.  That it to say, a huge, context-less concrete box in the middle of the desert that shows the same movies as their competitors.  I saw the Simpsons movie here tonight and just have a few thoughts to share. -The Cine Capri screen is big.  Anyone who has visited either the Scottsdale location or now-defunct Camelback relic knows this, but I felt it was worth repeating.  Very cool to see a movie on a screen larger than life itself. -There is always ""that guy"" in the theater.  You know, the one that laughs as loud as a bullhorn, repeats everything that happens on-screen, and occasionally yells out something profane or derogatory.  Now, imagine a theater where every guy is ""that guy.""  If it werent for the cool factor of the huge screen and seeing a movie Ive been waiting to see since childhood, I would have walked out in annoyance.  Seriously, what compels people to behave like this?  I dont know if this is due to the proximity to ASU (beefneck central), but it sucked. -Previously mentioned by another reviewer, but Dippin Dots are awesome.  Simply awesome. Getting out of the parking lot was a disaster.  I dont know if the whole Tempe Marketplace complex could be more poorly designed."
2,"Dropped by for a manicure, and as soon as I sat down, my manicurist started talking in rapid Vietnamese. I couldnt see her headset so I thought she was speaking to me, but obviously she wasnt. In fact, she never looked at me during the lightning fast manicure, except in confusion when I said I didnt want her to cut my cuticles -- just push them back. She really didnt understand that, and asked me in broken English why I was getting a manicure but not getting my cuticles cut. She didnt have an attitude about it, but was just really confused. I think after that exchange, she told whoever was on her phone about it. I also thought it was strange that she asked me to wash my hands after giving me a lotioned hand massage -- sort of defeats the purpose of applying lotion to my hands in the first place?  The whole experience was perfunctory, but didnt leave me wanting to return for a manicure. Not asking for a great nail technician, but it would have been nice if she acknowledged my existence other than doing my nails, and most importantly if she asked whether I wanted them cut round or square because I wanted them round!  I would have interrupted her phone conversation to let her know my preference, but she was so fast to dunk my hands back into the soaking dish that I didnt see what they looked like!"
5,"i love this place. very rarely do i get to go out and tie one on. when i do, this is were i want to be at some point in the night. where else can i go and request the cramps? i...love...this...place, it makes me happy. i suppose i should go on and on about what its like, but i wont. go and experience it for yourself."
5,"This is our favorite breakfast place. The food is good. They have the best biscuits & gravy of any restaurant I have eaten at. The wait staff is friendly. The only complaint I have is that Sunday mornings are packed, so there can be a wait to be seated."
1,"I will be moving to Phoenix in the Winter and I thought Id scout out some LFS while I was visiting, which led me to Reef Culture. At first I was positive seeing some nice looking displays and LED use, however this soon changed.  On closer inspection, lots of the tanks were infested with aiptasia and bubble algae, and prices of coral were hugely inflated compared to other prices in the area and back home. The people were very unprofessional and unfriendly and first ignored me entirely despite trying to flag someone down. When I did manage to get their attention, I was belittled and treated like a child who knew nothing about the hobby (I have had marine tanks for over a decade ranging from large 55 gallon+ to tiny DIY LED picos).  After this rude and demeaning experience, I continued to peruse the last few tanks and came across an angler fish. I watched him and he followed me as I walked down the isle as far as his tank would go and I backtracked a couple steps, amused that he was slowly walking along the tank with me. There was a loud crack as the man behind the counter slammed the phone down, snapped his fingers at me, and told me to ""stop harassing the fish."" Keep in mind, I was not tapping on glass or prodding anything as I am quite short and I could barely reach to the high up tank where the angler fish was, much less reach to ""harass"" any fish. After this rude treatment I promptly left. This kind of unprofessional treatment of the customers is shocking and unacceptable, not to mention the bubble algae infested tanks (one spore of that on the water that you get your coral in and your tank is infected too).  I wont be doing business here when I move."
1,"After bad experience, I will never return.  It is terrible since they didnt meet my expectation and the price is outrageous.  The most difficult part of the Pho is the broth (req 16 hours of preparation) and it tasted like water.  I had to add all kind of condiments to rescue it but cant even eat it.  The restaurant is very slow now and it confirmed what I meant with Asian restaurant.  If your fellow Asians dont patronize the place, it is  because your food did not meet our expectation.  Try across the street to the Rice plate Kim Thanh for their rice dish.  It is night and day."
1,"MY EXPECTATIONS WERE EXCEEDED!  Ive been searching for so long to have a dinner experience that MET all of my expectations - for a restaurant that I SHOULD NEVER PATRONIZE.  Mimis in Goodyear actually exceeded my expectations.  On Oct 26th, while visiting the area, I made the unfortunate mistake of recommending we dine at Mimis because of previously good food and service there.  But, alas, if the old Mimis quality still existed, they wouldnt have exceeded my expectations for WHAT NOT to experience in a restaurant. Let me recant why YOU or ANY ONE ELSE (except those people you truly dislike) should never patronize this facility.  First of all, the interior temperature was at least 80 degrees (when it was less than 65 outside).  We had to ask for the air conditioning to be turned on. Next, we ordered the artichoke dip appetizer.  It looked funny.  It tasted funny.  The tortilla chips actually resembled pita chips.  If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it must be a ______. I ordered the chicken cordon bleu which is supposed to be served with ""seasonal vegetables"" and ""homemade mashed potatoes"".  Can someone explain to me how MIXED seasonal vegetables can be served where the brocolli is steaming hot, but the carrots mixed with them are literally still frozen in the middle?  Thats a feat.  My ""homemade"" mashed potatoes?  Cold.  A sliver of butter placed on top of the mashed potatoes would not even melt to graphically show our waitress ""the problem"" .  Even after this effort, no offer from the wait staff (or manager-missing-in-action) was ever made to either warm up the potatoes, replace them ......or, perhaps, use them as wall spackling. After all this, they sincerely asked us if ""everything was all right"" and ""would we care to order dessert"".  At least they have a sense of humor. Never again."
5,"Roka Akor has a classy atmosphere, and a slightly formidable menu to pick from. Everything looks so good, and in a new environment, I want to try it all! But my date and I, after much deliberation, decided to ""go for broke"", as it were and if we couldnt finish, at least we had a good sample of the menu.   For an appetizer, we got the butterfish tataki and the burnt red tomato salad. These were yummy little tidbits that disappeared off the plate quickly. The butterfish was delicate, and the salad was great - the greens had all sorts of different flavors, and not that ""generic clump of lettuce"" flavor I hate.  From the sushi menu, I was feeling adventurous and had never had raw red meat before, so I ordered the wagyu gunkan. My date saw the amount of green onions piled on top of this dish and oh-so-chivalrously gave me his piece. Its true that you needed a healthy appreciation of green onion to like these as served. The wagyu beef is ground nearly to a puree - which I wasnt expecting, and I thought the onion was a bit much.  At for the skewers we ordered, my date liked his sweet potatoes the best, but I was partial to the crispy BBQ. These turned out to be two large ovoid and solid shapes of rice, run through with a skewer. Pure white sushi rice in the center, the outside was caramelized with what tasted like the sweet BBQ sauce that comes on eel sushi, which gave the whole thing a nice, crispy shell.  At this point, I got to what I consider to be the crowning achievement of the meal: the yuzu marinated black cod. The cod, cooked on the robata grill in a leaf, was meltingly soft and delicately flavored. It was an effort to be share fairly. I believe my date said after our first taste of it, ""Just eat what you want and Ill finish ..."",  I looked up from my chopsticks, ""... you know what? Just cut me off half.""  I wasnt sure that I could handle dessert after eating so much, but we finally decided it wouldnt be fair not to give the dessert menu a looking over, right? So we ordered the baked green tea custard, and it was a perfect pick after a gut-busting meal. Light and airy, it also had some carbonation to it that tickled my taste buds and made me giggle a lot as I was eating it.   Our sampler of shochu ranged from impressive to harsh, at least to my taste buds. In order starting with least harsh: pineapple, honeycomb, raspberry, and apple. I didnt like the last two, but the pineapple was, in my mind, a fairly dangerous thing to drink when youre not paying attention. Smooth.  Thats it for the food, and as for the service, it was swift and considerate; glasses were kept full, and empty plates whisked away. There was, however, one glaring exception that nearly overpowered the entire evening with its oddness. The waiter, who had up till this point been very nice and chatty, helpful about menu items, and generally a pretty cool guy, handed me his phone number and told us to call him any time we wanted to go partying.   What am I supposed to do with this? Are we going to call our waiter up and say ... well, what? It flummoxed me."
3,"The food here is good. Its not outstanding, or anything to write home about, but it IS tasty.   The whole making a tortilla in front of your eyes seems a little kitch-y to me, but so what? Everyone has to have a marketing ploy. Ive eaten in, and taken out, and the burrito quality is about the same.  Personally, I like Chipotle better, as I like the dressing on their veggie salad. My one beef (amusing, since I only get the beans) is that they were a little too light handed with everything. I got hardly any guacamole or sour cream, and that is really what helps to make a delicious tasty burrito of goodness in my eyes. Will I go back? Certainly, if its on my way and Im hungry. Will I choose to seek it out? Probably not."
5,R.T. OSullivans really hit the spot! The service and the atmosphere were outstanding. We were put into the back room which was perfect for our large group of 45 plus. The server kept track of everything even as people moved around and socialized. The food was wonderful.  We will be going back!
1,"I was so happy to see another station in the neighborhood.  I went in to fill up as I usually do at any station unaware that I was paying TEN CENTS MORE PER GALLON (than Circle K)  because I wasnt paying cash or using a Shell credit card.  Yes, there are signs on the pump but, really, who would think to look for such a requirement?  Ive been buying gas for over 40years and have never seen such a non-cash penalty.  I, and my children, their spouses and our friends will not be getting gas there ever again.  How disappointing and dishonest."
5,"Super friendly. Joe was there greeting everyone, refilling coffee, and sharing how we uses local Arizona suppliers. Great diner food and decor. Loved the biscuits and chorizo gravy.  Will definitely be back."
5,"Im giving Bobby Q an extra star in this update to my previous review, because although it has its share of hits and misses, it is, in fact, as good as it gets in Phoenix for great barbecue. I love barbecue. It is a hobby of mine. When I get stuck on something and want to know what it should look and taste like, I go to Bobby Q and am almost never disappointed. Most recently, this happened with beef brisket. Im going to upload a picture I took of Bobby Qs brisket because seriously, if you look at it and dont want to immediately die from desire, then you just dont like barbecue. If I had anything bad at all to say about Bobby Q, it would be that sometimes their meats can be slightly overdone but this is not the norm. Their quality control, considering how much food they must serve to keep up with the demand, is astounding.  Their prices are too high, but of course, youre paying for the almost Disney-esque atmosphere. Their sauce is absolutely delicious (although it should be noted: they dont understand what ""spicy"" means). All in all I really cant say enough good things about this place. Go look at my brisket photo. Seriously."
5,"I was in Bomberos for breakfast this morning, and I was told they now carry Coca Lite!  So much better than Diet Coke - I had no idea I could find it anywhere in the US!  How great is that? Also, Bomberos is now using MJ Breads and Tammie Co pastries... not too shabby, huh?"
1,"Great at first, then the bartender ignored me and my friends for a good 20-30 minutes, put everyones bill on my tab. I opened a tab so this wouldnt happen then they made us wait another 15 for them just to ask us who had what. Then they over charged us by quit a bit. We had to flag someone f=down from napkins and plates and it took a few trys for a water. And to make matters worse my friend got a parking ticket because they took so long. There were three bartenders for what I handle myself at a bar on a daily basis. No sorry from any of them and not even a drip of regret from the manager. He pretty much told us to chill out after this whole 45 min waiting or deal, just to close a check. Kind of a joke really."
2,"The new Frys in the burbs are awesome, but this old relic is pretty bad. Ugly with a with a smaller selection, plus staff who pass you in the aisles (when youre obviously looking for something) without asking if they can help. If youre in this neighborhood, head over to the nearby Safeway."
2,I really wasnt impressed with the service or the food.
5,"This was my first experience with Lush (with many more to follow).  I stumbled into the store because I could smell it 4 stores down, and I was drawn in by the aroma (I dont even thing I read the name on the sign...I just followed my nose).  I had never seen anything like it!  The giant blocks of soap, the colorful bath-bombs, the bubble bars (that looked like little cakes), and so much more!  It was late December, so the sales staff told me that any left-over Christmas items were buy 1 get 2 free (what a deal on my first visit!).  They demonstrated a bath bomb for me, and I was MESMERIZED!  I got 6 Christmas bath bombs (4 of them for free!) and 3 travel-sized Snow Fairy shower gels (another Christmas product, and by far one of my favorite Lush products EVER).  I also got some non-holiday bath bombs and melts because they were just too heavenly to pass up (I got a Youki Hi bath bomb, my favorite bath bomb ever, which was sadly discontinued sometime last year).  I also got my first piece of Lush soap (Sexy Peel. all the citrus just makes me smile when I use this soap. Its sunshine in your shower) Since I used to work in the mall I would go into Lush whenever I had a break and get a couple things, and the staff always recognized me :) They even offered me a hand-cream sample one day when I was complaining of dry hands.  I brought some of my friends from school in and told the girl behind the counter that they were newbies, so she rushed out from behind the counter to demonstrate EVERYTHING in the store!  Literally, she showed us bath bombs, bubble bars, face cleansers and toners, massage bars, and dusting powders.  I was so impressed by her powder demo that I bought some Candy Fluff dusting powder (another item that has since been discontinued.  Vanilla Puff powder is a nice substitute). This store holds a special place in my heart because it was the first Lush store I ever went to, and I will forever have fond memories of the staff that dazzled me, and every time I smell Sexy Peel Soap or SnowFairy Shower Gel I am reminded of that magical day :)"
4,"We were exceptionally sun deprived by the time March came around, so that may have swayed my review to be exceptionally sunny.  I was pleasantly surprised by the FLW inspired architecture (I didnt do any research on the hotel-my husband picked it) and by the beautiful grounds. Our room was very comfortable but we spent the majority of our time at the pool or on the  patio relaxing.  It is definitely not 5 star service across the board, but no one was rude. Our room wasnt cleaned the entire 3 days we were there, even after we asked the front desk to send housekeeping. That didnt get us down--after all, we didnt come there to hang out in our room. At Frank and Alberts, the staff gladly switched the TV to the game we wanted to watch and the food was great."
5,"Any time I have out of town visitors who want ""real"" Mexican, I take them here. The chips are fresh, the salsa is divine, and after downing two baskets, you realize you need to eat an entree! Ive eaten a variety off the menu, and nothing has disappointed me. The burros are stuffed full, the crisps are mouthwatering and the enchiladas melt in your mouth. The ONLY downside is the location. Just not a great part of town, though they are trying very hard to revitalize it. Go there anyway! Just try lunch time first."
5,"Zin, zin, zin - Yes, yes, yes! Several weeks ago five of us had a wonderful Monday evening at Zinburger with our delightful server, Candace. I arrived early, inquiring about the Left handed Polestar Pilsner, Candace offered a sample, very tasty - with three of my party eventually having it with dinner.  We had a great booth - giving us a vantage point, watching the parade of customers & employees. I really like the airy, roomy, high energy vibe. With our drinks we had the delicious zucchini fires with two sauces an a subtle breading on the zucchini. We all tried different burgers, with some of us tasting each others, Candace made the split arrangements prior to serving us - nice touch. The meat is flavorful, melting in your mouth with a freshly baked bun. Fun, cool atmosphere & great food - made for a great get away, early in the week. My hats off to the Sam Fox team, another winner at ZinBurger."
1,"Buca Di Beppo is literally, italian restaurant hell. You know how all big box chain restaurants throw junk up on the walls in an attempt to make the space feel vintage? Buca Di Beppo throws junk, and knick knacks and statues and anything else italian they could find in the chinese warehouse where they loaded up these goods. Its a terrible horrible mess and you end up sitting in a yardsale of italian paraphenalia while eating your very bland pasta. Its embarassing how truly flavorless the food is here. Thin, flavorless alfredo sauce. Thick slabs of lasagna with less taste than what I can get out of the frozen section at Publix. I went with a large group and across the table, bland food. When they seat your party, they guide you through the kitchen area where the cooks play along and say a welcoming hello. Deep down you know they hate this. Why are we in the kitchen? Sure its nice, but Id rather have them concentrating on making the food, and making it good. Of course, the food at Buca Di Beppo seems to be far beyond any point of return to tasting good. Its just dead. Dead food. No life, no flavor, not emotion. I get more flavor from the $.99 Michelinas frozen lunch package. Far from claiming anything authentic Italian, Buca Di Beppo even pumps out bread with no taste. Eating at Buca is like eating food from an assisted living facility. No salt, no sugar, no butter, no fat, its all gone along with anything resembling taste. Sure, Buca has huge portions, and the setup is nice for large parties and families - but they might as well just buy the family-size pasta packs from the frozen section and bake it at home, even that would be better, and they wouldnt have to the mandatory gratuity. Say what you will about other italian chains like Macaroni Grill, or Olive Garden - at least their food taste like something."
2,"Ate here months ago.  Was excited to finally find a Phoenix sushi venue, and one that also offered brown rice as a sub for sushi dishes (dont quote me on this however, since it has been many months and I may be recalling another venue).   One item did impress me, and that was the complimentary appetizer that was comprised of tempurad chips with perhaps a squid salad topping (?)  I should have just ordered another serving of this!  Instead, I tried an Ao Yasai (mixed gourmet greens with ginger) and a sushi roll w/ brown rice, the latter I thought was price-y considering the very small portion given.  I was so unimpressed by its unexciting flavors that I dont even recall what kind of roll I tried!  Pretty sad, I know.   I told myself I wouldnt go back, but I would like to give Hana another try, perhaps for lunch and/or dinner with a group of friends and have apps and wine/sake!"
4,"Wow, this was one of the best dinners I have had in a long time. I definitely have my favorite spots but it is rare that I have an entree that knocks my socks off. For me, this was the gnocchi dish with the shitake dijon cream sauce. My husband was surprised that I ordered this, since I dont like mushrooms, and luckily for me, the extent of the mushrooms were some medium ones in the sauce. The gnocchi were very tender and the sauce was rich and creamy. I felt like I was eating a delicious mac & cheese with some soft foccaccia bread. OMG. We also ordered the porteguese style mussels that were a fave of my husbands. They were just okay to me but overall, were decent. We also ordered the chorizo and manchego risotto that I really liked. We each had a glass of wine. Our server was kind enough to let me sample the prosecco before I ordered it. Good thing I did because I didnt like it. The server asked what kind of wine I liked and then brought me a taste of their white blend which I enjoyed. Overall, before tip, our bill was $50. Very reasonable for three plates and two glasses of wine.  This place is extremely small inside with 4-6 small table inside and 3-4 tables on their patio. There were two servers and on a busy Fri night, service was slow. But they were very nice and apologetic, so I gave them a break. I noticed the kitchen staff worked extremely efficiently which is a plus for such a small space. I was very impressed. I cannot WAIT to come back here as there were several plates that looked amazing."
4,"Was here awhile back and Sharon Hs review will sum it for atmosphere but i will try and cover my feelings on the taste. The bruchetta is great. Yeah really that simple. I havent tried much but bruchetta here but havent really been disappointed either. Even the ones that ""havent been a fan of"" of the ones i tried when i have mixed and matched when getting to select I still would order over bruchetta at most places as they are still very good. Did try a pizza once and wasnt amazed but nothing stood out (its been awhile since that). The bruchetta however comes to mind every time i hear the word. Oh and the service is very friendly and attentive. One night I was in and they had just finished a major catering event and it had said on the front door that the kitchen was going to be slow until about the time we arrived. Yet when we ordered and it took a bit to get the food (barely a delay in my book and if I hadnt been apologized to by the waiter probably wouldnt have know it was longer than normal) we got a nice little discount."
5,I eat here often and the lunch special is great!!  Food and service are equally good.  Fries are to die for.
5,"I really like this place...  Taking the advice of Yelp we stopped in on our way through downtown.  We were immediately greeted as we walked in. I told the staff it was our first time in and asked which sandwich was the best.  Following the recommendation I ordered the Crackerjack, cracked pepper turkey and melted pepper jack cheese with lettuce, tomato, onion and Russian dressing. We also ordered the Godfather, cappicola, salami, pepperoni and melted mozzarella on garlic toasted bread.  Lets take a moment and show the bread some much deserved love. It tastes fresh with a chewy center and crisp exterior covered in sesame seeds. You could put a shoe on this bread and it would taste great.  I really enjoyed the Crackerjack. The Godfather was good for a few bites, but too rich for me.  I cant wait to come back...  Great choice for lunch downtown for a very fair price.  Unless you are completely starving, share a sandwich!"
4,"Great burgers and menu offerings.  You would expect to get a good burger with a name like that and you do.  The sweet potato fries, Frenched fried onions, and Salmon Salad are very good too.   The decor, location, and menu are restaurant alternative for the area.   The menu was a little confusing and little pricey yet the quality of the food is there and considering the location of the restaurant pricing isnt an issue.   I do recommend to restaurant to others."
4,"Shopping around TMP made me thirsty for a cocktail.  There is some type of Cantina I passed by that did not look relaxing so I went to my Yelp app to see what else was around when I saw the Thirsty Lion.  I was expecting an English pub-like atmosphere and I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in and saw the clean and modern decor.  I sat at the bar, a great thing about this place is that it has HH on the weekends!  The bartender wasnt that great.  He just threw down a drink coaster and walked off.... uh... really?  When he came back around I ordered a specialty drink - mint and cucumber cooler or something like that - I was hoping for more cucumber than mint but the mint was overwhelming, it tasted more like a mint julep.  They did have a great selection of beers on tap but I really wanted a cocktail so the next round was a jack and coke.   I wasnt planning to eat but I noticed some hard-boiled eggs wrapped in sausage on the HH menu, I had to try those, its not often that I see something unique on a menu.  They were pretty good actually. I cant wait to come back."
4,"Ive always had consistent quality of food and service here.   Standard menu....everything is a la carte.  Ive been to this specific location about half a dozen times.... I recommend City Hall or Mastros (N. Scottsdale), over Mortons.  But between Flemings and here, its a tossup.  I would eat at either....but I would probably choose Flemings over Mortons."
5,"The best ! From my first shredded beef taco almost a year ago  ..i have been lovin this place. I also love the number 13 combo platter (.Mini beef chimis ,Gauc ,rice and beans)  The tacos are 5 star fresh and yum ! ... AND reasonably priced."
3,If I hadnt recently found Yogurtland in Scottsdale I would be raving about this place. Unfortunately it is  45 cents an ounce and the other place is 30 cents. Both have a nice variety of flavors but this place is missing the water cooler. You do get a bit sticky from eating your treat. There is something they have that yogurtland doesnt have. They have marshmallow and peanut butter in squeeze containers which is to die for!!
4,"I love this Starbucks. We all know every Starbucks is expensive, so forget that. But these people have our drinks memorized, if you go there alot anyways, theyre on top. Good Starbucks."
5,lululemon is the best clothing store to hit Scottsdale since Ross.  Even though exercise shorts there cost more than an evening in Tijuana they are worth every penny. So what if the pants there cost $160? They are awesome. Would Batman ever question Alfred about how much he paid for the Batmobile? No. Because the Batmobile is awesome and Batman would have paid any price for it.  The mens side of the store doesnt carry a wide collection but what I did find was more magical than the sorting hat at Hogwarts. Everything is so comfortable and if youre overweight most of the pants and shorts have elastic so you dont look like a muffin when you put them on.  I also like the workers there too. They are friendly and helpful and helped me understand that even if I liked some of the womens shirts there it would not be a good idea for me to purchase one and wear it. But I love teal I cried!  If you havent been to lululemon that probably means you hate small animals.
4,"We went to Christophers with the Deal Chicken 3-course dinner.  The food was very good and the service was just as good.  The lobster bisque was a bit too thin for my taste and is something I would pass on in the future. The lamb was delicious and the tuna salad was tasty as well.  We opted to order dessert and the mousse tower was delicious.  We were saddened that they did not have the grand marnier souffle on the night we went, which was highly recommended.  Will return!"
5,"I have been Chipotle faithful for about 2 years now, and it wasnt very difficult.  Restaurants such as Rubios and the Blue Burrito just didnt stack up to a Chipotle burrito.  Then came Qdoba. This restaurant is pretty much a carbon copy of Chipotle (2 of the employees on duty actually worked at my former Chipotle of choice).  I had a chicken burrito (my Chipotle norm) so I could make as direct of a comparison as possible.   The food was great, and afterwards I didnt get that ""punched in the stomach"" feeling that Chipotle gives me for some time after I eat it (I am convinced their rice expands in your stomach, but it tastes good so I suffer through it).   I also picked up their frequent customer swipe card (buy 10 burritos get one free + free chips and salsa after activation).  This place is closer to my place than any Chipotle, so I will be coming very often!  P.S. If anyone if privy to the correct pronunciation let me know! (ku-doh-ba???)"
4,"Saketini opened not too long ago, so theyre still having grand opening specials.  Get em while theyre hot! I havent had their food yet, but I have partaked in their fantastic drink specials.  They have $2 well drinks for happy hour.  Woo hoo! Plus they have a reverse happy hour too, which scores them another star.  Any place that offers late night drink and food specials is alright in my book.  Once I try the food, Ill be back and Ill update the review."
3,"This is your run-of-the-mill sports bar that caters to the not-so-blue-collar 30something crowd of Chandler.  The ambiance is nice, darker, big screen TVs everywhere... the waitresses are attractive (a staple at these types of places) and they are friendly and attentive... ours was on this very day.   Its Beer Week in AZ this week and they had just hosted a SanTan event (pub crawl) today as part of Beer Week, so they were understandably out of SanTan Devils Ale and the place was quite quiet when we arrived at 5pm. We got seated at the patio where the have a nice little Bocce ball area and it was nice to enjoy the great Phx February weather. Alright, so we ordered burgers as we were both in the mood for a sizable piece of beef, hopefully topped with bacon and other yummies.  They did a pretty good job for being a sports bar, but not impressive. They claim their meat is fresh ground, though when thats the case, the patty has a different type of form and is less flat and compacted.. okay, maybe they grind it in the AM and then stockpile patties for the day.. thats fine.  The bacon (I ordered the #9 All Star - cheddar, bacon, beef) was lame... thin, a bit stale-tasting, and not crispy.  The cheese was fine.  I did like that the meat was char-broiled and so it has a good taste to it.  Also, the inside wasnt over cooked and the bread they served it on was kinda sweet and giant... tasty, actually. The sides were blaaaah.. cole slaw was really boring and had literally 3 ingredients (white cabbage, carrots, sugary mayo) something I would expect from Chilis or Dennys. Well, the burger hit the spot but the rest was plain and boring.  The Stella was not as cold as I prefer.  Our staff was very good.  So far, an OK place to visit, but a 4 star place is somewhere I will likely go out of my way to visit.. this didnt make the cut."
5,"I had heard many great things about Penzeys, but it wasnt until recently that I actually went to the store. After shopping around and smelling various spices, I wanted to buy everything in the store! Great for gifts as well!"
5,"I took my daughter there to get her nose pierced for her birthday, they were very nice and professional and made her feel comfortable.  Its a nice shop and they were very friendly and did a great job.  I will definitely recommend them!"
5,"Been twice. Authentic, high quality & great price for what you get. Salsa de Chile de Arbol was the best!! Loved the decor. Orchata tasted fresh, which is a rarity in most Mexican Restaurants."
4,"This cute little neighborhood breakfast/lunch spot just opened up, and is the sister restaurant to Tuck Shop.  The menu is small with super reasonable prices!!  Not much in the way of vegan fare, but I managed to find a tasty dish: The Red Flannel Hash (beet, potato and root vegetable hash sans eggs).  It was very tasty and had a nice amount of black pepper in it.  I also ordered a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice for a grand total $8 and change.  Not too shabby for brekky.   My dining cohorts ordered a frittata topped with sour cream and chives, a Portuguese doughnut and biscuits stuffed with some kind of meat (I forget the name of this dish) and were equally pleased with their meal. Not sure about parking, as we walked over (so awesome!) from their house.  This is a quaint little gem with indoor and outdoor seating.  They also have booze, so you can add a little pizazz to your wake up call.   Great place, cant wait to come back!"
2,"Carls has raised the price on its food so that the $6 burger is now actually almost $6. The big marketing ploy here was that you could get a burger for just a few dollars that was the same quality as what other places charge $6 for. Not anymore. Additionally, they have not resolved the issue of employees that speak so little English that they are unable to either take or execute your order correctly. We have emailed Carls in the past regarding this issue and are just tired of having to bring it to their attention when they get the order wrong (which is most times now).  We have now decided to just go across the street to the In N Out burger at Fiesta Mall for any future burger runs. You can get a burger for half the price and the employees speak English and can get your order right."
5,"A burger? With anything I want? FINE....Ill do it. I need no convincing for a burger, fries and a coke (Thanks Carls Jr.)  Earleir this afternoon, after a heavy morning of househunting with a couple realtors, I decided to sit my fat backside at a table and eat. And eat well. I stumbled into the Five Guys at the Fashion Square mall. Not sure how long its been open. Perhaps it was the grand opening? It was PACKED! But I digress. As soon as you get to this location in the food court of the mall, youll realize that this is not your typical burger joint. They have their own seating separate from the mall-commoners. And their own bathrooms (CLEAN) You get to the counter and you see a sign telling you about the potatoes they are using for the fries you will be eating. Ordering your burger isnt a gong show. Fairly easy. All the toppings are listed and all toppings are FREE! My food was delicious. Got a burger with some of my favorite toppings: onions, tomatoes, etc.  The fries reminded me of an experience I had back in high school, when I held a girls hand for the first time. Soft, perfect and lovely. Thats how these fries felt. Ok that sounded weird. Tough. Oh, I forgot to mention that the soda fountains had COKE ZERO!! EFFING AWESOME! I MEAN THIS IS THE MOST DOPE SODA EVER!!  (Im really hoping this Kanye yelping phase ends soon, since my reviews make me seem like a bigger Jackass than I seem in person). Ultimately, I left this place happy, satisfied and I will come back again. Oh...the answer to the one question in everyones mind? YES, BETTER THAN IN-N-OUT!"
5,"Warning, dont get deterred that there arent any seats for you when you walk in... thats a good sign that the the tables are full with everyone stuffing their faces.  I waited for about 15 minutes for a table to free up, and Im glad I did.  It was kind of a chilly night and I was feeling for something hot.  I decided on the seafood noodle soup and pork pies.  The noodles soup broth was lightly seasoned with a hint of white pepper (just the way I like it), the noodles were thick and hearty, and the portion was substantial.  The pork pies (3) were like a flattened pot sticker that had been pan-fried on both sides, Yum! Definitely, a place serving up genuine Chinese food with the finesse of a home-cooked meal. I cant wait to go back!"
4,"I tried Pork on a Fork at the ASU Tempe farmers market. Beef brisket and pulled pork sandwiches were sold there in a small tent. My sandwich (brisket) was very tasty, albeit a little plain (just meat and bread). There were three great BBQ sauces available - sweet/mild, tart, and spicy. I used a lot of all three, but spicy was the best. I felt like I could drink those sauces! At $6-8, the sandwiches are a little pricey, but they are filling and taste excellent. It would be nice if they came with some corn, beans, or the like to round out the meal."
1,"After a day full of meetings, I gathered the hubster and we headed out to eat some Mexican. I had visions of chips/salsa, and margaritas. We headed to On the Border on Stapley near Baseline but found that this location had closed. Egads. Then we remembered The Salty Senorita across the street. And thus begins the saga. ""Hi, are you here for happy hour?"". We said no but were seated in the bar area anyway. At least we got a booth. Lucky us, huh? Joe ""lots of product in his hair"" brought us menus and took our drink orders. He was pushing a certain type of Tequila and I took the bait, with the stipulation ""on the rocks with salt"". My drink, and hubsters water arrived and we ordered. The chips and salsa AND our dinners arrived at the same time. .Really Joe product??? Chips with the meal? FYI, chips and salsa here arent complimentary, you have to order and pay for them. It was then we noticed ants had taken over our table. At first we thought it was just a couple but noooooooo. The hubster brought the ants to the attention of Joe product and he feigned concern but did not offer to sit us at another table. Now the hubsters getting annoyed. Its hard to enjoy yourself when you are swashing ants off the table. Our booth was by a window but we didnt see any influx from the window of ants, so were not sure where they are coming from, but they dont stop. Hubster mentions it a second time, and then, again with feigned concern he offers to move us to a different table. By this time we are almost done eating and I just say lets finish and get the hell out of dodge. Our bill comes, we pay, and hubster asks for the manager. Hell, hes even younger than Joe Product and looks like he just woke up, thus well call him Bed Head. Bed Head offers to buy us a drink on the house? Really? Thats your solution? He said hed make sure other patrons arent seated in this area. Egads, no thanks, we just wanted to leave. We werent after free food, but the offer of 10% off or some kind of compensation for sharing our entire meal with ants would have been appreciated. A free drink? Hey,maybe one of those $60.00 margaritas would have made everything alright! As far as the food goes-I had the chicken antchiladas (get it, lol) with beans and rice and they were dry. I like my enchiladas with oodles of sauce and cheese, and these had very little sauce with a little design of sour cream on them. Hubster had a steak and avocado salad. He said it was ok.  This is a never return place for us.  And a note to Joe Product-chips and salsa should have arrived WITH the drinks, and before the meal.Reflecting back, we were there on Earth day so perhaps having ants share our meal was relevant. The margarita gets a 7 out of 10 limes as it was pretty good."
5,"Finally, well-qualified, well-established mechanics that dont talk to me like Im a dumb, car-ignorant girl - even if I am. I was sitting at a desk establishing an estimate for my Honda within 20 minutes of calling them. The receptionist was polite and efficient, but truly the best part was their interactive, transparent estimate process. I was able to view the screen as my estimator drag and dropped the parts he suspected I would need into a spreadsheet. Then, I saw him calculate the labor hours - something I had NEVER been privy to before. Tracys Auto Body was affordable, very quick and went above and beyond - alerting me to other pieces that were loose and fixing them for free. I highly recommended their services. They have a perfect record since the mid-1980s with BBB and with good reason."
3,"They dont have the lunch specials on the menu or tell you about them if you dont ask, so make sure to ask. The sandwiches dont come with fries and their fries are over priced for not being very good. The pulled pork sandwich is good and so is the sauce. Also, expect a long wait especially if people are ahead of you."
3,"Alright, so here is my two cents on Brat Haus. I suggest to steer clear of the brats I tried (Beer Brat & Spicy Thai).  I found them a bit dry and bland.  I also found the pretzels less than fabulous. I do suggest to try to big, juicy, tasty, meatballs. Much better choice. The outside patio very cool, an open fresh space with plenty of seating and a big ol wall of funky art. The service was also friendly, and attentive and fair prices. Overall, its totally worth checking out if you are in the area and in the mood for something different."
3,"Lets start with an SAT-type question: Scottsdale Stadium :: AT&T Park is like _______ :: Oakland Coliseum. a) Oakland As b) Rickey Henderson c) Phoenix Municipal Stadium d) Yankee Stadium If you answered C, you, my friend are correct.  And youre pretty smart, too.  Give yourself a pat on the back. Much like Oakland Coliseum, Phoenix Muni wont amaze you with state-of-the-art facilities, breathtaking views or spectacular nightlife nearby.  What you get here is a functional, simple, 40-year-old ballpark that serves its purpose.  The crowds here are much smaller than you would encounter at other parks, but it fits 6000-7000 people comfortably.  Unless you are in the premium infield seats, you will be sitting on the aluminum benches or on the grassy knoll.  Pick your poison, so to speak. We always get the infield seats, because you can sit 12 rows behind home plate for under $20.  I dont care how bad the economy is, its a steal!  Even if you sit directly behind home plate, you will most likely struggle to see the tiny outdated scoreboard screen in the centerfield.   There are no fancy food choices at Phoenix Muni.  If youre not intimidated by enormous wieners, a footlong hot dog might be for you.  Believe me when I say, you will not be able to eat more than two, no matter how much you love hot dogs.  I am also a fan of the little dining area by the left field foul pole.  You can sit there at a table with a giant umbrella, hide from the sun and sip your beverage of choice.  If youre lucky, you can even watch the game from some of those seats. The people who work here, from ushers to concession stand clerks, are incredibly nice.  They really do want to make sure you have a great time at the game, and it shows. Parking here is very easy.  For $5, you can park in the lot right across the street.  The lot rarely gets full, and you can always almost find a spot.  I hear there are ways to find free parking if you are willing to walk a little more, but at $5, why would you?  Its important to know, though, that the walk from the lot ""across the street"" from the ballpark will take you about 7 minutes.  There is no crosswalk on the street, and you have to use that ridiculous pedestrian bridge they erected with the sole purpose of annoying most baseball fans. So, +1 star for great seats, +1 star for cheap parking, -1 star for horrible scoreboard, -1 star for the pedestrian bridge.  A-OK, 3 stars."
2,"I travel a lot for business and usually stay in Hampton Inns.  This one less than impressed me.  First and foremost, it is a motel.  The door to the rooms open to the outside, which is not typical of a Hampton Inn. I was concerned to stay in such a hotel at first since I am a woman traveling alone.  The area is ok, and the hotel area seems to be pretty safe and well lit. The lobby and pool area are very pretty, but again...the doors open to the outside so when I was positioned right near the pool, I could hear everything that went on.  The bed was standard Hampton Inn bed (comfy) but the room was small.  My biggest complaint, by far, is how bad the noise carries.  Im still sitting in the room and I can hear the entire conversation going on next door...I can make out every single word.  Additionally, I can hear the person upstairs.  Their sound insulation is terrible.  There is a gap around my door (and remember, it opens to the outside) so can hear everything that goes on outside, too.  Theyve done a nice job of spiffying it up, but I did not find it to be appropriate for a business traveler."
4,We had a great meal here! I started with the cheap salad as I was craving salad.  HIt the spot. Hubby started with smashed irishman drink and loved.  He moved onto a draft beer. I moved onto Fish and Chips-they were light and just the right size. Hubby had beef stroganoff-he said it was tasty. We ended with the fabulous salted caramel-my fav thing of the night. I think the bill was $62 before tip-pretty reasonable to me.
3,"The service was great! We had a large group & had called prior to make a reservation. Our table was ready when we arrived & they had assigned 2 servers. They were both incredibly pleasant & attentive. Our food came out really quickly & no one had any complaints. I wouldnt say this was authentic Mexican food, but it doesnt have to be. A good time was had by all :)"
4,"This was my first time to Sekong By Night.  I have had Khmer food before, which is ironic, as my wife is from Vietnam, but never had Khmer food from Cambodia.  She has to come to the USA to experience Khmer food!!  I have eaten Khmer food in San Francisco CA, and in Siem Reap. Both my wife and I were pleasantly surprised with Sekong By Night.  It looks like a tiny little forgettable restaurant from outside on the street, but once you step inside. you can see the owner put some thought into the decor.  It really looks Asian.  It is as though the owner went on a shopping trip to Phnum Penh and came back with tons of artwork for the place.   The Amok fish is really nice.  Reminded me of a cafe I had dinner at in Siem Reap some 9 years ago when I was seeing Angkor.  The fish was fresh.  My wife wanted to switch with me (she ordered the Katheaw Cha).   The Katheaw Cha is also very good.   I ordered a Coconut Juice as my drink expecting it to be canned.  It was fresh, and smelled fresh (a pleasant surprise!!!) My wife ordered the Grass Jelly drink, and it was also good.   I really wish that this place was in Mesa AZ, as I would go more often.  Maybe so, I will make the drive again to this place from Mesa as appropriate.  This place was a pleasant surprise and I wish the owner great success.  I want this restaurant to succeed.   The only place where the Khmer food was better (for me) was Siem Reap, but then it is perhaps a little unfair to compare a restaurant in the USA to what really is available in Cambodia."
2,"Just not a great Sushi Roku location.  The service was okay and the ambience was too - but the food wasnt fabulous and the sushi chef knew very little of the food he was serving.  When sitting at the sushi bar in a fine dining japanese restaurant you kind of expect the chefs to be spot on and knowlegable about the food.  Not the case here.  If you want to spend this kind of money, go to Roka Akur - its fantastic and worth every penny."
2,"My wife and I were looking for a dinette table. We looked at many places and ended up at the RoomStore. We found a great table and decided to purchase the item.  The salesman was nice and didnt provide too much pressure.  There is a LARGE selection of items-couches, tables, chairs, dressers etc. My problem was that we bought the table and had a deferred pickup due to moving into a new home several weeks down the road. I placed a small down payment to reserve my item. After several weeks, I contacted the RoomStore to pick up my item since I just moved into my new home. My item was not in stock and was told to call back later in the week. I called 4 days later and was informed the item was now available.  Today, I went to pay the balance of my purchase and take home the table. Small problem, the table and chairs are not at this location.  I was given the choice to pick up the item at the distribution center 30 minutes away or wait until until Tuesday. I wish that during my several contacts during this process that someone would have told me that I wouldnt be able to pick up my item here or wait several other days. I was not happy! Now I have to go back once again to pick up the table and chairs."
5,Great food!!! The French dip is to die for!! Great Service! Clean and fancy especially for the area its located in!  Def a hidden gem! My husband and I both love going here and cant wait until next time.
5,"Humdinger!   What more is there to say.  Its the best sandwich ever.  It tastes even better on the weekends when Kids Eat FREE!  If you have a larger family ( more than 2 kids ), this is the best deli in town."
3,"The food and drinks are blah, but the service is always great! Happy hour and trivia are always fun at Skip & Jans."
5,Im usually one to prefer chicken - but when the only option for tacos is steak you go with it.  I ordered the taco and was rewarded with tender steak with lots of flavor.  Our lunch crew has gone back several times and the service is always fast and friendly.  For the size and price - order multiples.  Love the salsa bar.  Adding cucumbers is now my favorite treat.
5,"Kona grill is never a disappointment.  Sushi, the regular menu, the atmosphere.....  The staff is very friendly and the food is very good!  We like to create our own sushi dishes and the chef is always ready and willing!  I highly recommend Kona Grill for consistently good food!"
5,"A must!  One of the BEST dog food stores in the Valley!  Great service and quality, natural feed products for your dog.   You can rest at peace knowing that your pets are in GREAT hands. Mark Siebel http://www.doggiestepsdogtraining.com/"
4,"Fantastic pizza for the price! One of our favorite take-out spots. Ask for the daily special as you can usually get wings, soda and pizza for the price of a large pizza. Great deals, great prices and quick service. Not a place to go sit and eat - strictly take-out."
4,"The cookies and breakfast pastries are to die for.  Just for those two items they deserve four stars.  Everything else, however, is just OK.  The rest of their foods are good but not great.  If youve ever been to Wildflower, I think their food is better there but dang, I can go to Paradise and just pig-out on their cookies!"
3,"Dam you Doug !!! Ok, I thought I be the first but Doug beat me to it.   Any establishment that has a free happy hour for its guest is a plus nuff said. Yes -the 4th floor grill is awesome and the bar staff will give you the Ins & outs of Scottsdal-ing culture and the pizza they serve is pretty dam good- the complimentary breakfast was was actually good too.  Im not sure if they still do the free happy hour thing but what sold me on this lets say resort - is that while I was there , there was a whole bus full of girls that where promoting - some kinda of alcoholic beverage - and I heard from a good source many beverage companies uses the Chaparral as a pit stop for their promotional tours...  Word- I guess they come for the pools..."
4,Went in after a day of shopping with my mother. We walked into the bar side and decided we wanted to sit in the pew benches on the restaurant side instead. We ordered waters and sodas while munching on a side of chips. My mom got the chicken pot pie and loved the crust and the moist chicken. I got the Meat and Cheese. Although I wish the cheese was a bit more melty the sage pork sausage was great. The dipping gravy tasted of beer. Great addition. The music was fun and the bartender dancing to the music was fun. Great lunch! Will go again when Im in Tempe. Another plus: enough for left overs!
3,Cute little coffee shop. Had some tea and sat outside with my boyfriend. Enjoyed the weather and played some cards. Very relaxing.
5,"LOVE the Four Peaks. Can get crowded as hell, and parking is a bit of a cluster F, but Ive never ever not had a fun night there.  The beer is excellent, the service has always been attentive, and the food is above normal bar standards The fish and battered fries was very good, the tartar sauce is good, but ask for the cocktail sauce . . . its fantastic.  Heavy on the horseradish enough to feel it in your nose!  And the Rueben might just be the best in town. The happy hour is great.  $3 locally brewed pints?  Sign me up The location and the it being an actual brewery gives it extra points.  I had family in town this week, and I like to take out of towners to places that have a local AZ vibe.  They definitely got a taste of MY Arizona.  Next time theyll have to come during Pumpkin Porter season"
5,"Nellos is the best!  Great local feel, great food, love this place. You have to have:  (Gluten Free) Pizza, Garden Salad with Turkey and House Dressing.  It will soon be your go to feel good order."
3,"So let me start by saying the latte was very good, best Ive had in this area at least. Much better than Starbucks, even though thats not a very high standard but one that everyone can relate to.  Good atmosphere, comfortable seat and lots of it... The live music was deceiving as it looked good for the out side (dont we all) and sounded horrible (but Im not reviewing that am I) :)  I was actually helped by a guy there who matched the place well. Good service with a grin and not the overly caffeinated pep talk baristas of a certain chain often feel pressured to give. Ill be back if only for the latte."
4,"I stayed here for work and had some meetings in the area which made the location very convenient for me. I just hopped in my car and was at my office 5 minutes later. The hotel seemed pretty new-ish and there were free cookies at check in. There is also a restaurant downstairs and a gym if youre into that sort of thing. My room was clean and well kept.  My only minor complaint about the room would be that the air conditioning is super loud! There are a couple of restaurants right outside, but they close pretty early. Other than that there isnt too much close by, but if you drive up the street a few blocks to Happy Valley, you can find every big box store and chain restaurant imaginable."
4,"How this place has less than four stars is a mystery to me. I have been 5 times and have taken out of towners here 2 out of the 5 and they all left saying it was yummy too. The El Presidential Especiale is a MUST - i order 86 the onions and add machaca/shredded beef. They are a simple yummy combination with their rice and beans. This is just straight up classic mexican food - not for the snobby. So if you want a more classy joint thats less authentic - hit up ZTejas cause this place is not for you. The hot salsa in the ketchup bottles is always a sign of a great mexican joint (and its hot AND tastey - a combination not many get correct). I will say their chips can be a little on the less crunchy, more oily side but they are more than happy to replace that with some that are a little more to your liking. And their margs are delish as well. This place deserves a 4 because of consistency, friendly and accomodating atmosphere and just downright solid take on enchiladas - red sauce is spot on. Thanks Tee Pee for being our go-to for Mexican food in the Valley of the Sun!"
4,"I hate to find out that there was another location closer to where I was.  It doesnt matter because it was worth the trip.  I ordered pick up because I was by myself and wanted to a bit of exploring.  The place has a nice casual ambiance.  They also have an outdoor seating area.  I ordered the pad thai that comes with chicken and shrimp as a standard.  Since it was lunch time, it was part of the lunch menu that came with a choice of soup or salad.  I chose the soup, but was too stuffed to have it because I jumped right into the pad thai.  I ordered it medium spicy, and it was pretty spicy.  I cant imagine what hot would have tasted like.  Actually, Im more curious of what it would have tasted like in a mild flavor.  The noodles were slightly overcooked, but still flavorful.  I also had the Thai Iced Tea here, and it was perfect for the weather and a great combination with the tangy pad thai flavor.  The prices are expensive compared to Chicago, but I hear its typical for Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  My lunch speciai and drink costed me a little over $15.  I guess if you are craving it that bad like I was, youll pay the price..."
4,"4.5 Stars... I really enjoyed Becketts table! Its a large, cool looking room with exposed ceiling and brick walls. They have a small patio and I heard theyre planning to build a large patio on the side of the building.  I met a couple friends there and we shared a few different items:  The drink list has some great looking combos and a nice variety of wines. I tried the Palmaire, a lemonade/pomegranite combo. Very refreshing!  We had the grilled cheese with pancetta to start... I love a good grilled cheese and these were perfect little bites. It came with roasted red pepper tomato soup. The soup tasted like pureed roasted red peppers; I would have preferred a little more balance with tomato taste.  The roasted brussel sprouts were sumptuous; intense flavor and a little crisp on the outside.  The fire roasted green chile pork stew was very tasty. The corn bread that came with had a perfect sweet contrast. I tried a bite of my friends short rib - very tender and lean.  We ended with the creme brulee, which came with fresh blackberries. At first I passed on having bites (Im not a huge fan of creme brulee), but they pressured me into trying it... YUM! I may be a convert now.  Overall, a great pick! Shout out to Katie B. for the suggestion."
5,"Their emu oil is great.  I use it for inflammation of my jaw and shoulders, its wonderful.  I highly recommend it.  We buy it at Fresh Vitamins in Mesa.  No dyes, fully refined, I love it."
5,"We were in town on Business and Pleasure and had a chance to visit Aiellos with our Children, 10 and 7.  What a TREMENDOUS experience it was overall and then to top it all off, a chance to win ""dinner on the house"" via drawing a number out of a bucket, was simply superb.  We didnt win but will definitely come back next time we are in town as the food, staff, and overall dining experience was unbeatable!"
3,"Went here to meet up with LA friends during Superbowl weekend. The decor is pretty unique here and the bathrooms are quite the trip. Bartenders are ace, cocktail waitresses are good looking, and the music is a healthy mix of bangers and decent indie hits. Tip for the door guys there dont let in 6 dudes at a time, even if they are Persian dudes with tons of cash who want to buy bottles. Boo!"
1,"Quick spot for a mall-made mayo-based California roll. This is where you go to learn how sushi can go wrong. Youve been hard at work doing swipe-and-sign. Perhaps you even dropped a thousand bucks at Neimans on a worthless Jhane Barnes sweater and some silk-lined Zanella slacks or three thousand on a whats-left-of-last-seasons-collection of Brioni blazer. Whatever your fancy, youre toting a wrist full of roped, glossy, shooshing-sounding bags with tissue paper sticking out the tops. You just want a break and some cool refreshing sushi. Its OK, but beware. Unagi and other ""hot"" items have a ""beep-beep beep-beep"" before they get to you. California and spicy tuna rolls come real quick -- cause they come from a vat of mayonnaise. Rice is not right either. Stick to tuna and salmon sashimi and miso soup. If head chef Rick is there (think Kyoto of Empire at 24th and Camelback, then Ichi Ban, University off McClintock), ask him to make you a Fat Bob on Acid, for good ol times sake. Or just go to Starbucks, tide yourself over, and find a real sushi restaurant. And about the Brioni... Dont sweat the buyers remorse. Itll make a great tax deduction to Florences."
5,"This is an amazing taco truck just minutes from the airport. I ordered the amazing ceviche and a barbacoa burrito, while my girlfriend ordered three tacos. Ive said it before and Ill say it again here: this truck is an excellent example of the inverse correlation between price and taste in Mexican food. Eat here before your next flight!"
5,"Probably the best mall Ive ever been to. Anchored by five mega stores - Nordstrom, Nieman Marcus, Macys, Dillards and Barneys New York. Its so big, it took a couple of hours just to walk it. My wife called it the best mall shes ever been too. Nuff said."
5,"This place is absolute perfection.  From the setting to the service to the food, I loved every moment of it.  The only way I found out about this place was through Yelp.  You seriously are my trusty sidekick.  From the previous reviews I was a little worried that it might be packed, but then I remembered it was a Monday night so no worries. Walking in the restaurant, it is quite small, but just absolutely adorable.  It really does feel like an upscale country home.  Wood lines the whole restaurant and they have mini chandeliers hanging over every table.  Even the touches of place setting are just perfect. Our server was Gina and she was a complete sweetheart.  We started off with the Bohemian Sidecar and the Cucumber Vesper.  Both were absolutely delightful!  Then we moved on to appetizers, because while getting drunk is fun, I was really excited for the food.  We had the steak tartare and mussels in the saffron and white wine sauce.  I loved the steak tartare with the potato chips and fried egg on top.  Put fried egg on top of anything and Im sold.  Put fried egg on top of raw steak and Im in love!  The mussels came out just as we were finishing up the steak tartare, perfect timing!  The mussels were equally amazing if not more, and I am so sad that they only give one piece of bread!  Well that, along with the bread and butter.  But that still wasnt enough for me!  I wanted to soak up all of that saffron sauce goodness! After Gina cleared that out of our way, she brought out the glass of Bordeaux and Rhone blend.  I hate when I dont have a drink in front of me, and she made sure that never happened.  Then the entrees came.  The pork shoulder with the bacon for my bf, and the stuffed chicken with the pome puree and mushrooms for me.  Again, absolute perfection on both accounts!  I loved the mushrooms that were slightly charred and crispy, with the sauce and the puree and the chicken with goat cheese.  Im getting hungry again just writing about it.  My bf loved his, but I still maintain that mine was better.  And both of these entrees were incredibly reasonably priced at $15 and $17.  Could life get any better? Well apparently it could!  After we polished off our entrees, then came dessert and after dinner drinks!  We had the souffle which was amazing with the creme anglaise.  And the berries with the creme fraiche.  Heaven in my mouth!  We finished that off with the chocolate martini and the pear tini. This review cannot do this place justice.  This is truly a unique experience that is far above any of the restaurants in Scottsdale.  Please go in and experience this for yourself, you will not be disappointed!"
1,After moving back to the area from Cali I needed somewhere  to get my acrylics done. I usually like to get some kind of design or unique tips. After walking in I saw some tips I liked so I decided to try out this place. The first visit was bad the nail tech would not listen to the length of nails I was requesting and did a terrible job at shaping them. I always give people more than one chance so I went back and this time I got a pedicure first then the nail tech left the salon and I sat near the dryer for 45  min before approaching the manager about the length of time I had been waiting for a fill. He replied unapologetically that the tech had to leave to pick up her son from school... I sat another 15 min before I was seen by someone else. They also did a poor job. I will not spend my money somewhere that they do not value their customers. Not to mention they did a crap job and were overpriced when it came to designs and tips with prints on them. Dont waste your time here.
1,"I waited 45min and ended up with a tiny gross little serving of tortilla with vegetable scraps thrown in it, served in a aluminum take-out box. The tables are folding tables, like the kind you play beer pong on. And they have pictures of kids and babies on the walls and signs asking people to send in pictures of their kids for the walls too, which has nothing to do with Asian/Mexican cuisine, it creeped me out."
5,"OOOOOWWWEEEE!! Have yall tried ATL Wings yet!!! If not what are you waiting for!  They are the BOMB Diggity! I dont know why I havent updated my review either, so here I go!  The honey habanero are still my #1 but I also love the Cajun Hot!  Holy Crap!! Get some of the Cajun Hot wings and some ranch and their hot sauce on the side, dip your wing in the ranch and then the hot sauce and watch out!! The only time you really feel the burn is when youre no longer eating, gums & tongue just be blaze hot and mouth just be water for more, yes my friends thats the heat I love!! Luv me some wings from ATL!"
3,"Im always on the lookout for cool places to bring out of town friends and this place seemed to fit the bill.  Its a sustainable farm that produces Arizonas only extra virgin olive oil.  I came in for lunch and as I pulled into the GRAVEL parking lot my stomach turned because I had expensive heels on and knew they were going to take a beating (I know, ""waaah"" right? But there are women out there that love their shoes as much as I do and will appreciate the heads-up).  Once I entered the Olive Mill I was delighted to see how adorably quaint it was inside.  The building was split in two, market on one side, bistro on the other with seating in between both and also outside.  The market had testers of all their products, great idea but the food testers didnt seem sanitary so I didnt try anything.  I ended up buying some awesome hand balm that I love.  They had a really great wine selection as well.   Alright so heres the bad part.  The entire time I was there, not one employee greeted me or cracked a smile.   There was one guy in particular that was going back and forth stocking shelves and was visibly annoyed by my presence.  When I went to order my sandwich, I remembered I got a free drink with my Yelp check-in.  The girl at the counter sighed and rolled her eyes as I scrambled through my purse to find my iphone and she said ""forget it, I got it.""  Their sandwich the ""Kalamata"" had its 15 seconds of fame on the food network so I was going to get that but opted for the ""Lucca"" at the last second because it has brie...I love brie more than I love most family members.  The sandwich was a disappointment.  All the ingredients were there but it was devoid of any flavor and I couldnt figure out why.   I probably wont be bringing any of my homies here but I will drop by to buy products, I fully support local businesses."
5,"My husband and I have been going here for a few years now. It is one of our favorite places. Really low key, affordable, amazing food! Between the 2 of us our bill is never more than $10 and we are always stuffed! I love how casual it is and the humus cannot be beat!"
5,"Good reviews are easy to write. Stop reading this and just go eat there!  OK, well I have visited this place for years now and dont go anywhere else if I am in this area.  I like the Chefs, they are friendly and quick. They speak pretty good Spanish to me and but I dont dare try to respond in Japanese, ha ha.  The value is phenomenal, where can two people get miso soup, salad, beans, tea, ice cream and sushi rolls all for under $20?  Ive tried the same at Say Sushi in my hometown of Maricopa and cant do it for under $40 or more for two.  All you can eat is available but I find that ordering individually is more economical.  Great atmosphere for a quick lunch or a large party for dinner.  The waitresses are Asian and I find that suitable for the restaurant. Some reviews on here complain about them. I dont have any issue with them they have always treated me nice and done their job well.  I will keep coming back."
3,"I love that walking through the doors of the Sugar Bowl is like taking a step back in time but what I dont love is that it looks like it hasnt been cleaned or had any restoration work done since the day it opened. Lets be honest though, I didnt come here for the decor, I came for the ice cream.  I was very excited when I saw the sundae covered in chocolate, cherries and marshmallow creme. I love marshmallow creme and chocolate, always a recipe for success when these two ingredients are combined. Well, no luck. They were out of marshmallow creme. I got a brownie sundae instead, only ate half and decided that it was only ok.  I probably wont go back to this place. There are too many good dessert options out there. Though if my friends insisted, I would more than likely oblige."
5,"I have been coming to Lux for years ever since I started graduate school here in AZ.  What is there to say that hasnt already been said other than hands down it is my go-to coffee spot in Arizona.  Such a warm and diverse group of people, rotating artwork, the perfect study music playing in the background (although it is played a bit loud), espresso roasted on-site and baked goods made on-site.  Always find an excuse to end up there for a café au lait or a velvet if I have a sweet tooth!"
4,"As a vegetarian and sporadic health nut, I just love TJs. They have a nice array of inexpensive fresh produce, including my beloved broccolini, for 40% of what Safeway charges. Huge selection of frozen veggie-friendly dinners, good for my on-the-go household. Greek yogurt, cheap. Nice beer selection with lots of cheapo wine. I try to buy all my supplements here too, as they seem to be a lot less expensive. Yes, Im all about saving cash on groceries and whatnot. The downside? Its not one-stop-shopping; a trip always requires supplementation with another trip to a ""regular"" grocery store. This particular TJs is teeny-tiny-small, and always chock-full of obnoxious and/or oblivious people who wield carts like weapons. My favorite is the woman who thinks its an awesome time to teach little Jimmy how to push his own wee cart and comparison shop, and lets the little bastard cruise all over the store willy-nilly. Im all for giving your kid responsibility, but a) you still have to, you know, keep an eye on the kid and b) a super-crowded claustrophobic nightmare like this place after work is not, repeat, NOT the time to do so."
4,"Perfect patio for a Saturday! This place walks a fine line between being too snooty and being just plain awesome.  Ive had a couple of experiences here, and overall the food is really tasty.  Im a fan of the gnocchi, even though its a little different than traditional gnocchi. The location is great, as long as there isnt a douche bag convention going on, and as long as the bartenders and servers keep their positive attitudes, I think this place will be around for a while. Thanks!"
5,"The food in this place is indescribably awesome! Granted, the place could be nicer, but if youre in the mood for great food without the frills of a great looking place: this is it. The service is fast, friendly, and the prices are great- especially knowing that their portions are typically huge. I cant finish my plate most of the time, so I always end up taking leftovers home.  I love their Jade Red Chicken, as well as their emerald chicken. Their black beans are to die! Order a combo plate, if this is your first time here. Youll get a good mix of everything and youll leave without regrets!"
5,"What can I say... we eat here once a week for lunch cuz we can walk here. We come here for happy hour twice a week cuz we can walk here.  So, yeah its pretty convenient... but we STAY here after hours to play poker because the servers know us by name and the food is priced right and the poker crowd is really cool and its a great place to eat-n-learn. And we LOVE Tony because that guy says hello to EVERY CUSTOMER EVERY TIME.  Trust me on this one... jump off the freeway for happy hour... youll know what I mean when Tony says hello to you, too. PS get the three meat calzone. You look great and can afford the calories..."
4,"Love this place. Actually, today was awesome, because they usually only offer the ""express dozen"" through the drive thru, and the kids didnt want to go in, so the dude behind the speaker actually fulfilled my order as I wanted. The only thing that bugs the hell out of me is that they charge for 2 donuts when you get a long john. :-("
5,"I Felt a sin coming on .......  if i could give 10 stars i would !!!! Let me set the scene for you of this Kazilicious Sunday night ..... We enter through  a solid planked door set in the rear ...(oh yes the truth is inside) candlelit passageway leads you into a sexy,sultry stone interior that is softened by the plush seating , dim lighting ,wine barrels .. i give his hand a squeeze and smile because we have hit the mother load within this sinfully sexy speakeasy .The Tuscan colors coupled with the stone ..deep ,rich ,decadent !!! His hand on the small of my back as we approach our seats as the intimacy and ambiance takes hold . A bowl of olives, 3 cheese fondue with apple ,the Tuscany pizza ....sexy damn noshes ..they know what they are doing here ..soft ...firm....dip....bite ..yesssss SO beyond sexy here..... Oh and the wine ,nectar of the gods, sign of fertility , here in this setting it is like Ambrosia ,and your inner God or Goddess will surely blossom ,and romance will bloom .... It seems like thousands of labels here - we went with the  M. Chapoutier Le Sizeranne 98 ....Heady ,earthy ,smoky ,deep ,sweet and ripe .the smell of currants and berries .lovely texture ,full bodied .....DIVINE ! let the flirting begin ..coy toying of the glass stem ..sweet smiles ..love words escaping on a whisper  between sips. We spent around $200 ,worth every penny in my opinion . Prior to the Kaz , the Rokerij was just about the sexiest spot to me in the valley ...these two must share the crown . So to recap ; SEXY, SULTRY,SEDUCTIVE !!!!! posh,swank ... Good Service , lush wine selection ,yummy tidbits ... Ambiance up the wazoooo . A heady experience ..this is where lovers go ,a prelude to the interlude of love !"
5,"I love Gabriel. He does an amazing job every single time Im there. I generally get two peekaboo highlights put in, and a cut and style, and always leaving looking great. His attitude is always upbeat, it would be impossible to spend any time in his chair and not leave in a good mood. The salon is always clean and comfortable. I never feel like Im being forced into spending more money or buying product, but when I have a question about what I should be using in my hair Gabe always makes excellent suggestions. I have recommended him a good friend and my mother and both love him. My mother even left her stylist of 10 years to start going to him because of the excellent service he provides."
4,Great food at a great price. Not the best Italian food but definitely a step up from all of the national chains. Also great lunch prices
2,"My favorite thing about this place is the decor. It is crazy beautiful. I also like that you can get better than average bar food until late and there are so many places to sit, youll never have an issue with waiting. Their food is okay, but nothing spectacular.  I used to live in Arcadia, and I miss it every day. If I were to move back to Phoenix/Scottsdale- I would never even consider a different neighborhood. Across the board, it is the friendliest and most beautiful neighborhood in Maricopa County. That being said- The Vig represents the lame element of the neighborhood. People with too much money and bad taste. I think someone else called it ""schmoozy"" and thats exactly it! As a neighbor, we usually rode our bikes- so I cant speak to parking. Do they not still have the shuttle? Give me The Great Escape, JTs or Postinos any day."
5,"Every time I go in this place its always a great experience.  My wife and I have been going to Lucilles pretty much every other Sunday for the last couple months.  Her favorite is the pulled pork mine is the Kansas City ribs, but we always have to start our meal off with the fried pickles.  If youre on a tight budget even buying one meal and sharing it is a definite option.  Sometimes I get full on the biscuits and spread the provide in the beginning. The bar area is a great place to have a meal and watch a game.  I would highly recommend this establishment to any of my friends.  But make sure you get the fried pickles... you will not be disappointed. Oh yeah.....please please please order the Mac N Cheese as your side.  You will thank me later. Q"
4,"Lunchtime out with a relative on a weekday, and La Condesa has a seat by the window. There is really nothing like its saloon-artsy walls for us to gaze.   The Dia De los Muertos motif and wooden furniture make it perfect for easy conversation.   Most folks seated around us already know where to go for lunch thats not too pricey and homemade.   The Horchata is nothing short of liquid dessert, filled with pecans, fruit and rice milk.  You can avoid dairy all together with this and a special bullet burro with guac and lettuce. The salsa bar sets the standard for good restaurants.  Its wide variety of salsas leave little doubt what creative people run the place.  My hope is that only a few people read this and try it. Otherwise, to my chagrin, the next time we park on 16th Street, we may have to WAIT in a line outside."
4,"I adore Radio Milano. Tried to hit it up this last Thursday evening and found it to be closed. I was really depressed by this as I have had my eye on the deviled eggs and the beautiful bartender boy the last couple of times Ive dined here. (neither of which Ive been able to try yet...booooo!!)  According to the valet guy across the street at Postino they are scheduled to re-open in early April. Apparently with somewhat more of a ""lounge like"" feel or some such nonsense. Works for me!  I hope they keep the Tuna Crudo around which is just insanely good. Drown yourself in some chocolate pudding for desert, you wont regret it. Ahhhhh, now Im hungry... dont worry about me, he was too pretty to be straight anyway."
2,"Weve been here several times with our kids and grandkids.  Its a good family spot, but the service is just okay.  We love the fresh chips, and the wings are good.  Salads are meh.  Well come again because its a good spot for the kids, but well come expecting not great service."
4,"Most of my excitement and ""love"" of this place has more to do with what it represents -- not what it is right at this second, but I fully expect that to get better. TFM representing a place in Central Tempe to get basic groceries (all the better that theyre local and organic!) without needing access to a car.  When I looked up the location, I felt heartsick at the thought that this is right across the street from where the Co-Op used to be. Whats there now? An empty dirt lot. The Co-Op was driven out by an over zealous real estate company that, in the boom of condo building, bought the location, driving Co-Op to another spot where it eventually failed. Know what else failed? That condo endeavor. Now, a few years later, we have this budding marketplace with a lot to live up to. My first trip in, I didnt have anything particular I needed, I just wanted to check things out (though I was making enchiladas later that day, so had a few items I was on the look-out for).  Its pretty small right now, and in the former building of Jakes Shop, which is also another Tempe staple now gone. But it had the basics such as milk, peanut butter, a small selection of produce -- local, of course -- cheese and even some gift-type items for sale in the back.  I picked up some green onions (99 cents for a bunch) and red peppers ($1.29/ea), and thought those prices were exact with a chain grocery. And bread - this is my favorite part of the store! A big selection of sliced wheats and grains, and rolls and longer Ciabatta styles too. And the favorite of my favorite? Fresh ""Made this morning!"" tortillas! They looked delicious, and were HUGE. The size of a large pizza, they came in flavored varieties for making yummy wraps. When I checked out ($5 minimum for credit card purchases, and a sign said ""EBT coming soon""), I was offered another red pepper from a basket by the register because this small batch was about to go bad. So instead of letting them and then throwing them away, they *give* them away with each purchase - wonderful!  Oh, and I was surprised and pleased to see a small corner of the store set up with a couple small tables and a couch, all within view of a large flat screen playing Alice in Wonderland. Sure enough, a kid sat there, out of the way and quiet, while is parents shopped. Both parents and the childless thank the owners for THAT kid haven, Im sure. I really look forward to coming in again and again and watching this place grow and thrive. p.s. I highly recommend becoming a fan of their FB page, so you can get daily info about what they just got in, specials, new additions, etc."
1,"Overcrowded, sprawling mess of a mall (and I normally like malls). Traffic and parking are almost as bad as at Tempe Marketplace. The confusing layout makes it hard to find specific stores (even with the help of the directories)."
5,"This review pertains to carnitas, and as such should not be taken as a suggestion for ordering any of the following: fish tacos, rice, beans, horchata. Thats about it! Yum!"
2,"We went here for the fabulous UYE. As the restaurant is often empty, Julia though it would be good to give them some business...but in the end it was our group that ended up being given the business. The words highway robbery come to mind, but I guess we werent really on the highway. The prices listed on the menu really didnt seem that out of line, a bit on the pricey side but nothing alarming. Our waitress slyly sold us a kazillion dollars worth of appetizers that were not on the menu. We got 4 plates which consisted of 4 individual sauces with some stuff in them...one had shrimp, one had chicken, one had pork, and one had chihuahua. Oh wait, I think that was the cheese on top. Anyway, the plate with 4 tablespoons of sauce was not worth the $25...oh wait, we got 4 of them. The waitress also managed to slip two orders of guacamole in on us for $11 a piece. As far as the entrees are concerned, the portions were small and the food was kind of meh. The mole was way too sweet for my taste. The biggest bummer of all was NO BOOZE! The $120 worth of appetizers would have gone over much better if they were washed down with some frosty margaritas. A couple of pitchers and they could have slipped us some $100 flan. Regardless of the price and the mediocre food, it was well worth going for the amazing company of the awesome Phoenix Yelpers. I dont think I would go back for the food though."
4,First time impressions are the most important and Culinary Dropout made an ever lasting one. Everything from the service to the food was spot on perfect. The whole experience was so good that its hard to believe it will be the same when I go back.  I hope it is............
1,"Price reflects quality and service.  5/2010 purchased wedding gown, brides maids and mothers (bride and groom mothers and grandmothers) dresses.  Girls were rude and our brides maids dresses seems and straps fell apart just before the wedding."
5,"One of my top choices for downtown Phoenix. Always an upscale, posh vibe, but with very generous prices on entrees. Good looking people throughout this bar.  The Kisras are VERY tasty and a good spin off the typical flatbreads at many restaurants now.  Brunch here on Saturdays or Sundays-- great drink specials too."
2,"I came in here wanting and expecting this place to be amazing.  I wanted this place to be 5 stars. ugh, I feel like a failure for giving it 2.  Ive heard such good things about this place, and was expecting it to be good, but unfortunately, it was not.  :-( I walked in and placed my order.   The menu seems to be decent enough, with a fair amount of selection.  Ample amounts of toppings, and you can have your burger a few different ways. Mind you, Im a burger lover, so Im always up for places like this. I ordered a regular burger with all the fixings and BBQ sauce on top.  I got the fries too.  It came in a brown bag..I guess thats how they serve it regardless if you eat in or not. I was dissappointed with the burger itself.  It seemed like it came with way to much topping. I mean, like an overwhelming amount.  I ate it, and the burger was okay, but not as good as I have experienced at other comparable places.  I wasnt looking to be ""blown away"" by the burger, but I wasnt really impressed over all.  It wasnt that great, to much on the toppings, and it didnt really do much for me.  I will say tho, you get a TON of fries tho. I left feeling underwhelmed, and dont know that I will be back in the future."
4,Great service and delicious breakfasts!
4,"Same great Lolos fried chicken and waffles without the risk of getting stabbed or shot... and it WAS worth the risk to visit their South Phoenix location on occasion. The food is that good, it might even be the ultimate in comfort food! Lucky for us they have a new Scottsdale location where the most dangerous situation you could encounter might be a hungover Scottsdale ""clubber"" (who could scratch you with their Ed Hardy bling). The only suggestion I have for them is to drop the prices about 25%"
4,"My friend who I was visiting and I went here for a fundraiser type of a deal.  I dont know what I was expecting but I really liked the island concept of the place.  My friend recommended a salad and I got a Caribbean chicken salad with some sort of coconut rice, chicken,  oranges, pineapple, tortilla strips, etc.  Well, the salad was huge!!!  The honey lime dressing was very flavorful and complimented the salad well.  We shared the rumbi fries, which were a combination of sweet and regular fries, and as aforementioned in some other reviews, I love the sweet potato fries and wish they all could have been that (do I sound like the Beach Boys?).   The decor was pretty cute and the music was great (Marley, Buffett type stuff).  The rice bowls looked fantastic, as did the sandwiches.  The prices were pretty good, considering the amount of food you received."
5,"Dr. Ellis is compasionate, caring, and really demonstrates his passion for what he does. The entire staff made us feel comfortable from the moment we walked in to the time we left the office. They went the extra step to make sure my 5 year old was having fun at the dentist! I would recommend this office to anyone who has children. Dr. Ellis and his team are the best!"
5,"Id been hearing about Defalcos for a while now. My husband, Jim W, and my youngest, Abby, raved. ""Best steak grinda since Baston,"" they said. So, on an expedition to get more raw chocolate, we went. The first thing I noticed was that the tables were scattered among the racks of Italian foodstuffs. I loved that. The place screamed ""Boston"" from the moment we walked in the door. When we ordered, Jim found one of my favorite types of soda in the case, Doc Browns diet black cherry. I was in heaven. So we got our number and sat down. While we were waiting - a short wait - I got a brilliant idea which solved a long-vexing problem. Guess it was the east coast vibe. The food came and I was in heaven. We split a steak sandwich and red potato salad. Jim likes everything and I just like onions so they gave him the mushrooms and peppers on the side. Lots of mushrooms and peppers. It didnt look like a ton of food but we certainly got enough to eat. Whats not to like at Defalcos? The food is fabulous, the prices are good, the people are really nice, and they have all kinds of imported goodies. So I guess the only thing I didnt like about Defalcos was leaving."
5,"Went wed nite, wife tells me best gnocchi since Europe, were cooked perfectly . I had pollo erbe, terrific.  "" wine tasting director"" very good, with tasty selections. Will be back, OFTEN. Highly recommend. Rich D"
5,"I had a great experience with this company today.  They sent out their tech Steve to fix my Samsung tv.  He arrived on time and was able to quickly diagnose and fix the problem.  He also provided some helpful tips to improve the performance of the tv in other areas unrelated to the issue. The service was professional, prompt, and efficient.  I would definitely use them again in the future."
1,"After reading all the good reviews, we were looking forward to eating here, but we were a bit apprehensive due to the couple of bad reviews because of the smell. Bummer...the smell just killed it for us right from the get go. Immediately, upon walking in the door, the pungent smell of backed up sewer hit us like a ton-of-bricks. We did a 180 and walked right out. No way I could sit through a meal here while breathing that funk.  Get the smell worked out and we will give you another shot, Tasty Thai."
5,"Had to update because weve now tried the pizza! For all the times we have visited weve never tried a pizza (too many other really good options to choose I guess...) We ordered the Italian Classic (veggies & meat). We ordered it a little well done/crispy and were not disappointed! It was hot, fresh and cooked perfectly!  Service was great as usual even though they were completely SLAMMED with customers the day before Thanksgiving filing numerous growlers of their pumpkin beer which sold out in less than record time! We were there again last weekend for the football games and made it in time to order our favorite breakfast items - eggs benedict and the braised pork dish with beans, potatoes, two eggs and fresh warm tortillas.  It was fantastic! This dish, just like many others (possibly ALL others) is plenty for 2 to share.  Service was exceptional and the crowd fun and rowdy rooting for their teams and AZ won - so there were a lot of happy customers that day!"
2,"So, I went because of all the hype. Immediately, realized how overrated it was. The ambiance is like a Chilis but trying to be mexican."
4,I loved it. The salad bar is not so great but everything else is excellent!
5,"They had Kool Aid! i was so happy to see it :) The chicken and waffles were really good... my girlfriend and I went straight there from the airport, before going to our hotel, and it was completely worth it...  yeah, waiting outside in 100 degree heat isnt ideal, but for 10 minutes you can deal with it... especially when they had someone outside giving out water If youre ever in Phoenix like us, or live out there, definitely stop in!!!"
1,"Went last night to Whore Foods to get basics to make pizza with, most clutch to the process was a three pack of yeast. Low and behold, the dirty hippie kids they have working there again didnt put something in the bag. And this time it was the yeast. I love the food there, but the employees are nothing more than entitled hippie kids from Scottsdale who cant be bothered to do their goddamn jobs! I am so sick of this crap with this corporation. Maybe its a Phoenix thing, or maybe its the hiring and firing processes of Whore Foods, but I am done shopping at any Whore Foods. In a place like Phoenix, where you have alternatives such as Sprouts, youd think Whore Foods would smarten up. Or when you try to ask someone who works here where something is, and they just walk by with their nose high in the air. I understand its important to show your fellow dirt merchants that youre a super star, but I dont work with you, I contribute to your salary and over inflated set of benefits for a grocery clerk, so do your goddamn job. Useless little girl in need of a shower and orthodontist.  But alas, Whore Foods and its dirty hippie employees have alienated yet another person with a job and a degree into hating everything that place stands for. Oh yea, one other thing, take the concealed firearm prohibition off of your stores. It didnt stop Jared Loughner from doing something horrid, and all it does is alienate law abiding citizens from their Constitutional rights. I understand you think that only parts of the Constitution should apply, but honestly I think you need to pull your collective heads out of your ass and take a shower. Useless motherf*&#$@s!"
1,"I recently had a shit cleaned at the Intercontinental Hotel in Hong Kong. Not cheap. I only mention that because this place charged MORE to clean that suit - almost $30 for a two-piece suit after they tacked on their $6 ""designer brand"" surcharge (no, I am not kidding). Despite branding as ""green"" the suit still reeked of solvent (the green, silica-based solvents have never left an odor in my experience). No differentiation to justify these absurd prices - a lot of good alternatives in the area. Be warned!"
4,"This would typically be a 3 star review, but it gets another star for the following: * Great air conditioning * Arizonas only Neiman Marcus * Hilarious people watching * Great happy hour haunts in the basement * Everyone here has a better tan than I do   Scottsdale Fashion Square is large and in charge and is definitely a sprawling spectacle to see at least once.   Theres no denying that its a local institution -- even if the store mix is a bit too pricey and exclusive for some."
3,"I usually get the Arizona Smashchicken or the Arizona Cobb Salad.  Both are always delicious!  Sometimes they are really spicy and other times not so much.  I guess it depends on who is making it and how many jalapenos get in there.   The chicken is really flavorful, unlike a lot of other chicken sandwiches/salads where the chicken is bland and adds nothing to the meal.  I think I am the only person I know that isnt a fan of the Smashfries.  They are generally tasty, but I would far prefer regular fries.  I really like this place, but its a little pricey for what you get.  Lunch for two will probably set you back a least $20... its not too bad, but your $20 will go a lot further other places."
5,"Always consistent. Great service, great carne asada and a pleasant patio on a beautiful day."
5,"Bad ass, just like the name.  Ive heard that this facility doesnt have any water restrictions so their course is lush & in tip top shape.  Its definitely a challenging course.  The staff is nice and the current off season rate is  $35 for residents!  You have to check it out, its a great deal."
3,"On a recent visit to Arizona, my mother and I ventured into this store. Neither of us had stepped foot in it before, even though she lives a mile away.  The aisles are broken out by cuisine, and the selection was awesome.  I was particularly surprised by the Holland, Dutch, Brazilian, and British aisle, in market classified as Asian. Very unexpected. I bet they would be more business if they boasted to be more international.  I really liked this place, but the word needs to get out about Lee Lees.  If more people shop, they will restock their shelves more often, and most items wont be so close to their expiration date.  Final points: - check expiration dates before purchasing - Generally clean but the shelved items needed to be dusted and straightened, especially the aisle with dishes. They were all over the place and had to hunt for matching bowls.  Its a market, not a dollar store - If you can get past the initial fish smell, you wont be disappointed."
4,"In my book Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks are on the top tier of the coffee shop pyramid. Because this Dunkin Donuts is a couple hundred feet north of Starbucks in this Wal-Mart power center, this location is the opportune review to compare the strengths and weaknesses of each chain using characteristics of these locations. FOOD    Dunkin Donuts blows Starbucks out of the Phoenix Valley when it comes to food. Whereas I am a fan that goes back to my teen years of Dunkin Donuts toasted bagels with cream cheese, I regard Starbucks bagels as filler food that tastes equivalent to a supermarket bagel. Dunkin Donuts signature donuts are the bomb. Starbucks pastries are filling yet forgettable. COFFEE     Long before Starbucks landed on New York soil in the 90s, Dunkin Donuts coffee was the ultimate cup of Joe. In a way Dunkin Donuts is still the ultimate cup of Joe. In my mind their coffee is slightly better than Starbucks. Especially with their added light blueberry syrup. PRICE    Dunkin Donuts coffee is relatively the same price as Starbucks. Whether I buy a coffee with syrup or ice blended coffee beverage at Dunkin Donuts or Starbucks, the difference in price is relatively zilch. SERVICE    Dunkin Donuts trails behind Starbucks in service. Especially at these locations. At Dunkin Donuts, one man was manning the shop. If there was a rush in business, this would cause customer service issues. On the other hand Starbucks had a crew of employees. The woman who took my order was very charming and friendly. Dunkin Donuts service does have one advantage over Starbucks, which is the employees put in the cream and sugar for you. COFFEE SHOP EXPERIENCE   As far as a place to hang out, Dunkin Donuts trails far behind Starbucks. This is another Dunkin Donuts where the subliminal message is to sip your coffee eat your food and move on. Starbucks on the other hand promotes hanging out with complimentary WiFi and comfortable seating."
5,"Fuego Bistro is one of my new favorites! A couple people have recommended it to me, so my boyfriend and I decided to try it for restaurant week.  We arrived about 15 minutes before our reservation to have a drink on the patio. The staff was super welcoming and friendly. Matt enjoyed a mai tai and I had a red sangria - both very refreshing. Our table was ready right on time and we had an awesome waitress who gave great suggestions on ordering... there were so many good looking options on their restaurant week menu. Were sharers, so we ordered with that in mind.  Drinks:  We got the pomegranate mojito (very refreshing) and a peach-blood orange mojito (sweet, but very good) Starters:  Signature empanadas: Tasty. The focus was the meat, I would have preferred more vegetables inside. Sauteed prawns: The star here were the sauces - delicious! Entrees:  Cola Braised Short Ribs: AMAZING! Some of the best weve ever had. The short ribs were very tender and not fatty at all. The flavor was so good! Pernil Asado (shredded pork): So delicious!! I made little tacos with their fresh corn tortillas.  Sides:  Green chili cornbread casserole: A little drier than I had imagined, but great flavor.  Maple chiliglazed carrots: The glaze didnt really stand out to me, but good as far as baby carrots go. Jalapeno creamed corn: I was pleasantly surprised - really enjoyed this one!  Chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes: A great side with the short rib.  Dessert: (By this point, we knew wed need to be rolled out of the restaurant, but we HAD to have dessert since it was part of restaurant week).  Chocolate chip bread pudding: Really good chocolate chip bread with scoops of malted chocolate crisp ice cream. This was a lot of food after that meal, but I savored the bites I had. The ice cream was excellent! Banana burrito: exactly what youd picture with scoops of the same icecream - delicious!  I cant wait to go back to Fuego and tell my friends about it. Great service, charming atmosphere, and excellent dishes.... Fuego is a winner!"
4,"Food is great.  Best Thai in West Valley.  Always get takeout so not sure about the service, but takeout is always ready when they say it will be ready.  The atmosphere is quiet and cozy - about a dozen to fifteen tables or so.  Place always seems clean when I pick my food up and has the type of decor youd expect to see in a Thai restaurant.   I usually get red chicken or beef curry hot, and my wife gets green curry mild.  The food is excellent.  Their egg rolls arent very greasy like most places.  Spring rolls are also made fresh to order with fresh veggies.  The only thing is, sometimes the spiciness of the curry will be spicier some days and not as spicy others.  Other than that, this place is great."
4,"I am so sorry I didnt come here sooner! This is a great sports bar not far from our house. The service was very friendly, and the killer wings (they also have honey BBQ) were awesome. They had tons of meat on them, which isnt always the case with wings, as I am sure most of you can attest. We also had the margherita pizza, which was pretty tasty. There were numerous TVs scattered throughout the restaurant, and they had $1 beers (yes $1) when we were there - fantastic deal! This place is definitely more chill than Fox Sports Grill (not quite as fancy or upscale), but its a perfect sports watching or beer drinking venue nonetheless.  Oh, and they deliver!!!!!! Good choice if you live in North Scottsdale."
1,"Heres the 1. 2. 3... 1. Great Food. I love hot New Mexico style food. Good job. 2. They have a little brewery and make 3 house beers. Unfortunately, theyre all shitty. 3. They could REALLY improve the service. No Bueno!  Well be back for the food. It might be take out next time though! 4-17-11 Update: Some asshole who was clearly affiliated with Arribas contacted me via private message to slam me for my review. I hope the yelp police find you and pull you off the site. More importantly, I hope more people read my review and stay away from this restaurant. Good Food folks, just get it to go! To Bryan L. and the rest of the gang over at Arribas....Go EFF yourselves! You get one star and NO more of my money!!!!!!! Learn how to work, Kid!"
1,"The office space, layout, presentation gets 5 stars, the customer service you receive from the employees at Corporate Office Center is a negative 10. They will scare your clients off, scare your own staff and make your life a living hell. Their office locations and space is beautiful but if a say, a client shows up at a time other than their scheduled time, they will be told to leave. They will be told you dont provide any services at the locations and if anyone could single handedly ruining your professional image, Corporate Office Centers can do this for you! BE AFRAID!!!! They are dedicated to working against, not with you."
4,"Its usually a ghost town at the downtown Phoenix bars, but when a game and/or concert is happening, suddenly the bars are bustling. Such was the case last night at Majerles, former Phoenix Suns player Dan Marjerles sports bar. With the Beyonce concert across the street at the arena AND a D-backs game at the ball park, Phoenix was a hoppin. My friend and I stopped into Majerles, which Ive been to a few times before, for dinner and drinks before going to see Beyonce. I had a cheeseburger and Cesar Salad. While I realize its hard to mess up a Cesar Salad, my salad was seriously the best Cesar Ive ever had. And my burger was packed with flavor. No wonder AOL  named them Best Burgers two years in a row. We also had a wonderful chocolate martini (with Vanilla Vodka, not creme based) here. And on Fridays if youre in the mood to really start the night, the bar offers a Corona or Pacifico with a shot of tequila for $7 as part of their Sizzlin Friday special. My only complaint was that our waitress suddenly went M.I.A for about 15 minutes when we were trying to close our tab so we could go to the show.  But Im still going to cut them some slack because this is one of a few fun places to drink in the downtown area. HOT TIP: A second Majerles will be opening in Chandler in the fall."
4,Decent BBQ food but nothing to scream about... but be prepared to have a TON of food to eat.
5,"Wine, booze and cigars. And friendly staff. Theres not much else that needs to be said. Oh and great prices. The selection and prices they offer are great. The aisles are wide and clearly marked. The cigar room has a great selection as well and the prices are low."
4,"After my sixth or so visit here at Big Earls I have to give them a four plus rating. My first time here was opening night and it was ok...the second time was improved...third time good...etc. Now when I come in the smoke is starting to impermiate in the walls leaving a wonderful smokey resonance in the dining room, and the food has become exponentially better!!! I am like most people in the serious dining population, a lover of all things pork. And while they do some real good pig here, I am thrice impressed with the beef offerings! I like to judge a restaurant on the dishes I would absolutely return for, and the brisket is for sure that item here. Actually, the beef ribs are also one of those ""return for"" items as well. They, much like the brisket, are perfectly smokey, wonderfully seasoned, and impossibly tender. I highly suggest either one. As for the sides, I can honestly recommend the collards, potato salad, and the Mac and cheese...although its not a creamy Mac, but it is gooey enough to pass my palates stamp of approval.  A huge selling point for me when I dine out are the drink specials, or selection. They are GREAT here!!! Being a total whisky slut, I am in heaven here, with dozens of delicious options, and the handful of beers on tap here make me happy for the change in libation after a few too many. Try the front porch cocktail, one of my top five here in town. Big Earls has proven that with time, all things become better. Like I said before, each separate visit has been more fulfilling than the last. I can only imagine how the experience will be, come summer and autumn, my guess is pretty damn amazing!"
4,The food was good and all prepared as I waited.  Looks like a long list of wide ranging bad foods that make you feel so good!
3,"Good salad options. It is definitely tough to mess up lettuce and veggies.  As for the rest of the selection, we must have just come on a bad night. The pasta was overcooked and mushy, not even close to al dente.  Fresh fruit selection consisted of only 3 fruits, not exactly a vast selection.  If you want a good salad, definitely the place to go."
5,"As good as all the others, and closer to home than most."
5,"I am a huge ""foodie"", from a long line of ""foodies"". I grew up living in hotels and on room service and fine dining. This is the best, very best, breakfast restaurant EVER! I have been living in Tempe for about six years now, the first two sad sad years I did not know that this wonderful place existed...after my first visit, this is my go-to, best place to recommend, favorite breakfast place to eat at! If you go on a Sunday, it will be very very busy. Everyone is super friendly. The place is very clean. Prices are amazing! Cheaper or as cheap as the nasty breakfast places or fast food. Huge portions and great quality food. I have never had a bad experience here, and to be honest...even if I did, I wouldnt care. I feel like home here. Everything on the menu is delicious! Ive tried almost everything. Here are a few of my favorites (dont forget though, I love it all) : OPear Grenache Omelette, Greek Fetash Omelette, English Harvest Omelette, Huevos Con Chorizo (with scrambled eggs), and the Blueberry Hill Girdle Cakes (pancakes! you can order half an order or little ones...we always get an order to share at the table). Their potatoes are delicious and crispy, the english muffins are great and their homemade jam is absolutely amazing! I have bought many jars of their jam to give as gifts! Just delicious! I wish everyone knew about this well kept secret. DONT LISTEN TO ANY REVIEW UNDER A 5 STAR! This place is the best, bottom line. Try it. You will be hooked."
5,"We went on a Friday night and even though it is off season here, the place was packed. Never the less, the service was impeccable as always. This is our third trip here and we have never been disappointed. I had the 14 Oz. NY strip and my wife had the prime rib. Both were cooked to perfection and seasoned ever so  wonderfully! My wife tells me the horseradish is the real deal and not the runny stuff you get elsewhere...cant vouch as I hate the stuff.  From the bread to the desert, every bite was worth taking. The old time ambiance with the dark wood and red ""leather""? booths are welcoming. Its pricey and if you can ignore the geek with khakis, no socks and deck shoes ever so gently cradling his wine...(you KNOW the guy and he is everywhere) in the middle of a Phoenix summer, it is worth every single cent."
4,"Looking for something refreshing to escape this crazy AZ heat? Ritas may be your answer!  I stopped by yesterday with Lindsey F, and was pleasantly surprised by all of the unique flavors of ice and custard to choose from: Swedish Fish? Check! (and it tastes exactly like the candy).  Lemonade, Cherry, Mango? Check, Check, Check!  I ended up taking home a quart of half lemonade and half cherry.  My husband and I dug into it last night. Next time Ill have to try the custard... or perhaps the Sour Patch Kid flavor that is coming out this week!  Mmmm!"
2,I have gone here quite a few times. I like having a diner close by for breakfast and newspaper reading. But this one is always short staffed. And there doesnt seem to be much management around to smooth things out. Food is usually good but staff always seems stressed out. May be due to serving hoards of poor tipping elderly.
4,"This place has apparently been open for about 2-3 weeks.  I headed here with some co-workers for a late Friday ""meeting"".  Otherwise known as happy hour!  They have a good selection of beer on draft and bottle.  I had a New Belgium Super IPA that they had on draft and one of their sausages(Chicken and Apple) topped with some sauerkraut and mustard.  It was quite a good combination and was recommended by our server. If youre looking for food, then you may be disappointed in the small amount of options, however, when you realize that their kitchen is the size of a small closet, it kind of makes sense.  With the cooler weather right on the horizon here in the valley, their very large patio area should come in quite handy. I will definitely try them out again."
4,"WOWSA- we just moved here from NYC and this pizza is like home :)  We tried the Brooklyn and Da Works  pies and the Brooklyn was WAY BETTER. I didnt like the Da Works (dont care for fresh tomatoes on top of my pizza).   This will be our regular pizza joint for the area- we were both impressed and will order many more Brooklyn pizzas from NYPD! Having just moved from NYC we can speak with authority when we say ""Its authentic NY pizza!"""
3,"Gracies is a small thrift store with decent items.  The prices are a little less than you would pay at Goodwill.  You can get a pair of jeans for about $5.  If you need a belt, this would be a good place to go, only $2.  I didnt find anything to buy for myself, but we found a new pair of shorts for my son.  Only $2.50.   Just an FYI, it costs $0.75 to use your debit card."
5,"New owners are awesome!!!!!  Good people, earnest in providing a great product with great service.  The restaurant is beautiful too.  My mouth starts watering right when I walk in the door.  Go check them out!!!!"
5,"Lives up to the local fuss. Quick, cheap, tasty and one of the few fast Mexican food restaurants that utilize yellow cheese, which is my cardinal rule of good Mexican food."
5,Apparently fellow yelper Andrew and I are meeting in our dreams over maple bacon creme brulee! Im seriously glad to see that I am not the only one having subconcious yearnings for this lil dab of heaven in a cup! All of the products are top notch though and who doesntlike creme brulee? Communists maybe? Chef Eric is awesome and so friendly too.
4,Just got back from Carlsbad Tavern.  It was good.  Great service.  Fun atmosphere. Kid friendly.  Loved their black beans.  My husband loved his fish taco salad.  I liked my meal.  I wasnt excited about my food like my husband was.  My only suggestion to them would be to add more vegetarian options without relying on cheese.
4,"This could possibly be 5 stars. Driving by you would never know this restaurant serves excellent Italian food. It is rather small and has a very different decor from other Scottsdale restaurants. I went on a Friday night and there were not many people there and I have walked by on other weekend nights and it was the same result.  Regardless of that the food was outstanding. I ordered a special, lobster risotto and it was superb. There are many other things on the menu which I would like to try as well. It is rather expensive, but well worth it. The service was also very quick, and it should be when there are not many people dining."
4,This place is similar to Rays on 3rd St. It was lunch time I had an eggplant parm sub very good the eggplant was nicely breaded not gooey and gross. The kid had a slice of cheese the slices are HUGE. The pizza and service here are always good. I suggest this place for dinner more so the meals are way better they come with a house salad and they have more options pasta and such. They deliver too.
2,"Ive had dinner there a couple of times.   The bar is great and the drinks are OK.  The outdoor patio looks comfy and inviting.  It has a large outdoor fireplace.  The inside atmosphere is busy but fun.  The food is always good.  Fish and steak tacos are fantastic.  The macaroni and cheese is one of the best i have ever had and my brother who was visiting from Kansas almost O.D.d on  the stuff.  My only issue would the lack of an obvious manager on the floor or presence of any hierarchy.  Also the lack of hats in the kitchen bothered me a little so dont look if that bothers you also.   Stopped going back, very erratic dining experience.  Over- priced and extremely uneven service.  The wait staff seems completely untrained and unaware."
2,"We arrived at 7:00, had a party of six, and were able to be seated within 15 minutes. Fabulous, considering the number of hungry people coming into the restaurant that evening, but we have always had good luck getting right into Grimaldis, regardless of the location. The new Scottsdale Quarter location has great ambience and service going for it, but I was sorely disappointed by the quality of the pizza. One of the reasons my partner and I keep going back to the Old Town location is for the consistently tasty crust: crisp and thin, yet chewy and moist as well. Our pizza last night had a thicker crust and too well done, by comparison. Maybe the QC will improve as time goes on--Im sure well be back to see."
5,"PHENOMENAL place for Chinese cuisine. The portions are HUGE! My fiance and I always only order one thing and share it, and still always have leftovers. The menu prices are very reasonable. Including tip, we usually dont spend more than $15 for the both of us for dinner. They are very personable and attentive to your needs. I love that it is a very dainty, and has a very laid back atmosphere. The lemon chicken is our favorite!! :) They are also very kid friendly. We have an 18 month old son who always leaves a nice pile of rice on the floor every time we leave lol, but they love him! Highly recommend!"
5,"Japanese chefs, top notch sashimi, affordable neighborhood sushi place! 5/5 Id lived in Japan before and this place can beat those in Tokyo! If you go to Hiro, you have to order their sashimi. We always order scallops sashimi, yellow tail, salmon, toro sashimi and uni (sea urchin)! Their rolls are amazing too. All sashimi comes in a big-fat-lap portion! Very fresh! The service is great too."
5,"No matter where you go in the World if you are wearing an in and out shirt or hat some big guy usually yells out ""In and Out Man I love that place"" I think that says it all."
4,"great beer, great food, great prices and its haunted!!!"
1,"Very unpleasant experience. Creepy male doctor. Uncaring. And no help. I went to this Urgent Care with a swollen ankle so painful that I was nauseous, dizzy and having vision problems. The doctor interrogated me and advised me to get my head examined. Im not kidding.  Mom was right: good doctors dont advertise. This place actually solicits Yelp reviews."
4,"The boyfriend and I went here on a Sunday morning hung over from Four Lokos.  The food was fucking great and I dont even like breakfast food.  I got this egg and jalapeno burrito thing with this sort of runny but generally pretty tasty salsa and I wanted to shower in the burrito filling.  I would have bathed in eggs and salsa if only to prolong my experience with this semi-breakfast burrito thing.  I would have married it and had kids with it and bought a house in Michigan nearby a really good school district.  I fell in love with the egg jalapeno burrito thing, I would cuddle with it on weekday mornings and plan trips to national parks with it.   It was also nice sitting on the patio considering the weather is so pretty and the staff was attentive and friendly and slightly charming with their loafers and novelty socks (is that part of the required uniform I wonder?) Im deducting one star for the sheer fact that this place was filled with rich, middle aged white yuppies talking about golfing and/or glued to their cell phone.  The boyfriend and I, being young dirty Mesa kids still slightly intoxicated off Four Lokos, felt mildly out of place in this setting and were a little over whelmed by the amount of yuppie whiteness. Nonetheless, the food was worth the trip and the cozy patio on a Sunday morning was a nice change from, you know, Cheerios on the futon while watching exercise equipment infomercials."
1,"Not worth comin here. Im all for food like this but this restaurant sucks. They gave me and my dad the wrong meal, and the food was not that good. The meat was dry and the rice was cold. Not worth it."
3,"Ive only eaten the buffet here and it was good but nothing special.  To be fair, most Indian buffets are pretty similar, its only when you order from the menu that you see if the restaurant is really a stand-out.  So, I will update this review when Ive gone there for dinner"
4,"Tough to rank this place...   it is a retirement community first off.   The club house is awesome.   Pool is salt water and heated.   Courses are nice, little bit of a challenge but basically flat.   The putt putt course is very challenging and really cool.    Im not impressed at all with the club food and suggest staying away from the roast beef.   It seemed fake."
3,"First time there the other night.  Friday night, not very crowded for 7:30pm.  We were shown to a table in what looked like a back room - the table was not set, there was just a tablecloth and that was it.  The room is to the right as you walk in.  There were only 2 other tables in there and the windows were covered (no view) - it was weird so I immediately asked to be seated in the main part of the restaurant.  Decor seemed cheap - just my initial impression.  Food was pretty good.  Pancetta wrapped shrimp app was good; Service was good.  Entrees were pretty good - Chicken Parm, Fettucine Bolognese all tasty, but not sure I would go back.  Caesar salad was a bit disappointing...asked for anchovies on the side - never delivered."
5,"I have only gotten the cafe sua da (iced coffee) here but its the best I have had yet. When you walk in there is always fresh coffee lined up in cups on the counter ready to be mixed with sweetened condensed milk. I dont get to Mesa often but when I do I go here for the wonderful, rich, dark and creamy coffee. This is strong stuff; that first sip is so good. The richness, full flavor, creamy caramel flavors are heavenly.  And as the ice melts, it mellows out the flavor a little and its still great. I cant say I have had all the cafe sua da in the valley, but what I have had; this is my favorite.  Next time I come to Mesa for work I will need to come at lunch time so I can try the pho."
4,I tried Narai when my family was in town; everyone enjoyed their meal. They have a wide variety of Thai food and sushi and a full bar. Our servers were very attentive.  I had the tofu pad thai with medium spice (which is still pretty spicy). It had a nice flavor to it. and enough of a portion to take leftovers home for lunch. My sister really enjoyed her papaya salad and thai soup and my parents liked the cashew chicken - the sauce had a great flavor.  There arent a ton of Thai restaurants in North Scottsdale... Id say this one is a very solid pick.
5,"Exactly what a hole in the wall Pho place should be like! Totally reminds me of LA, SF or any authentic Pho place in any multi-cultural city. Congrats Phoenix for not being completely white bred and redneck- must give thanks to center city. Anyhow, portions are large, ingredients taste fresh and prices are inexpensive. If youre one of the sheltered folk out here that gets freaked out by rude bums or the lack of decor- stay in the shelter of your HOA tract home or go to the mall."
3,"I took my family here using a groupon and it was just ok.  We tried to go on Monday however we arrived at 4:30 and the employee working the counter informed us that league play was going to begin at 5:30 so our hour would be cut short.  I was a little irritated with her ""um, yeah sorrry"" but whatever.  We opted to come back the next day to get our full hour.  When we arrived we were greeted by a very friendly gentlemen who provided us our shows and assigned our lane.  We were one of 3 groups in the alley and they placed us side by side instead of giving us a little space.  My wife asked for a glass of water that never came.  So the bowling was fun.  The service was marginal at best.  The lane assignment was awful.  Since we only paid $15 for 4 people for the hour including shoe rental I will go back again for the same deal.  I would never go there paying full price which is outrageous."
5,"My work got some Christmas allowance and instead of doing a dinner we decided to get a really nice lunch for our branch. We decided on Oreganos cause it was on the way.  I had the stuffed Italian sandwich and it blew my mind. I couldnt believe how bug this sandwich was, it provided me with two wonderful lunches.  It looks like some of my coworkers got the sausage sandwich and the steak sandwich and one person got a pasta dish and couldnt even eat a quarter of it because they gave so much.  After that experience I am going to make more of an effort to get to the restaurant instead of getting it to go."
5,"This is our DEFAULT happy hour. I wont be reviewing their dinner as I have never had an actual meal there. Im not really a beer drinker, but they have such a big selection, I always find something i like. And Ive been told they have a martini specials, but you dont go to a beer place and get martinis... come on. Pretty much their entire appetizer selection (which is what, 20 items?) is on the half price happy hour menu. You know what that means? Four sliders and fries for FOUR dollars. (Also recommended... Hawaiian Poke Stack). In summary, I can wrap up Yard House in two words. Heck. Yes."
5,"Ive been Dr. Castillas office for 7 years.  Her office has relocated and her practice has grown over the years and for good reason.  She is a Dr. that treats you as a person and takes her time to honestly answer your questions.  She makes eye contact with you and I couldnt ask for anything more.  Just remember, it is a large practice and the staff is sometimes questionable.  But, shes worth the wait!   Now that weve relocated, I hate to give up Dr. Castilla.  Shes irreplaceable!"
3,"Chicago style hot dog?!  Sign me up!  I just moved here from Chicago, and Ive been dreaming of Portillos since I left.  Where am I going to find something even close to that in AZ?!  I was hoping this would be it.  The hot dog wasnt that bad.  The fries on the other hand, werent so good.  My husband ordered a beef with hot peppers (giardiniera), and they were far from hot...almost tasted pickled.  And the sandwich?  TINY!!!  It was like a 4"" beef sandwich!  I didnt taste it, but he said that it just tasted like a roast beef sammy...not the Chicago beef that we are used to.  One of these days well find a decent ""Chicago-style"" restaurant out here in AZ."
4,"They had me at Baked.Goat.Cheese.   The appetizers were phenomenal, we got the Bake Goat Cheese that came with their freshly baked brick oven bread and my bf got the Romaine salad with fuji apple & bacon.  But the baked cheese was by far the better of the two. Main courses also didnt disappoint we ordered the white fish and hanger steak.  I only had a bite of the fish so I cant speak that much to it, the bf enjoyed it.. it had too much lemon in the sauce for me, but I hate lemon flavoring so its probably better to take his word for it!   The steak had this amazing sauce that accompanied it that added such a nice flavor to compliment the steak.  Both entrees were pretty good size portions, especially after appetizers. And we also split a side of sweet corn polenta that we couldnt finish The actual restaurant its self is very open, there is an outside covered patio and a smaller patio for the bar thats out in the open.   Valet only, complementary Sat Night wait time: approx 20 mins Clientele: On Sat night we had a big table of your typical Scottsdale Cougars, average couples and groups ranging from mid 20s to 60s and a bachelorette party of 4 girls who were barely 21 (not the typical place for a bachelorette party)"
5,"My house has never been this clean EVER!!! I am thrilled with the level of service and professionalism expressed by the women who cleaned my house today! I bought a Living Social coupon, and I am so glad I found this company. 5 women arrived and fully cleaned my house in 45 minutes. The women were friendly to me and especially my dog, which is the sign of a wonderful company, if you ask me. I am hoping I am able to use this service on a monthly basis. Angela scheduled my appointment immediately when I let her know I had company coming in town, and the cleaners arrived during the scheduled time. I am thrilled with the results!"
4,"Ihappened by during their soft open, and I was very impressed with the food. They have a great selection of meats and they are cooked perfectly. They even give you choices of regular or moist briskit (a little fattier to give it more flavor). They have a good house barbeque sauce.   The facility is pretty simple - very ""bar"" atmsphere and TVs along the walls. The staff is great, and eager to make sure you enjoy the food. Ill be coming back."
1,"Our bartender was rude and impersonal, to start. When my wife ordered a diet coke, you could see her disdain. We saw her once more, when she took our food order, after which she sat in the corner and ate. The remaining staff dropped off our food without a word, and never came back; in fact, I had to flag down the manager to get cashed out. The food was sub par. My wifes Shepard pie was all mashed potatoes, and my chicken strips were incorrect and with the wrong side. Also, my fries were soggy because they had been placed over excess sauce.  Poor food, awful service, overpriced beer. Visit the Kyrene location or dont go at all."
2,"Came here one morning a couple of weeks ago.  Had about 50 minutes alloted before my Mayo clinic appointment, so I thought a short stack of banana-nut pancakes would get me in and out fast.  I thought wrong.  Staff was friendly enough, but it took at least 10 minutes for the server to finally take my order.  I asked for banana-nut pancakes, but instead of the pancake syrup (not pure maple), I wanted a side of the blueberry compote that usually comes w/ the blueberry pancakes.  Would this be OK?  Server said yes.  The short stack (2 cakes) arrived 15 minutes later, but instead of banana-nut pancakes, these were blueberries, delivered by another server.  My server came by to ask if I needed anything else, heard my complaint, and rushed back to the kitchen to correct it.  I was assured that it would only take 10 minutes to get a fresh batch out, but another 15 minutes went by before the correct order arrived.  Keep in mind, its already been at least 40 minutes since I sat down.  I only had 10 minutes to spare- not enough to savor these delicious cakes.  The blueberry compote ended up containing corn syrup, the ingredient I was trying to avoid by not using the pancake syrup, but its hard for me to resist blueberry compote, so if I must suffer... I most likely will visit Chompies again the next time Im out and about and craving for pancakes, but only if I have 90 minutes or more to spare..."
5,Great home made taste on the meatballs.  Also they have diet coke.  Shop was nice and clean.  Friendly and fast service
5,If I were to ever get hooked on crack... I would want my crack to be these amazing donuts! They are delicious and addicting.
4,"Nice resort located next to the Desert Ridge shopping complex.  If youre from out of town, this would be a great place to stay since youll be across the street from a ton of restaurants and bars. I went to an event here, and haved stayed here a few times.  JW Marriott has hosted a few wine tastings that Ive gone to, and the resort is super nice, with a staff that is ready and waiting to help you no matter what it is you need. The rooms were decently sized and the bed was big and comfy.  The bathroom was nice as well.   The resort has a lot of fountains around and huge windows so you can check out the great views. The pool area is where its at though.  They have a great lazy river to nurse your hangover on, and a water slide for when youre feeling better.  Of course you can get drink and food service out there and you can even rent a cabana- which I recommend.   Its not that pricey- around $100, so if you get a few people to go in with you, its no biggie smalls. The servers are way more attentive to you when you have a cabana and you can choose different packages that come with water and fruit or lunch and so on."
4,"Is this great sushi?  No.  Does this food reinvent the sushi wheel?  Not even close.  Will I have a foodgasm?  Not a chance. When I am craving an amazing sushi meal, Ill go to Yasu. Why I really, REALLY like Teharu: The food is fresh.  While its not amazing fish, theres nothing wrong with it - nothing here to get sick from. All the standards are readily available and if you want something not already on the belt, theyll gladly make it for you. The conveyor really feeds into my lack of patience.  I sat down, ordered an iced green tea, and started pulling plates off the belt.  Yes, I was eating sushi within 90 seconds of sitting down! The price is a HUGE plus!  I met a friend for lunch - we each had iced tea, several plates with 3 or 4 roll slices, seaweed salad, sunumono salad and a couple nigiri and I was out of there for less than $20, including tip. The place is kept incredibly clean, staff is friendly and Teharu fills a nice niche for a super casual, quick sushi place.  When it comes down to it, I cant always afford to spend what that quantity of food would cost me at Yasu or any of the other great places in town - I like that I am not committing to a whole roll - I can sample from 5 or 6 different ones. Fills the need for the sushi craving on a buget and/or when strapped for time."
5,"LOVE THIS PLACE!  We eat here every Saturday as long as we are in town.  My husband eats here during the week too!  Weekday lunches are a great deal and quick!  The veggie soup is delicious.  The golden wings - Delicious... chicken satay is good too.  For an entree... we always get Pad Prik King chicken or sometimes shrimp but its always always delicious!  Have been trying to find a thai place with this dish closer to home (east valley) but havent found one yet!  Service is terrific!  FYI for those of you who just order Pad Thai... it is very sweet here so if you dont like it sweet... order something else.  Other things weve tried that were good... pepper steak - very good - just dont eat a lot of red meat, massamum curry with chicken good... also we order everything medium to thai hot... like very spicy!"
5,LOVE Five Guys!
1,Not worth the money. Food was average and the portion was small for the price I paid.
5,"This feels like a neighborhood bistro (much like the ones I have visited in New York).  The food is wonderful and the wine selection varies which I like.  My favorite dishes include:  Salmon, crab crepe, burger and ahi tartar -- but their menu changes often, so dont be surprised if you eat something you like and its not there next time."
4,Great fast service! Friendly girls that carried on fun conversations. Beautiful salon with nice pedicure chairs. Great prices too!
5,"Barrio Cafe is an amazing Mexican restaurant.  Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza travels to Mexico for many of her ingredients and you can tell - things are always fresh (they only have an ice cream freezer!), creative and authentic.  I am more than content w/ a mango margarita, the incredible guacamole and the gooey caramel filled churros!!  Even when the restaurant is packed, the staff is friendly and informative."
4,"What a great find! We purchased a deal chicken for this restaurant as we had never tried before. We had an absolutely fabulous dinner start to finish. We started with Caprese salad and stuffed mushrooms both were very good, then for entrees, we had Chicken florentina and Pasta romantico. Both sauces were the best we have had! The atmosphere is like you are in Italy. I would have never figured from the location but we will be regulars."
2,"The valet guys were absolutely awesome.  They were the best part of my stay at this hotel.   The grounds were okay - NOT 5 star quality.  The decor in the rooms seemed old, and the color scheme was dated.  Although most of the staff was friendly, we did have a pretty bad encounter with the pool manager.  My husband and I had bought a bag of popcorn at the grocery store and were snacking on it poolside.  The pool manager came up to us and informed us that outside food is not allowed in the pool area.  She told us that we needed to put our food away.  She then left without even offering the opportunity to order some Fairmont approved food.  It was really strange and off-putting.  We had been sitting by the pool for over an hour and not a single person from the wait staff had come up to us to take our drink/food orders.  Also, it seems a bit ridiculous that we cant eat our own bagged popcorn.  Its not like we were chowing down on a big meal and making a mess.  It made the resort seem elitist.  I definitely wont be staying here again. Ive stayed at the Hyatt Regency Scottsdale before and would definitely recommend that hotel over the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess."
4,"I went here for dinner last night with a group and we had excellent service. The specialty drinks were yummy and were a deal! My favorite (out of two I had tried) was the ketel-one pineapple martini! My sister had a house salad, the dressing tasted homemade, and the croutons were nice and crunchy! I had the Positano Steak Sandwich which was great, my only complaint it was a little too salty, and the fries (and I love fries) were tasty! Other people had the lasagna and they loved it. My sister had the baby back ribs and loved them. If youre looking for a pub-like restaurant that has good prices, pretty tasty food (with a good variety of items on the menu), and excellent cocktails, Keegans is your place!"
4,Great setting to enjoy good food!
4,"Had the thick crust Sicilian pepperoni 3/14/2009, took it to the drive in movies, and while it was expensive (23 bucks), it was worth it! This baby could feed 6 people, and it was pretty good as well. I wouldnt get this on a regular basis because of the price and the calories, but I think its the best pizza they have."
2,"So when you walk in, walk to the right and have the machine scan your card. Im telling you this because I looked like a douchebag because I assumed that the Bally worker would scan my card.  Oh yeah, youll smell urine.  Like, did someone just go crazy and piss all over the place? Seriously, how does a smell get so horrendous like that? What is that?  There are a lot of treadmills and theyre recent...not new...they look overused...but yeah. Im sensitive to smell... I couldnt even exercise."
1,"The 3 employees were so busy talking to each other they couldnt remember what we ordered, kept having to ask, and still didnt get it right.  In the midst of the three employees continuing in their personal chaos, my husband finally said, ""ok, time out! Im the customer.  Make our sandwiches and then take care of your issues."". They stopped for a split second, all three looked at us, then they actually IGNORED us, finished their conversation, then finished our sandwiches.  We were the only ones in there and we really were shocked!  Good thing I like avacado, because it ended up on my sandwich & I didnt order it, and after telling the girl, she said, ""I thought you said..."". Still had the order wrong!  Whew!"
3,"The Service is great.  The food is ok.  The salsa.....horrible.  Please rethink your salsa.  Oh, and if you order a side of jalapenos they charge $1.99.  I have never heard of a Mexican restaurant charging for jalapenos.  Overall, just an ok place.  There are better options on and around Mill."
5,"Id love to give this place MORE than 5 stars!!! In Phoenix a few weeks ago I needed to planb a nice dinner for a group of 10.  I thought about a few places and wanted to come here because of the view.  (Get it? Different Point of View.....?) Anyway, while I did initially pick DPOV because of the view, I fell in love with the perfect service AND the perfect menu. There were great options for my picky group, and not one person left unhappy, or hungry.  In addition, they seem to have a pre-fix menu with a nice price tag if youre ballin on a budget.   Everything was AMAZING and its definitely one of my favorite restaurants in DC!"
4,"This place is so damn tasty.  I love a good burger and I recommend this place highly.  I dont know why I didnt give it 5 stars.. 4.5?  Ok, there we go. I ordered a mushroom Swiss burger and the thing literally melted in my mouth. You have to be careful cause you could literally inhale these things in a matter of seconds.  They are that good! A big plus that his place has is that they sell fried pickles.  I dont know of another small place like this that does.  Veddddy goood.   Thankfully this place is two blocks from my house, so easy access.. lol."
3,"Pretty ok place, right in the thick of it, I saw 3 separate arrests while drinking beer on the patio.  They have a couple different 4 Peaks Brews.  Those facts alone made it a successful endeavor.  Did I mention it was 4pm on a Friday?"
2,"Meh.  Service was friendly, and the atmosphere is bright and festive, but its pretty Americanized Mexican food.  I had a California burro ($9.49), which was a large size, and tasted OK, but for about 1/3 of the price and for about the same size, I can get a better tasting burro with the same type of ingredients at Los Favoritos.  Ive also had dishes with their Baja sauce, which tends to be too heavy tasting for me."
4,"Great, challenging course.  Well maintained. Friendly staff, marshalls, etc. ""Club House"" is still a pretty-fied construction trailer, but they now have supplies, clubs, balls etc. available. The view alone is worth the round.  Unfortunately, porta-potties are only at the practise tees, holes 5 and 13, so it isnt so lady-friendly. The bar cart does make its way around, however and you are given bottled water in your cart."
5,"There are no words to express the value of the quality of service that you receive from  Tina Yraguis Hands 4 Healing  therapeutic overall body care.  The value  of knowledge of the body, the commitment of service, the excellence of research for each individual client. The degree that she possesses cannot be measured with a dollar amount because no dollar amount can beat this value. It is value what goes far beyond what you receive each and every time you see Tina.   Tina is a healer and is dedicated to you.  It just doesnt get any better! Carol Taylor-Tassone Erica Elizabeth Tassone"
4,"My girlfriend and I love Crust and frequent here often. They have amazing pizza, the Rustica is enough for two, and we usually split a salad. They have whole wheat crust, upon request, which is actually really good. There service is awesome and we always enjoy ourselves when we visit. They have a great wine selection by the glass and by the bottle. Our favorite is the red blend that is very unique, let it breathe though. They also have many flat screen tvs so you can keep up with what ever sporting event is on. The atmosphere is casual, but it can get noisy if the restaurant is full. The only time weve ever had poor food is when we do pick up. Its always been hit or miss then. Weve never had a bad experience actually visiting the restaurant, which explains the 4 out of 5 stars."
4,"Weve got another first timer here...! I am just as shocked as the next person that after many years in Seattle, I had never had Bubble Tea.  Gasp!  You can get it almost as readily as Starbucks.  I learned its also called Boba and maybe one other name.  Its all the same to me.  Same-same. I had my first boba initiation at the recent Office Hours with Gabi.  I was completely overwhelmed by the options presented to me: what type of chewies (for the record, that term just doesnt seem right), base drink, optional flavorings, etc.  It was a lot for this gal to handle.  Luckily, Alica B. was at my side leading me down the boba path.   She helped me pick out a concoction of Thai iced tea and regular boba.  Gotta start with the original boba, right?  She ended up with a coffee drink with coffee jellies.  I feel like Im now ""in the know"" because she asked for the coffee jellies and even though they werent on the menu, they indeed had them.  Thats a little insiders tip from me to you.  Wink wink.  She was so excited I thought she was going to consider this woman the Patron Saint of Boba and commence worship on the spot. I was surprised to find how incredibly filling boba is.  I wasnt hungry for hours!  Overall, it was good.  I dont see myself craving boba, but if someone wants to go, then Im in.  Ill check out the jellies in my next go round.  If the craving is boba, I would definitely recommend this place!"
