5,"Perhaps you've heard of the Library of Congress.  Nice Library. Burton Barr Central Library has a bigger reading room. Wil Bruder was the Architect.  You either love his work, or you hate his work.  I love his work!  And, this library is as good as it gets. Arrive in the sixth floor reading room a little before Noon *on* the Summer Solstice.  Ask a librarian:  They'll tell you why. [ah, the mystery....]"
3,"Ok, I usually write longer more intricate reviews about a restaurant but for this new establishment I will summerize. 1.  Great decor and ambience; would be better minus the flat screens 2.  Friendly service; but needs more training with food and knowledge of  3.  Timing of Kitchen; if a table has two or more persons, food should come out at the same time or around the same time.  Especially when they are not sharing. 4.  Food; if you specialize in spring rolls, please make sure they are rolled up proficiently.  It needs to be tight, not loose:) Flavors are good, but there could be a variation of sauce for the spring rolls.  4 rotating flavors for over 20 rolls is not a good ratio. 5.  Pricing is not bad for some items, but I do agree with other reviews that for most items, the pricing is a little high for the neighborhood biz and the quality of food offered. Overall, nice place to hang with friends for a drink and nibble before the actual dinner somewhere else. I will give it a few more months for an update.  This place has potential, but not well executed. When opening a restaurant, you should be ready and able to.  If you are not, you should wait til the staff is well trained.   I believe the owner or chef is inexperience.  Hopefully, it will improve... Get to work guys!!"
4,"I've been coming here for 10 years and still love it. The bbq beans are really good. My favorite thing to get here is a jumbo baker (and they mean jumbo) with everything on it including a side of chopped beef and then I add their homemade bbq sauce to it. Sooooo good. Their homemade root beer and limeade are also yummy. I remember them having a customer appreciation day once a year (I think in May) where lunch and dinner and free! You would get a pulled pork sandwich, a side and a drink for nothing. The lines would be out the door, but the food is worth the wait. I also remember them offering a free dinner (can't remember the choices) on your birthday. It's a cute little place in downtown Gilbert. Check it out."
1,"I hadn't been to Fuddruckers for about 20 years... now I know why.  Cashier was nice and very helpful.  I ordered bacon cheese burger combo.  Fries were only warm, not hot.  Burger was not very tasty and it was full of gristle bits... you know the ones that stick between your teeth.  Lots of trash on the floor.  After we were finished, someone came to ask how things were.  I told here about the fries and she offered to get me more; I declined.  She offered a free dessert: I accepted.  In all, not a good experience, will probably be at least another 20 years before I go back."
4,"Talk about options!  It's almost unfair to have so many items on a menu.   Especially when the food is so good.  I have gone to the Cheesecake Factory several times and have not been able to even put a dent in the menu. So, I wasn't too hungry this time, so I decided to order from the small plates menu.  We started with the corn fritters.  Then I ordered the shrimp and grits and my husband ordered the hibachi steak.   The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because we didn't get our appetizer until the our food was ready.  And by that time, we had already stuffed our faces with bread and butter (which is delicious)!  The server apologized for delay in bringing our app and the manager came by and didn't charge us for the corn fritters.  That was much appreciated!  We only had one of the fritters since our other dishes were in front of us and we didn't want those to get cold.   I really like the shrimp and grits.  I think the dish came with a little too much sauce...but that's just me....I just really liked the taste of the cheddar grits.  My husbands steak was really really good!  The hibachi steak is what I normally ordered.  I will go back again!"
4,"Located next to T-Mobile on the Southeast corner, the parking is terrible because of the ""always busy"" Paradise Bakery.  Good prices (about $1-2 less than most other places), quick service, good manicure and decent arm/hand massage, clean place. I plan to come back try out their pedicure soon."
5,This was our first time at Texas BBQ House. They gave us a sample and help us with our order. The brisket was fantastic. I got the moist and my wife got the lean. We both enjoyed our choices immensely. I will definitely go back. I wanted some spicy BBQ sauce and apparently they have it but I didn't see it.
4,"I stopped by early this morning to satisfy my crave for something new. The place is very clean and a man came out to greet me and was ready to serve. He clearly explained every item I was curious about since the labels were in Spanish. I asked if his name was Miguel and he said yes. I told him I read about his bakery on Yelp. Then he said that he loves Yelp and that's how word is going around now for him and he also uses to find reviews on other places. He was very friendly and had lots of patience. I was the only customer at the time and he actually doesn't mind having a conversation unlike open ended talks with others. I ended up buying 10 pastries and it cost $6.80. What a great deal! They also sell other items such as tamales, burritos, and menudo. I inquired about the burritos cuz I like mine with a little kick,but unfortunately they weren't ready yet. He showed me the homemade tortillas and he says he used them on the burritos. He said they don't look big, but he assured that the burritos are filled with red (mild) or green (with a kick) chili, shredded pork, and some potatoes. He said that one burrito is good to fill up a person. So...I must come back and try it.  So far I've had the flaky pastry with the shredded coconut and Bavarian cream...the Bavarian wasn't as creamy than I'm used to. I almost thought it would have been better off to not have it, but it's a nice added flavor when you eat it all together rather than just tasting the Bavarian on its on.  I had that curvy, pretty looking pastry which is topped with crystal sugars and with all the sugar on top, I thought it might be too sweet, but nope. It was just fine with the pineapple filling (excuse me as I wipe my drool).  Then it was off to have the caramel flautas dusted with powdered sugar. The first bite was eh. The second bite was...um. Third bite, WOW! I finally reached the part that had more caramel in it and I LOVE IT!!! Did I mention that I'm not a big fan of caramel? This caramel is sweet and creamy. It's just so good! A definitely must have for next time. That's about as much my tummy let me eat for today. I'm sure the rest will be just as good and I can't wait till tomorrow morning to try to rest of my goodies."
4,"Good place to have a beer, duck fart, or whatever you may fancy.  I am absolutely in love with their fried pickles. They are so far my favorite in the valley. Long sandwich style slices with a crispy light beer-esque batter. They also have some wonderful perogies on the menu. If you order a burger... you must try the red cabbage slaw as a side. I like going here to just have a low key night. Good place to watch sports too- that's just not really my scene."
4,"I went to Saba's feeling a little scared.  Fast food Greek in a strip mall?  This could go one of two ways...surprisingly good or health code violation bad.   I am very glad to say it didn't end being the latter.  In fact, the food here was pretty damn good.  I did expect Saba's to be an order at the counter joint, so I was a little disappointed to see it was actually a tiny restaurant.  I like my Greek fast and cheap, okay?  But I got over it, got a table and began the interminable wait for our server to stop chatting with other diners and take our order. The menu has all the normal Greek items, including falafel- little fried balls of joy I might add- gyros, vegetarian platters, spanakopita and dolmas.  Prices for the sandwiches and gyros are pretty cheap, but when you venture into the platter territory, you're going to pay for it. Platters start around $10 and go up.  I ordered the falafel, of course, and so did my boyfriend.  The pita sandwiches don't come with any sides, so we ordered a basket of fries to go along with our meal. The dcor was pretty cool with big pictures of Greece all over the walls and the classic Greek music piped in.  Unfortunately, not even the Greek music could mask the hideous, loud tool of a diner that was sitting at the table in front of me. He was one of those idiots that has to talk so loud, even the half-deaf cook in the kitchen can hear him.  He was so loud I felt like I should respond to his questions.  Hey moron- saying things like ""I like it loose, like my women,"" is just not funny. Anyways, when we finally got our food, it was really good.  The falafel pita and the fries were tasty, but our server sucked.  He obviously knew the loud tool, and kept chatting with him while we waited for our check.  That was a little annoying, but overall, Saba's is a good choice for a quick Greek meal."
4,Stopped in for a business breakfast. I had the Chilaquiles with scrambled eggs. It was great. It's not really on my side of town but I'd really like to go back and try some other dishes. Hefty portions at great prices. All four of us ate well for under $40 including drinks.
5,"Beautiful hotel, great rooms, best views out of the resorts in the immediate area.  Service is comparable to a Ritz Carlton.  Very understated and clean feeling, yet still over the top luxurious."
4,Love the medium wings and green salad with thousand island dressing!  The bartender CJ is da bomb!
3,"The coffee at this location is awful- please go get lessons from the lady at the Thunderbird and 40th street location. However, the primary morning guy, Shawn, is awesome. He is friendly and chipper, but not so much so that he's annoying as your first human contact of the day. He is generous with the toppings and speedy."
3,Not a bad place.  Pizza was good but stay away from the wraps as the flatbread wasn't meant for that.
5,"I love love LOVE this place. My boss (who is into healthy eating) recommended this place. I went over with some highly skeptical friends and one dinner was enough to convert them into believers! The food here is so good! We had the Shrimp dumplings and the Onion tart as starters. We ordered the Shirataki noodles and street tacos as entrees. So also ordered the Kale-aid. All of the dishes were yummy.  I have gone back many times since then and have never been disappointed! I have gone after yoga to get some Kale salad or the chicken chopped salad. I always have to get the Kale aid.  Once, a guy at the next table, uprooted a whole plant by mistake (on the patio) and was highly embarrassed as was his date! Ever since, I have very careful not to throw my arms around as I can be quite clumsy sometimes! I do NOT want to be banned from my favorite place for my clumsiness! I don't think I can live without True Food!"
5,"Oh AJ's...  How do I love thee...  Let me count the ways (BEERS)... 1...2...3...200! They have so many different beers to choose from here.  If you ever need an ingredient that is out of the norm they will have it.  If you ever need an ingredient for a special dinner that MUST be fresh and ripe, this is the place. From 10 differnt types of flower, 15 different brands of pasta, to 20 different types of EVOO, if you're making a really great dinner, spend the extra couple of bucks and get your stuff here. One day I'll be able to afford the prime steaks."
4,"Great new addition to Mill Ave.  First stopped by here for a Monday Happy Hour, and instantly loved it. This is a perfect day-drinking place when the weather is nice, and they do a good job of creating a large indoor / outdoor space with plenty of patio. Happy Hour is pretty great - 1/2 off almost all beers. (they do well drink / wine specials too, but don't remember what they were. I think it was $1 off... but don't quote me on that.) Bottom line, I had 3 Firestone DBAs, and i think my bill was about 8 bucks before tip. Score. (normal beer prices are in the $5-6 range. A vodka gimlet not on happy hour (well vodka) cost me $4, which is right where it should be.) Also made a return trip on a Saturday night, to get a feel for the weekend crowd. Not too bad, but mildly disappointed. I was hoping it would remain a little more of the chill day-time vibe, but come 10pm the music gets cranked up, and my group decided to move on to a place where we could actually have conversation without screaming.  (sidenote: every bartender / waitress I've dealt with here has been really, super nice.) Def. worth a shot I'd say, and I could see it being a fave HH place."
5,Tuck Shop is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Phx. Everything is superb from the service to drinks to food to overall experience. Definitely go soon!
3,"Yelper Jane B's review is remarkably similar to what I intended to include in my review. We've stayed at close to a dozen different Homewood Suites over the years and this one left us wishing we could have stayed at any of the others instead. Furnishings were adequate but not terribly comfortable.  The living room had a sleeper sofa and a side chair, a dining table with two chairs, an end table, a coffee table, and a TV stand with 3 drawers plus the kitchenette, all in a room roughly 9' x 14'. The bedroom contained a desk with 3 drawers (serving also as the dresser) and the bed and nightstands.  The desk also served as the TV stand, allowing a small work area and taking up so much room the door couldn't swing all the way open. Our bedroom also contained the mystery deadbolted closet with unknown contents, which took up half the guest closet space. The bathroom was large but dingy and dimly lit. I considered renting an on-demand movie one evening, but everything offered by the hotel was $15+/each (!!) and since there wasn't a DVD player we didn't have the opportunity to rent somewhere more reasonable and bring it back to our room.  Free wifi seemed stable although a bit slow, and the pool was small but the kids didn't seem to mind. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was well-prepared and always had enough variety to keep the kids and adults happy. We got a great rate but hey, it's Scottsdale in the summer so most rates are pretty darn good.  Normally we enjoy staying away from home, but after 6 nights here even the kids were anxious to get home. We'll stay at Homewood Suites again in the future, but not this one."
4,Where else can you get a Chile Relleno wrapped in a tortilla to make a burrito? Super crunchy friend goodness with oozy melty cheese in every bite.. Oh the overkill and love every second of it!! Jen Red Pork in a quesadilla with a side of black beans and jerk fried rice.. this is some serious hybrid comfort food.. may sound strange but works very well! You'll leave super stuffed and change in your wallet from a $10!
4,"I'm not a sushi expert by any stretch, but suffice to say that the rolls here are well-priced, fresh-tasting, and overall pretty damn delicious, with good presentation.  I'm not a fan of their tea, but that's just a personal preference, I think. I enjoy the Las Vegas, but the Spank Me roll was really good as well. We usually mix and match our way around, and right now they're running a ""happy day"" 4pm-9pm special on a lot of their rolls which makes them cheaper by $1-$3, each. Definitely worth it. Good service, laid back vibe, even if the decor is a little ""college dorm"" with the lighting, but overall, fun, good food, and affordable."
4,"Excellent Excellent Excellent...  My wife and I try to eat here at least 3 -4 times a month.  Owners are very nice to chat with.  We planned a trip to Thailand this fall, and the owners help tell us where to go and what to see."
2,The only thing I like about Fez are the pomegranate margaritas.  Food could be better...
3,"The Service is great.  The food is ok.  The salsa.....horrible.  Please rethink your salsa.  Oh, and if you order a side of jalapenos they charge $1.99.  I have never heard of a Mexican restaurant charging for jalapenos.  Overall, just an ok place.  There are better options on and around Mill."
5,"Heard about this interesting steak house from Lindsay, my Yelping 'go to' and I am grateful. What a fun night, feeling ""Mad Men' ish as we walked through the kitchen when entering the restuarant.  Atmosphere was amazing and the food.... WOW. My fav had to be the amazing steak and bean chili/soup.... fantastic. Steaks were our of this world and the mushrooms... devine. When entering the restaurant we greeted by helpful eager staff ... with each one adding input into our experience.... especially Patti, our server. She was helpful, informative, fun and sealed the deal of a fantastic night. Thanks"
5,"The PERFECT Breakfast :)  If only I could have this every day :) Matt's is all you want a breakfast spot to be...cute, friendly and the most amazing food out there. I highly recommend the hog and chick.  You just can't go wrong with eggs*, bacon*, home fries* (get the home fries, not the hashbrowns) and their toast* served with Terra Verde Farms preserves.  * = best ever, ever, ever I could write on and on...you've seen the reviews.  Just make sure to make it there, you won't be sorry, you'll be addicted!"
5,"I booked our anniversary trip to the Westin Kierland through Priceline.  It was so reasonably priced that I was a bit concerned it would lack quality, and after reading a few reviews on Trip Advisor I was worried.  I was COMPLETELY wrong.  This is a 5 star resort from the moment you park your car.  The front desk staff upgraded our room, and this very nice gentleman greeted us with a smile every single time we passed through the lobby.  They have golf carts available to drive you to your rental car.  The food in Deseo is amazing.  I would definitely recommend trying the ceviche sampler and the muddled cocktails.  I can't forget to mention the amazing bread made with tapioca flour, they will even give you the recipe.  We especially enjoyed talking to the girls in the information center (the one that looks like a mine).  They were VERY helpful in giving us advice on local restaurants and insisting we take a day trip to Sedona......we did and Sedona is now one of our favorite cities. Thanks to Ashley, Miranda, Tiffany, Chelsea, and Pat.  When we returned from our Sedona day trip, we had chips & salsa, and two cold coronas.  This was a very thoughtful touch. If you are looking for a fine dining experience, Mastros Ocean Club is right across the street and has incredible food.  I highly recommend the lobster mashed potatoes and the seared scallops.   Back to the resort.......our room had a great view of the golf course which was massive.  Although we are not golfers, we certainly enjoyed the view.  Our room was a pretty good size and the Heavenly Beds are my absolute favorite.  When traveling I will do my very best to ensure we stay at a Westin Resort."
4,"A definite favorite in the neighborhood. The happy hour menu is always interesting and good. In several visits I've never had anything that wasn't delicious, and the beers on special are uniformly impressive."
5,What a place for brunch. $4 drinks are fantastic. Their tenderloin egg Benedict and sea food sandwich is heavenly. Wish we had such a place in Los Angeles.
4,"There are other places in town that are less expensive with better sushi choices, and not as loud, but I had an experience today that inspired me to write here this evening.  I go to Ra (Scottsdale Rd) somewhat frequently for their lunch special which is a good deal: miso soup, yummy salad with addictive ginger dressing, a california roll and four pieces of nigiri. Good stuff. I usually upgrade to a rainbow roll and just pay the difference.  A few months ago I went to a different sushi place in Tempe. I paid with cash and when my change was returned, the server had ""rounded up"" and treated himself to a presumptuous tip (he didn't return my coins). I called the manager over, went home and wrote a bad review on Yelp, tell people not to go to that restaurant and won't return to eat there again. This afternoon I sat at the sushi bar, had excellent service, good happy hour eats, and good discussion with the young sushi chef. I paid with cash and my Ra server gave me back my change ... minus coins. I immediately got tense and thought ""great, here we go again."" I called her over to explain. She said that she had rounded-up - in my favor. I counted my bills and saw that she had indeed given me back my change plus a little extra. She said that she didn't have coins, so she just gave me the difference.  I thought that was very cool. I thanked her, and left a big tip. Now I'm writing about my good experience at Ra Sushi on Scottsdale Road and will definitely keep going there.  It's amazing how one little gesture will have such ripples."
5,This place is so great! I am a nanny and had to bring in a dance outfit to get the straps shorten for the girl I care for. The woman did this for no charge! It was only the second time I went there. She said it would only take her two minutes so no charge. She was super sweet!
2,"Boring.  Uninspired.  Generally sauce-less, which means the meat courses are plain and dry.  The salmon tastes like styrofoam.  The filet is flavorful but they use low quality cuts.  The veggies are simply steamed.  No doubt the options are healthy, but at the sacrifice of flavor.  When I pay this much to eat out, I want to taste it and enjoy it."
3,"I've grown to like Apple, though I've always thought their products were priced on the rich side.  When we lived in Seattle there was a Microsoft bias, but a large group of us all had Apple iPhones.  And that is a key part to the Apple story.  You buy the iPhone and then the next thing you know, you're looking at iPads.   The Genius Bar is fun and very helpful when things go wrong; like when my new phone duplicating one calendar entry 341 times.  I had to bring in my Win-Tel PC into the Genius Bar and in the end we had to delete MobileMe to fix it.   But, absolutely great, GREAT customer service!!! I love my new iPhone 4, and I've had Blackberries for 14 years!  Maybe when they add FaceTime to the iPads, I'll belly up to the Genius Bar."
4,"I've been here so many times, I can't believe I haven't reviewed Black Bear yet! This is me and my friend's ""go-to"" breakfast place. Ginormous portions, and for a decent price. A little slow on the service, but if you're not in a hurry it's no big deal. Basically down home cooking. You see diner and that is exactly what you get. Good eats!"
5,"I used Harvil's Auto Body after a fender bender. They were one of the auto body places that was included in State Farm's program. They were efficient, friendly, proactive, highly-responsive, and helpful. I especially appreciated that they kept me updated on the progress of my automobile and advocated for me/my vehicle when needed. This level of high-quality customer services is hard to come by. If you have a choice, choose Harvil's. You won't be disappointed."
1,"We decided to hit up the ""Wine Down Wednesday"" that was happenin' at Tastings courtesy of KYOT.  Here's what went wrong: The event is from 6-8 so we arrived just a few minutes (3 maybe?) after 6 so we could get a spot just in case it was hoppin'.  We walked in and the hostess (she looks like she's possibly the manager or owner) asked if we were there for the event and then pointed us towards the back room where the event was being held. We walked in and there were about 7 tables and there were people at them all already.  Talk about early bird gets the worm!  We had to wait for about 3-4 minutes for the waitress to finish with a table to find out if we could sit on the patio for the event.  She said yes and that she would be right out to help us.  In the meantime another woman and her friend also took up at a patio table nearby. 20 minutes later the hostess/owner/manager looking woman came out and asked if we had been helped yet.  We said no and she left only to return with a small happy hour flier menu which she just handed from a distance and didn't even come over to our table.  I know you're wondering why I would wait the 15 minutes, but I really wanted to see just how bad the service was going to be and frankly, I just wanted some good $2 wine. It's been about 5 minutes and the same woman comes back with full, detailed menus and I asked if the happy hour flier was the deals for the event and she said yes and then asked if we were ready to order.  Um, you just gave us the menus 10 seconds ago... By now I'm ready to just order and enjoy the meal deals from the event.  I look over the happy hour flier and I see some app deals.  They said there was a specialty appetizer menu.  Not so much, but whatever.  I can deal with that.  Then I see the drink section.  The claim for the event was $2 glasses of wine.  I was excited to try some nice new wines on the cheap, but again... not so much.  In reality it was $4 glasses of house wine which only consisted of three different wines that weren't really what I was looking for.  By now, the other women that were outside decided to leave having had enough of this shenanigans.  We decided (after 30 minutes since we arrived) to go next door to Sprouts, get some apps, and have our own ""Wine Down Wednesday"" at home. I bet there are plenty of people that will have good experiences here and continue to visit happily, but this one experience has caused me to write them off for good (which I don't usually do after one instance).  I wish that I could actually review their wine and food, but the service was so poor and substandard that it's not worth giving them my money.  I understand if the food isn't good at a restaurant - some are just better or more talented than others.  However, any business can and should have good customer service.  I think this is where the cliched line of ""if I could give them less than 1 star I would"" comes in... Oh yeah, and I slapped down a ""You've been Yelped"" card as I left. Take that Tastings!!"
5,"I have found my new favorite sushi spot. I wish it was closer to Tempe, but it's worth the drive. You can tell by their menu that Hana strives to be an authentic Japanese restaurant, as opposed to the sake bomber joint that only has food so they can call themselves a restaurant. You know the kind; the Phoenix area is plagued with them. Hana is BYOB, and there are only a few ridiculous fusion rolls on their sushi menu: most of it is authentic, real sushi.  On my first visit I started with my usual appetizers, and was immediately struck by how unusually fresh and tasty they were. The seaweed salad had just the right amount of sesame oil, giving it incredible flavor. The veggie gyoza were indescribably delicious. They made me realize I'd never had a fresh gyoza before; every one I'd eaten previously in my life was a pale imitation of these little bits of Heaven. The sushi came out fast, even though it was fairly busy this particular Thursday. The first thing I noticed, naturally, was that someone put a burning sugar cube on the tray. ""Hey, fire!"" I thought. It was a nice touch. Then I saw, nestled between the flaming sugar and the wad of wasabe, a small pile of what looked like pickle relish. I guessed what it was, and our waitress confirmed it: it was FRESH wasabe. Real, fresh-grated wasabe is something most people never experience. Most people don't even know the pasty green stuff that's standard in every sushi restaurant is just normal horseradish dyed green. The real stuff is just too expensive, and too difficult to keep on hand. But there it was, no extra charge. It adds a little spice and a wonderful, fruity complexity to the sushi.  The sushi was great. They also have a large menu with all the other Japanese dishes you'd expect, but I didn't try any of them. Next time."
4,"This is a delicious neighborhood restaurant! I can't speak to their sushi much because I have become such a fan of other items on the menu. The handful plus times I have had sashimi here it has always been good. Now on to my favorites! The Asian nachos are a must get. Instead of tortilla chips they use wonton chips. Topped with a yummy cheese sauce, salsa, sour cream, and guacamole. Their guacamole is a mix of avocado and edamame. Yum! Add some chicken and these are super yummy and great for sharing. During my most recent visit here I discovered they have a new edamame. Bun Bo Edamame. It's very spicy. Too spicy for my tongue but the friend I was with loved it. Saved the best for last - the Mojo dessert. I am not a big dessert person, but I almost always order dessert here. It looks like a sushi roll. You get rice krispy treats, rolled up with Nutella, ice cream and a brownie in the middle. Delicious!!!"
5,"Today our travels took us to the Chandler Mall on 10/31/2012. Therefore we were near to Abuelo's for lunch. Nothing like returning to a Restaurant that you found to be very good! We arrived after 1PM, so we were seated ASAP. We ordered drinks first along with a serving of Guacamole. Nice way to start off lunch! My wife ordered the Dilla Lunch while I ordered the Grande Burrito Lunch special. Both item arrived on a very hot plate-wonderful! Whenever we are dining at another Restaurant, a hot plate is always expected but all too often the hot plate fails to appear. Our lunch stay hot until the last bite due to the hot plate service. Everything was great with the meal and no requested drink refills-always a sign of great service! Both restrooms were very clean and serviced many times during the day. We highly recommend Abuelo's for a great lunch or dinner!"
5,"The best fish tacos, period!  And I hate chain restaurants!"
5,"Restaurant 28 is a solid hole-in-the-wall that's pretty easy to miss, but it's definitely worth a stop.  On my visits I've gotten brisket and other barbecue, and my friends swear by the chicken and say it's some of their favorite chicken in the Valley.  The hush puppies are great- the greens are good too. Another review said it well when they said this place doesn't underseason food.  Every time I've gone it hasn't been bland- it's got some great flavor and it's tasty stuff. It's in a pretty dull area where there isn't much else to do, or I'd be out there more often.  It's a tiny place too but I've never been in and had it be hugely busy or busy to the point that waiting was crazy. Definitely recommended, and I hope they're able to grow and thrive."
3,"For quick fast food.. this is my choice.. I usually call ahead and get take out.. Dont expect super friendly.. but its just take out.. not clear table service.. even if you stay.. I always get the chicken salad with sesame vinagrette on the side but I will say, Im not a fan of the pungent dressing.. I get the chile sauce instead.. vietnamese rolls.. and its not so unhealthy.. NOW my friends that usually nosh with me.. hate the foods they get.. they say it every time I suggest this place.. who knows? Since I  havent really tried anything from my norm salad.. I cant say.. but for me its a strong 3.."
5,I'm giving Yoli's 5 stars for the winning combination of great food for a great price at a quaint location. Went there on a Saturday late in the morning and we were seated right away.  Great little hideaway in downtown Chandler.  I ordered the Morning Monte.  It was delicious.  My family ordered various other items and we all sampled a bit off each others' plates and everything was excellent.  My favorite item was the chorizo burro.  Excellent chorizo with the correct combination of meats and spices.  The waitress was friendly and we chatted with the owner and she was very nice also. Another really great thing about this place is the prices.  I don't think there are any items above $8 and most meals here are in the $6-$7 range.  Very reasonable for the good quality food you get. After breakfast we took a walk around the courtyard and had a nice time looking around at the plants and exotic birds they have on site.  We also got a chance to meet the owner of the property and she was super nice also.  I will definitely be back to try out some other menu items.
4,"Over the last 3 years we've lived in the area, this place has changed 4 times.  First Uncle Bear's, then Tio Oso's, then Thirsty Cactus (or Thirsty Cantina, whatever, it sucked), and now it's TC's Pub & Grub.  The menu is typical bar food, including burgers, sandwiches, pizza, wings as well as some taco and quesadilla selections (which I always appreciate a good quesadilla so I will have to try it next time).  The restaurant section (which was always dead before) has now been opened up and TVs added so the whole place is more of a bar feel (thumbs up).  The place was packed for Thursday night football (Cardinal's game!), but still got a good table close to a TV.   Server (who admitted multiple times he was brand new) was very friendly but had to keep asking other servers for clarification on menu, etc.  Still, nice enough and very attentive. We ordered wings (""medium"" but they were spicy!) and their ""ugly"" crust pizza with mushrooms and olives.  The wings, very good, I would get them again.  Pizza, I wouldn't order it again if someone paid me.  The ""ugly"" crust basically is a thick hand tossed crust - too much crust (and half of it was burned) and very skimpy on the toppings.  It was pretty horrible honestly.  The actual toppings (although sparse) were very tasty... good cheese and fresh mushrooms and olives, so I would order pizza here again IF they have a thinner crust option.  Otherwise, if you are coming here to carb load and really need your bread fix, by all means, order the pizza.  I personally prefer a thinner NY style crust. All in all I would come here again based on the good wings and service, and I'm looking forward to trying their other menu options.  p.s. text TCSPUB to 411247 and they'll send you a text coupon for a 50 cent draft. Score! (I'm a sucker for a deal)  Cheers!"
3,"Bad service, great food, awful coffee."
4,"This is one of my favorites stores to head to when I need the motivation that comes from new triathlon clothing and accessories. The staff is knowledgeable and helpful, without being intimidating.   They have a decent selection of women's items that are high quality and come with a high price - so I normally head there when I'm looking for race wear/accessories and go elsewhere for regular workout clothes.   They do have some sale items, and recently I found some great Pearl Izumi tri shorts for half off - woo hoo! It's great to have stores like this geared towards triathlons!"
5,"This is my favorite spot, waterfalls everywhere, beautiful flowers, fun slide, and great food!"
1,"While the menu looked promising, have no idea if the food is any good since the hostess failed to even acknowledge our presence when we walked in the door.   We patiently stood there for several minutes while she walked around us to greet and seat two other parties.   Since we were still unable to get her attention,  we left and went to Tommy Bahama across the street."
5,"I will give this place a 5th star even though i wait for 30+ mins every time i go. that can only mean it's good right? Well, it's that friendly AND that good that i dont mind waiting. i hope it doesnt lose that customer service aspect that makes it so approachable.  best sausage gravy in town with a nice spice to it. i'm not fond of their potato has thingys... but their bfast nachos are fab and their white out omelette is also very tasty. my favorite item - turkey sausage eggs benedict... DD style (trade sausage gravy for hollandaise) - very filling as you can imagine.  breakfast club will still be the old town brunch location for when visitors come visit me but for week in and week out sunday morning brunch, this is my spot."
3,"I've actually never set foot inside this restaurant, so I can't comment on the place itself. But every now and then we've picked up orders from Old Spaghetti Factory at work, so I can comment on the food itself.  The food is as basic as it gets. This is definitely ""family food."" Most adults won't complain about it, and kids will enjoy the simplicity. I recently had the Old Spaghetti Factory's Chicken Parm. I won't call it bland, but it's nothing that the average home chef couldn't cook up for their family.  I will give the place credit for the portions. It's not expensive and you get a lot of food. While the chicken itself was not huge, it comes with Spaghetti, an entire loaf of bread and butter, and a side salad. The salad was way too plain for my taste, but at least I had a little bit of vegetables to go with my meal. It's also quick. Take out orders are almost always said to be ready within 10 to 15 minutes."
4,"oooooooooh man am I SO GLAD this place isn't near my house, I would gain 20 pounds in no time!  My sister took me here for the first time a couple weeks ago and my mind was blown by all the unique flavors they served!  The shop itself is very cute and modern. I like that they have a section in the back with a bunch of board games, very cool.  As for the ice cream I got the dutch chocolate and the horchata. The horchata was so so good, I cant stop thinking about it!  The following week I took the husband there. Again the ice cream was very good but the service was terrible. It was an older lady behind the counter and she really couldn't care less that we were standing there. She let me sample an ice cream and then I just stood there for a good 5 minutes while she did other things behind the counter. We did finally get served but my husband wasn't impressed with the serves one bit. This time I got my ice cream in a waffle cone, the cone was so light and airy, I loved it!"
3,"I recently attended a conference in AZ and stayed at the Squaw Peak. The grounds were very nice, and with all the on-site activities this hotel would be quite a draw for the kids.  Being I don't have any kids, plus it was too cold to be out by the pool, activities on site were pretty limited. The gym facilities and the comfort of the bed made up for the lack of adult festivities. The gym was good sized and had ample new equipment. The bed was really comfortable and had great pillows.  Great for a family vacation, A-Ok for the business traveler."
2,"Five Guys is great for those days when you want to spend $12 on a glorified fast-food hamburger. The meat comes in a wafer-thin patty, and doesn't really taste like anything, just like at Wendy's. The bun tastes mass-produced.  I also don't especially care for their fries, although this is a matter of taste more than anything. I'm not generally one for mushy, thick, ""natural"" fries of the sort served here.  I can't help but wonder if people rate this place purely on the quantity of food that you get. The normal size for the burger is a double-patty, and the fries come overflowing from a 12 oz. drink cup.  I would rank the burger places around mill as: 1) Smashburger, for their delicious Arizona burger, and the awesome smash fries 2) Chuckbox, for delicious char-grilled meat that actually tastes like meat 3) In-n-out, for great-tasting meat and some of my favorite fries 4) Five Guys, 5) Fatburger, seriously why the fuck does anyone eat at Fatburger?"
1,"I give this place NO stars. They have karaoke which would be good except for the co-host is NASTY! The rest of the bar is typical with darts, pool and poker. The food SUCKS! don't bother to go here unless you like being whined at by a wussy faggot at night long. I know that is harsh but the co-host really is nasty."
4,I've been to Joe's & Bobby Q's but Dave's takes the BBQ on this one! We got Dave's family portions for one of our many tailgating experiences. We tried all of there dishes and the beef brisket was delicious as was the pulled pork. And don't forget the cornbread muffins. While this is a place you cannot go often or you will be the pig! Its worth the calories every now and then!!
4,Absolutely delicious food at reasonable prices. Only complaint is that they only sell cans of soda. This kind of meal requires a big old drink
4,"These guys scare me. We set up a repair with Karen for a noise in the dash area which i said seemed to coincide with the gauge movement at start-up. Well, we came back the next day and found we had a new stereo but the noise was louder. The dash was pulled and it was determined to be the A/C door actuators and Karen set an appt. for drop-off and rental car pick-up the following day. On the way down the A/C quit working completely. Angie called me the next morning to let me know we could pick up our one day rental as they replace the condensor. Nothing was said about the noise which we brought it in for originally and, more to the point, no knowledge of this at all was logged into their system regarding why we dropped it off the night before. We had already been set up in a rental car by Karen the day before but for some reason nobody had a clue what was going on and she and the technician had both gone on vacation. Finally after speaking with the service manager, Gary, and explaining to them what should have been in the notes on my car it was determined they would handle everything and we could keep the rental on their dime. This made me feel better and we picked up our car 2 days later with functioning A/C. On the way home from the dealership the A/C quit working again so back it went for another random repair. Tuesday came and we picked it up again after they had to make some A/C computer module fix but... on the way home from Coulter... my wife noticed the ABS and Traction Control lights were flashing red and indicating they were innoperative. So now the car was unsafe to drive but at least we had A/C to keep us cool if we had a wreck from the new issue. We took it back to night drop-off since they were now closed and this morning, Wednesday, they have it back in the shop to see what happened as they were doing the other work. I'm so happy I don't own the warranty company since I'm sure they are paying for all of these mistakes.  Hmmm... Update to follow - Noon 8/29 update - Our new service person, Ben, called and as it turns out this is totally unrelated to the A/C issue but is instead, the brake pedal sensor, whatever that is. It's ready to come home. I'm beginning to think that the consumer reports review on this GMC Acadia is accurate. 40K+ for a good looking, nice handling, unreliable SUV.   Overall I have to say that once Gary and Ben were involved this has taken a turn for the better and maybe all this confusion was just a fluke. I'll give them another chance next time we have a service issue."
4,"Not a bad visit. I regularly visit the Location in Columbus, OH. I have developed a certain expectation as to the type of service that should be implemented in this concept. Compared to Hooters, this place will eventually put Hooters out of business. The food is consistent and delicious. I am a huge fan of the shepherds pie  and Quinlans 5 cheese pizza. The service at this particular Location was a few notches below the service provided at the Scottsdale and Columbus Locations. The servers seemed under trained in how to communicate with the guests. That preferred to fraternize amongst themselves which was the only fault that was noticed. The place was clean, restrooms well maintained, and the food was expeditiously served. Prices are a little high but who are we kidding, commodities are up everywhere. I will always stop by when passing this concept. Compared to it's competition of sports bars it is among the top of the list."
5,"My boyfriend and I stopped by to grab a bite to eat before work and long story short -Greeted immediately  -Lots of variety -Meat lovers pizza is amazing -Ask for Tawnya she's really nice and a wonderful server  -Will be back, loved the excellent service!!"
3,"Alison B. sums up all the great things about this unique store - and I would return if I was looking for a unique gift for any female friends of mine. However, when I went in on a Sunday I was 1 of 4 women in the store.  The man working was chatting it up with the 3 other women who turned out to be together, and once they left he had a seat and didn't say a word to me as I browsed.  I walked out after several minutes of silence."
5,"Where to begin? This is my favorite Mexican food establishment ever. I've been frequenting Carolina's for years and never once have I been disappointed. Some might compare it to Filiberto's or any of those [insert surname here]berto's but this is on a whole different level. Atmosphere-wise it's one step above a sketchy hole-in-the-wall but the food makes up for everything the appearance of the place lacks. I don't know their secret but their beans, the tortillas, the salsa... it's all to die for. And IT'S. SO. CHEAP. Like, seriously, I'd dish out more money for this food but the fact that it really is that cheap is the icing on the cake.  It's almost always busy but it's always worth the wait. Always. If you haven't gone... you're missing out."
4,"Who's got the munchies!!!!! Friday and Saturday nights till 3 am, Mrs. White's is servin' up some yummy munchies including Fried Zucchini around $3 and entrees for $13.  I had to have their fried chicken , pork chop and some gravy and rice at 12am! The fried chicken was cooked perfectly.  The skin is crispy and tasty.  The meat moist and tasty.  The portions are huge and you will not go home hungry.  The staff is friendly and helpful; always a pleasure to talk to them.  Skip Filibertos or Jack n' Box after the party..movie..concert..and go to Mrs. White's!"
2,"For what it is, cheap easy family friendly food with a bit of a yuppie bend, its not bad. But they messed up a grilled cheese sandwich. How do you do that? My mom, god bless her, can't cook to save her life. None the less, she can still make a pretty damn good grilled cheese. Its not rocket science. Let me walk Sauce through this: - Cut slices of cheese. Precut is pretty gross. - Put bread around cheese. - Apply butter to the outside. - Grill til melted. Yet, my girlfriend's grilled cheese was horrible. Bad bread, thin on the cheese, and it tasted like heated cat turds. I'm just not that impressed. I know lots of you love this place, but I don't for the life of me know why. It would have been 1 star, but the mac n' cheese bought it an extra star.  Why is it so hard to find good pizza in Phoenix. You'd think with its mob proximity to Las Vegas that it'd have better Italian food. And yet, not so much. I blame the Mormon influence on this town. Too many years of Kraft products and special underwear have really killed the food talent here."
2,"Thai??? Really?? I love Thai food and couldn't be happier to try a new restaurant. Wow! It was a slap in the face on so many levels. The 2 hostesses were the rudest I have had the displeasure of having to interact with. We ordered take out and as we waited for out food from the kitchen the hostesses made us uncomfortable... As if we were imposing on there entry. The food was not spectacular. We ordered pad Thai , was very dry but not horrible. The sweet or sour beef was watery and seemed more like fajita with way too many peppers. No  sticky rice, green papaya salad, Larb..."
4,"The ""Shoe Dog"" experience was quite fun and entertaining!  It assists in finding the right shoe for your foot...and pretty accurate! Shop from hundreds of the best walking and running brands like ASICS, adidas, Brooks, New Balance, Saucony, Mizuno, Merrell, Nike, Puma, Pearl Izumi, Sperry, Timberland, Under Armour. You'll find fantastic natural running shoes from Vibram Five Fingers, Newton Running, and K-SWISS and trail shoes from Merrell, Salomon, and UK Gear. Grab the best gear from brands like Garmin, Baby Jogger, BOB, GU, Honey Stinger and FRS. You'll also find your favorite Triathlon Gear in the Road Runner Sports online Triathlon store. store. Choose from brands like 2XU, Shimano, Bont, Giro, Aquasphere and Xlab."
4,"If you need a hat, this is where to go."
5,"Great service, great food, highly recommend.  We had the scollops and they were to die for, the scotch beef and mac and cheese were also amazing.  Will definitely go back and recommend to friends."
4,I love this place. The service is absolutely amazing. They are always really friendly and never screw up my order - - things that are very important when it comes to fast food. Their Apple Walnut Chicken salad is amazing! I also crave their fried zucchini on a steady basis. Carl's Jr has some of the best fast food burgers out there... if you want something fast and GOOD then I think you should stop here.
5,"We were here on Wednesday, 12/21/11. We had been at a Rubios in CA recently and was extremely disappointed. Not this time! Jacob was our order taker and was VERY courteous and professional.  My husband got two fish tacos that were a good size and yummie. I went with the grilled veggie burrito and man, it was huge and tasty! This is what Rubios is about!"
3,"Great ice cream, but still just ice cream. Really enjoyed the salted caramel alongside a scoop of sweet corn. Feel a little silly for driving from Phoenix just for the taste but no complaints."
1,Was I there on a bad day or what?  I showed up 15 minutes after they opened and EVERY item I tried was either luke warm or cold.    They have 15+ items on the lunch buffet and I tried a bite of all of them.   Gross and bland.   I felt sick to my stomach after I left because I kept thinking how bad the food was. Yuck!
5,"I'm giving this Office Max five stars for convenience, friendly service, competitively priced products a stocked shelves.  This Office Max is a great in and out shop. On one side there is the detailed supply store and on the office side, there is a complete copy center. It's open until 9 on the weekdays and they don't make you feel rushed if you get there at oh let's say...8:50. In fact, they are helpful! They walked me around and helped me find the random items I needed. The copy center staff was also very friendly.  This Office Max has your complete supply of office items but their prices are very reasonable! I purchased the same item at another shop that I did here and it was significantly less expensive here.  So on that note, I end my review on Office Max but I will report back with any new findings."
4,"I met up with a girlfriend at borders. This Border's is across from the Scottsdale fashion square. The store is inviting, clean, bright, and new. They have a variety of books, and good sales. Upstairs is the Seattle's best coffee cafe. I had a coupon for a free medium drink when you buy a bag of coffee beans. I was surprised how good my cafe mocha was, better than Starbucks. note: If you have little kids, they do have story time on Mondays at 10:00 AM. Every Friday is Bean Friday in Seattle's Best Coffee cafe. Buy a bag of beans and receive a FREE medium beverage."
4,I just love this place and  I always leave feeling refreshed and relaxed.  Highly recommend any of their spa treatments.
3,"A nice place to shop, but I wouldn't want to live there.  I never used to be a department store shopper, but recently Ive discovered that nicer cloths just seem to fit better. Go figure. While I still like getting a deal, I usually wait until there is a clearance or sale or some type. The macy's at scottsdale fashion square seems to have more selection, such as more size options for the items you seem to like and a few more items to choose from also. For guys, I would suggest checking out the Dillards at fashion square; the mens dept is about the size of this entire macy's store. 2 or 3 times a year dillards has an awesome clearance event and you can pickup 65% off clearance prices; which are usually already 50 - 70% off the original price. I digress; this is supposed to be a review of macy's. If you're in the biltmore area and looking for higher end quality shopping go ahead and check them out, then travel down camelback to fashion square mall when they tell you the item you like is only available in your size at a different store."
5,I went here for my birthday this year. The best part was my friends picked up the tab:) The food was fantastic. When I found out from a friend who works here that the same chef who created the city hall menu is the executive chef at ocean club I knew getting a steak to compliment my fish was the right choice. The only down side was that everyone who went out that night were so full that we decided that it was a better idea to go home ad sleep than hit the clubs.....well maybe that wasn't a bad thing after all.
5,"It is almost impossible to find a great sandwich shop that actually has good grinders and sandwiches.  Well my search is over.  I stumbled across this little shop and felt right at home in New England.  Being from Connecticut, I was so excited to see all the great food on the menu.  I had the Vermonter and it was bliss at every bite.  The owners are extremely friendly and you can tell that they want you to be very happy with their food and service.  Great food and great service, you will not be dissapointed...."
5,"I loved Joe's Farm Grill...you haven't lived until you have tried the Blue Cheese Burger..(not sure what it is named on the menu)...I fancy steak encrusted with blue cheese, this burger is the next best thing.  Their garlic fries are to die for...heck, everything they cook is incredible...worth the drive..."
5,"One of my fave places in Phoenix. Well stocked and friendly staff. I don't normally peruse the DVDs or CDs because they tend to be pricey,but one day I just decided to take a look. That's when Border's became one of my fave places. I was able to find a fairly rare documentary DVD. I paid 40 bucks for it,but have never seen it offered for sale anywhere before. I very much appreciate a business who refuses to cowtow to the ridiculousness of political correctness. For that alone was well worth paying 40 bucks for. I was even more impressed by the staffer who rang up my purchase for not only being knowledgable about the DVD but letting me know they had a biography of the director of the film that had just come in. Even though the shipment had not been tagged and put on the floor for sale yet,the staffer called to have someone open the box,and bring a copy for me to look at. I bought that too! I will coninue to patronize Borders and any other book store that chooses not to censor!"
4,"Been to the Spotted Donkey in Carefree multiple times and always been happy.  (can't speak to their new location on Hayden as we haven't been there yet).  The drinks are very good, if a bit pricy and the apps are wonderful.  Ordered the short stack of nachos, stuffed peppers and enchaladas this time.  All very good and tasty.  One note, everything seemed to be a bit ""saucier"" this time, especially the nachos.  While the sauce is very good and tasty with a good amount of spice, it was a bit mcuh for me.  I don't remember it being that way before so perhaps this was a fluke. Will definately be back"
2,"Returned here after a year's absense. I understand they have had a change in management. some for the better, some for the worse. new general manager and now the service seems much friendlyer and efficient. New chef and now food is slow to arrive and not as good as it used to be. steak was charred, mashed potatos were lukewarm. Took over 30 minutes for our food to arrive. hopefully it was just an off night for the kitchen. but the general feel was that they lost the attention to the little details"
3,"In the office, Fiesta Burrito is aptly known as ""across the street.""  Kind of like, ""How about across the street?""  ""Yeah, I could do across the street, today.""  If I ever said, ""How about Fiesta Burrito?""  I would get, ""Where's that?""  Then I would have to say, ""You know, across the street.""  And the response would be, ""Well, why didn't you say so in the first place."" The primary reason we eat at ""across the street"" is because it is convenient - it's across the street.  And in the immortal words of my most quotable co-worker, ""It is fast, cheap, and good -- no questions asked.""  The part about it being good is debatable.  I could do with a little less greasy.  Fast, no question.  And despite that fact that ""across the street"" charges 60 cents for spicy carrots now, the prices are low.  I like the chorizo plate with a side of sour cream, although I might start branching out as we eat at ""across the street"" way too much, and I'm getting tired of always having the same thing. At just above a dive, I would call it a hole in the wall, but really, it is just a generic Mexican joint that hides in plain sight.  Even the name is rather plain as no one can seem to remember it.  There is a smallish, generic inside dining area, which is accompanied by a small, generic patio for outside dining.  Some high school students seem to come by for lunch leave.  The staff is polite.  Until they move or I no longer work across the street, I'll be a regular."
4,"A short review is in order here because after all we are talking about freakin donuts.  However, in AZ there are no good donut shops for the most part.  We had three donuts - glazed, chocolate long john, and a chocolate old fashioned/sour cream.  The last was a bit stale.  The first two were great.  We will go back.  Nice little place and it's open 24 hours."
4,The food is always awesome.  Best in the area.    The people behind the counter need to pull their heads out of their asses.  Don't be rude to me if I ask for an extra bag to carry my food.  I'd be happy to let the food drop to the floor for you to clean up.
4,We've eaten at this location quite a few times. We've always enjoyed it. The pizza is great and the employees are friendly. We also threw my son's 6th birthday party here in sept. Our hostess assigned to our party was great and very patient with all the kids.  My son said it was the best party ever. We'll definately be having more parties here!
4,"My sister and I went today for brow waxes. The establishment is spotless. Cleanliness is really important to me. My esthetician was Alexandra. She was very professional and explained everything she did before she did it. I've had many waxes and know the procedure, but it was a nice touch.  When we arrived for our appointments we were told about their package prices. I'm a pay-as-you-go type person so I declined. It was not a hard sell and I really appreciated that. I made a follow up appointment in 2 weeks."
3,"The experience we had was just fine.  Food, service and wine list were all good - salad bar was good too.  I am not sure if I'd go out of my way to go back though.  There are a lot of trendy and fun places to dine in the Scottsdale area and this one seems to be like the ""Grandfather of Scottsdale Dining"" - older and almost antiquated."
1,"Do not go to this car wash. I dropped my kids off at choir and thought I'd run in for a quick car wash. Oh no! They locked my keys in the car. I couldn't get On-Star to unlock my Suburban because it was under a huge canopy and couldn't get a signal. Instead of calling a locksmith, the car washers tried and tried to get in through the window. Thankfully my husband was able to leave work early, go retrieve the kids from choir practice, and then come rescue me at the car wash with a spare set of keys. I was trapped there over an hour!  The manager then had the audacity to get mad at me because I was upset at their incompetence. They didn't even comp the car wash!  If you go here, don't pay for your car wash until your car is done!"
4,"This Target gets the job done. Their shelves tend to be in a little disarray, and their makeup selections are generally lacking, but other than superfluous purchases I didn't even need to make, this Target has never let me down. The grocery section is probably the cleanest and best in the store. I love perusing these aisles. Their clothing section is pretty diverse, but because the store is somewhat small, it's packed in tight. It's a challenge to maneuver the area. The biggest perk is its central location to southern Tempe. It's also very rarely busy during the day, which is awesome!"
