4,"One of my lunchtime favorites -- a great bar menu under $10 (steak, shrimp, Italian sausage, etc) with good quality food and prompt service.  Fun place to have drinks at happy hour. Plus, they have a nice traditional dining room for dinner.  The bar area is always DARK (how it should be)."
3,"Good sandwich! Better than all the chains, doesn't beat Jason's deli, would like black tea (not green). Fresh tasting and clean"
5,Wow! The Penang Curry (chicken) was absolutely incredible!! The portion was huge...had enough left over for another meal and tasted just as good the 2nd day. I will definitely be back! The Thai Tea was very good also. I just wish it was closer to Gilbert!
5,"This is my favorite venue--we've held two events here, and I've attended another four. As an attendee, it's clean, bright, FREE parking, good food, constantly refreshed coffee and beverages, and good layout.  I love it.  As a planner, it's a good deal for what you get, and it's a well managed event end to end.  Conference staff are easy to work with, flexible, and they are there to support you.  IT works and it works well. it's a great facility, food, service, and staff.  Good open expo area too, if you have vendors, advice--do not use a separate room if you have a lot of vendors--put them in the main ballroom, and/or the vestibule, not in any other room.  Vendors like to be showcased and have traffic, not shuttled off to a low traffic low visibility area --regardless of any price savings."
5,"Perfect burritos, polite staff with a couple cuties working here.  I love Chipotle!"
5,All around great food.  True Texas brisket experience.  Meat has great flavor and tasty sides add variety to the offerings.  Don't forget about the sheet cake for dessert!!  I'll be back.   ***Read another review on here talking about wings.  They don't have wings here!!  Get your reviews right people.
2,"My wife and I were looking for a dinette table. We looked at many places and ended up at the RoomStore. We found a great table and decided to purchase the item.  The salesman was nice and didn't provide too much pressure.  There is a LARGE selection of items-couches, tables, chairs, dressers etc. My problem was that we bought the table and had a deferred pickup due to moving into a new home several weeks down the road. I placed a small down payment to reserve my item. After several weeks, I contacted the RoomStore to pick up my item since I just moved into my new home. My item was not in stock and was told to call back later in the week. I called 4 days later and was informed the item was now available.  Today, I went to pay the balance of my purchase and take home the table. Small problem, the table and chairs are not at this location.  I was given the choice to pick up the item at the distribution center 30 minutes away or wait until until Tuesday. I wish that during my several contacts during this process that someone would have told me that I wouldn't be able to pick up my item here or wait several other days. I was not happy! Now I have to go back once again to pick up the table and chairs."
5,"I was sad to come back to lai lai's and they no longer had the Mongolian :( boo,, but i took my mom there and we were starving so we decided to order off the menu. My mom is allergic to  msg and they helped us with what we should order. and she didn't get sick!! woo hoo.. we ordered three dishes and an appetizer to share between her , my bf, and myself, and we stilll brought food home, and I dont think we spent over $30 bucks for all that food!! it was very good to! i love good cheap food!! Ill be back, they are always friendly."
1,"Do not go to this car wash. I dropped my kids off at choir and thought I'd run in for a quick car wash. Oh no! They locked my keys in the car. I couldn't get On-Star to unlock my Suburban because it was under a huge canopy and couldn't get a signal. Instead of calling a locksmith, the car washers tried and tried to get in through the window. Thankfully my husband was able to leave work early, go retrieve the kids from choir practice, and then come rescue me at the car wash with a spare set of keys. I was trapped there over an hour!  The manager then had the audacity to get mad at me because I was upset at their incompetence. They didn't even comp the car wash!  If you go here, don't pay for your car wash until your car is done!"
1,"Most horrible buffet I have ever been to. My boyfriend and I are big chinese buffet fans. A ton of them have raised their prices recently (and, not surprisingly, have been closing down left and right).. so the prospect of a good buffet at 5-8 dollars was absolutely amazing. We read all the reviews on yelp and I had high hopes. Dear lord. The food is awful here. Inedible. Tastes very distinctly like a bad frozen dinner.  The only thing I remember being remotely food-like was some kind of beef and onion dish.. which tasted a bit like a philly cheesesteak. not exactly asian fare.. I tried really hard to like this place. My boyfriend didn't like any of it either. I don't understand how they have such good ratings. The ONLY thing I like about this place is their dessert bar, because they have toppings for the frozen yogurt. It always annoyed me how so many buffets don't even have sprinkles.. so they've got that going for them.. though I think I'll just go to Mojo or Yogurtland. haha. In short, I don't understand how anyone can eat this garbage."
5,"We were staying at the Claredon and the desk clerk (who is also from Yuma) told us that their restaurant was voted best Mex in Phoenix and she swore it was true so we had to try it. The elote (roasted corn with cheese and smokey paprika) was fab, as was the ceviche! The carne asasda taco was tasty, as so many have already said. The real stars, however, were the pork belly and vegie tacos. I'll be dreaming about those til our next trip north."
3,"I stayed here in March'10 and thought the place was alright, nothing to rave about but here was my experience: PROS: 1.  Location was good for what I was there for (work) 2.  The nightly rates were really cheap (this had to do with my company more than the establishment though) 3.  Easy enough drive to/from the airport 4.  You can almost bypass Phoenix altogether getting to Scottsdale. 5.  Their was plenty of shopping places about a mile and a half up the road (think Best Buy, Target, McDonalds, etc...) 6.  A pretty happening restaurant/bar up the street that gets two thumbs-up 7.  The rooms were actually really spacious and nice...it was like having a luxury one bedroom apartment scaled down for size (full kitchen, massive bathroom, den seating area & king size bed in a comfortably sized room). 8.  Hot tub was rockin' & nobody gave us a hard time about having glass bottles out there. CONS: 1.  Once I checked in, I had to lug a ton of stuff over to a room in the one of the back buildings and I couldn't see my rental car (maybe I'm weird...but I like to have my car close by) 2.  I unpacked and got situated to find that the internet in my room wasn't working (Must have!), called the front office and they had to move me to an entirely different room (mind you I just unpacked...AGH!) 3.  I ate dinner a couple times with co-workers in their lounge, & while it was good...it wasn't great, so we all ate at the restaurant/bar up the street the rest of the time. 4.  Be aware, you stand a decent chance of see spiders looming around...so you have been warned, but otherwise it's real clean. I'd stay here again pending that I got the same room rates that I did last time, but it's my understanding having talked to the girls at the front desk that we got booked at unusually low rates. ***Don't get sucked into any of that ""time-share"" crap...they don't push it like some other places I've been...but it's NEVER a good investment***"
4,"I came here in December and look forward to my next trip so I can get some more of the Tuna Noodle casserole!  It was so basic sounding on the menu, but when away from home its comfort food.  So I got it and it was way better than what I make.  Now I need to have it again so I can figure out how it was done!  I can't describe it, but man it was ridiculous! My husband had the Big Unit.  He shared it with 3 others, but he could've easily eaten the entire dog.  It was long and skinny.  The toppings aren't heavy either.   The Catcher mitt dessert wasn't to die for. Parking is a pain in that area, especially since the meters only took coins."
2,"Thai??? Really?? I love Thai food and couldn't be happier to try a new restaurant. Wow! It was a slap in the face on so many levels. The 2 hostesses were the rudest I have had the displeasure of having to interact with. We ordered take out and as we waited for out food from the kitchen the hostesses made us uncomfortable... As if we were imposing on there entry. The food was not spectacular. We ordered pad Thai , was very dry but not horrible. The sweet or sour beef was watery and seemed more like fajita with way too many peppers. No  sticky rice, green papaya salad, Larb..."
4,"A definite favorite in the neighborhood. The happy hour menu is always interesting and good. In several visits I've never had anything that wasn't delicious, and the beers on special are uniformly impressive."
5,"Originally came by to get a watering system for our chickens and ended up buying something for every member of our furry family! They have everything here for cats, dogs, small birds, rabbits, poultry, horses and more! The customer service was excellent, we were even given free samples for our chickens without even asking and were given informational sheets about some awesome products we ended up buying as well. Both of the people working were concerned with taking their time to help us, not about making a sale, and will even special order some products for us if ever needed. We don't feed our dogs dry food anymore (they now eat raw instead), but when we did, these are the premium/healthiest brands we were buying at a much higher cost at other retailers. The prices are low, the hours are convenient, the customer service was great, the products are healthy, and the selection was large for how small the shop is, what more could you ask for? Great first visit and we will definitely be coming back again!"
4,"Everything about Coronado Cafe is charming and scrumptious.  It's my go-to place when I want to have a nice, but not fussy, lunch with a friend.  The menu has a lot of variety but not so much that it's overwhelming.  I've never been disappointed by the food.  The raspberry iced tea is delicious too! I like that they don't have any fried food, though my male friends don't so much appreciate that as they prefer fries with their burgers.   Conversations can be challenging when dining inside-- the acoustics in an old house aren't the best to begin with, and then you cram it full of people and it gets a little noisy.  If you can't tune it out, the patio is a really lovely alternative.  All in all, you really can't go wrong here!"
3,"Who would have ever thought, chicken and waffles combination?  It is crazy, but it sure does.  The location of hidden inside a big plaza of Albertsons, Aces Hardware, Gas Station, and much more.  It is really hard to find unless you have been inside the shopping center.  People here in AZ like to say something is located on the northwest corner of the street.  This would make it impossible to describe. Once you get there, the restaurant is pretty small.  Typically there is a pretty long wait, but I was lucky the day I went. One good thing is they offer white breast chicken meat, which is always a bonus.  The chicken was tasty, even though I am normally not a fan of fried chicken.   I love waffles, but it seemed like the waffles came out cold, as though they were reheated or Eggo Waffles.  I loved Eggo Waffles growing up, but I don't expect frozen waffles at an establishment.  I would stick to the chicken and call this place Lo Lo Chicken House."
4,"Great find! The boyfriend and I were aiming to check out Geisha A Go Go's happy hour but no seats and loud music drew us to find a more intimate spot. Kyoto hit the spot! The sushi was great at a reasonable price off the regular menu. The staff was friendly and laid back yet still attentive which was refreshing.  I loved all the rolls we tried: (in order of favorites) caterpillar, Philadelphia, Salmon volcano (warning it is salt that they light on fire), tuna maki, and another I can't remember. Although the boyfriend is still partial to Roka Akor, I think this is my new favorite location! I definitely cannot wait to come back and please open a location in Glendale!"
5,I have been going to Salon Mila for 12 years.  I will never go anywhere else.  My hair always looks amazing when I leave.  The color and cut are always perfect!  I feel glamorous and beautiful when I leave.  First class salon!  Beautiful surroundings!  Always great service!  They aim to please!  Mila knows what it takes to make sure her customers feel welcome all the time!  Thanks everyone!
2,"Five Guys is great for those days when you want to spend $12 on a glorified fast-food hamburger. The meat comes in a wafer-thin patty, and doesn't really taste like anything, just like at Wendy's. The bun tastes mass-produced.  I also don't especially care for their fries, although this is a matter of taste more than anything. I'm not generally one for mushy, thick, ""natural"" fries of the sort served here.  I can't help but wonder if people rate this place purely on the quantity of food that you get. The normal size for the burger is a double-patty, and the fries come overflowing from a 12 oz. drink cup.  I would rank the burger places around mill as: 1) Smashburger, for their delicious Arizona burger, and the awesome smash fries 2) Chuckbox, for delicious char-grilled meat that actually tastes like meat 3) In-n-out, for great-tasting meat and some of my favorite fries 4) Five Guys, 5) Fatburger, seriously why the fuck does anyone eat at Fatburger?"
1,This place was messy and loud.  The food really wasn't great and the salsa bar looked like a three year old put it together.  Overall the only plus was the tortilla chips that were free before the food.  I will not be back unless one of my friends pays for me
5,"Both of my girls have been enrolled in Marilyn's studio and it has been a wonderful experience for our family.  The teachers are engaging and creative and as a result both of my girls love to dance and my eldest daughter who is now 11 has been dancing with them since the age of 3.  No stage moms here, but rather a warm, friendly environment where girls can develop their dance abilities free from the high pressure nature of some studios.  Our family looks forward to many more recitals to come.  Thanks Marilyn Bostic Ballet Centre for helping develop our daughters' confidence and love for dance!"
5,"Loved this place!!!! Was searching for a great authentic BBQ place, and this is it!!!!!"
4,"I hate food shopping.  Okay that is probably an understatement.  When I go to a big market I am so overwhelmed and usually end up with a million things I don't need, while forgetting the things I do need.  Fresh & Easy is small, but it has most things I need.  I like that they have meats and chicken that already have seasoning on it and are ready to cook.  This makes shopping extremely easy.  I also really like their brand of food, especially the pasta.  I think it's some of the best tasting store bought pasta I have had.  Don't go here if you need to buy kitchen supplies like cake pans or cookie sheets.  They simply have food, drinks, wine and beer here."
2,"I must have looked like a poor, ugly person the other day bc seriously NO ONE helped me. no one even said hi. I was in there for an hour too.  I decided not to buy anything bc the service was so bad.  this is a little bit like OJ's ""i didnt kill my wife, but if I did this is how I would do it"" in that if someone had helped me I would have bought 6 place settings- mats, chargers, napkins and napkin rings. I also would have bought several drapery panels.  but no way was I going to spend that much money at a place that couldn't even say hello or ask a girl carrying around a ton of place settings if she needed help.  so i just set everything I had gathered up over the hour in a pile and left. you're welcome employees, hope you had fun putting everything away. i also hope they work on commission and are regretting not saying hi to me."
4,"This place is absolutely delicious but you'll want to stay away on Friday and Saturday nights. It gets packed and the service declines. My boyfriend and I went a couple of weeks ago and if the food wasn't so delicious, the service would have kept us from returning. Kind of like the soup nazi on Seinfeld; you'll do whatever it takes to get what you want!"
4,"I went during the week with my two young children. We met a friend who also has a young child. Nice use of space. We didn't watch television, but it does have a few flat panel TVs that would be nice during football season on a weekend.  The space was child friendly - nice menu although they didn't offer crayons to kids, which they said they were in the process of incorporating.   Menu was huge and offered lots of traditional breakfast combinations. I had the waffle with eggs and sausage. I ordered the pigs in a blanket for my children. It is prepared with sausage that was fantastic. The perfect amount of spice and wrapped in pancakes that were also really good. My waffle was wonderful.  Really light and fluffy but with the perfect amount of crunch on the outside.  My friend ordered the French Toast, which was coated in captain crunch cereal (this sounds odd, but it was incredibly good and the bacon served with it balanced out the sweetness) and served with her choice of bacon. She ordered the applewood smoked bacon. It was excellent. They have five different types of bacon, including one infused with jalapeno, which I will try next time.  The service was a bit slow, but understandable given it was the first week of opening.  The staff was very friendly and attentive. I will definitely be back and would recommend to anyone for a nice neighborhood breakfast spot!"
5,"I recently tried vietnamese food, maybe 3 years ago.  I especially like the pho soup and spring rolls.  Since then, I have been trying every place I can that serves pho.  Out of every place that I have been so far, this place is always the one I come back to.  It's a little hole in the wall type place.  The kind you would drive by and never even notice if you weren't looking for it.  The pho has some of the best tasting broth and is a good portion.  It's about average price if not closer to the cheapest I have found.  It comes with a good sized plate of sprouts, basil, mint, lime, and jalapeno.  The spring rolls that I get have pork and shrimp in them and are a pretty good size.  The peanut sauce that comes with them for dipping tastes almost like fresh made peanut butter and has fresh ground pieces of peanut in it.  The service is fairly quick and very friendly, even with the fact that there is some language barrier.  I was actually taken to this place for the first time by an ex-coworker of mine who is an old vietnamese guy.  He told me himself that this is probably the best place he has found to eat pho at, and based on the fact that it is usually packed with asian people during lunch time, I am very inclined to believe him."
5,This is a great hole in the wall shop off of Val Vista Rd. I've been getting the chicken salad sandwich since 2006 and it's the same ever since GREAT! Cookies and bread are awesome as well...
4,"Nice place surrounded by many fast food places. No grease here!  Breads are wonderful, but customer service was just ok.  Great pastries and part of the Belly loyalty program.  Super dog friendly as well with the outdoor seating."
4,"This place just has a really good happy hour. I usually just stick to appetizers when I go but with free chips and salsa all night, I don't need much more. Their happy hour goes from 3:00 to 7:30, fantastic considering happy hours seem to be ending earlier and earlier now a days.  There are plenty of HDTV's around to keep me entertained, so I'm gonna guess it gets really busy on Sundays during football.  This is just a good place for pretty cheap drinks and decent Mexican food."
3,"The Service is great.  The food is ok.  The salsa.....horrible.  Please rethink your salsa.  Oh, and if you order a side of jalapenos they charge $1.99.  I have never heard of a Mexican restaurant charging for jalapenos.  Overall, just an ok place.  There are better options on and around Mill."
4,"This charming little cafe made my day-  the atmosphere is charming, clean, bright and warm....and the wait staff and cook were friendly and welcoming.... but the food?  the food was the best part. eclectic, delicious AND reasonably priced. I got an eggplant panini--called espaniclata or something- which came with a side salad.  The quesadilla I split with my coworker was surprising and sweet- good for a snack or dessert.  I wasn't a big fan of the chai (I stole a sip from a friend)---it was Indian, just not what I am used to- not as sweet Anyways, I went on Friday for lunch, and liked it so much I had to go back Sunday.  Again, fantastic.  I think I found a new love."
4,"There are other places in town that are less expensive with better sushi choices, and not as loud, but I had an experience today that inspired me to write here this evening.  I go to Ra (Scottsdale Rd) somewhat frequently for their lunch special which is a good deal: miso soup, yummy salad with addictive ginger dressing, a california roll and four pieces of nigiri. Good stuff. I usually upgrade to a rainbow roll and just pay the difference.  A few months ago I went to a different sushi place in Tempe. I paid with cash and when my change was returned, the server had ""rounded up"" and treated himself to a presumptuous tip (he didn't return my coins). I called the manager over, went home and wrote a bad review on Yelp, tell people not to go to that restaurant and won't return to eat there again. This afternoon I sat at the sushi bar, had excellent service, good happy hour eats, and good discussion with the young sushi chef. I paid with cash and my Ra server gave me back my change ... minus coins. I immediately got tense and thought ""great, here we go again."" I called her over to explain. She said that she had rounded-up - in my favor. I counted my bills and saw that she had indeed given me back my change plus a little extra. She said that she didn't have coins, so she just gave me the difference.  I thought that was very cool. I thanked her, and left a big tip. Now I'm writing about my good experience at Ra Sushi on Scottsdale Road and will definitely keep going there.  It's amazing how one little gesture will have such ripples."
3,"I liked the fish.  It was delicious.  The cole slaw was also very tasty.  Not too sweet.  A bit tangy.  I like that.   The shrimp was okay.  A bit rubbery, but then what does one might expect for a seafood place in the middle of a desert? My biggest problem with this place was the price of the food.  It is just too expensive for what amounts to frozen food plopped into a deep fryer.  I could buy frozen fish at the grocery store and then come home and plop it into my little deep fryer and it would taste about the same and be a lot cheaper.   I just wish it wasn't so expensive.  Especially considering this in the hood.  If you know what I mean.  I don't mind driving down to the hood for some fried fish, but only if it is reasonably priced."
1,"If it wasn't for the bad food I would go here more than once or twice a year.  The meat was dry and tough in my first entree and not edible in my second. Now when my wife drags me here to watch a movie, I order a salad only. Because they do catering, I have a suspicion that they serve up left over food from catered events to their restaurant customers.   The service is OK. They have a couple of generic draft beers. Everything is overpriced.  Caveat Emptor if you order an entree."
2,"I started a new job and the bosses brought us here for lunch.  It was ok.  I got a lunch combo meal, but I didn't pay. The service was really great but the food was not.  Just kind of plain.   It's convenient to work, so I will probably be back, I just won't have very high expectations."
4,I tried out Corleone's today for lunch and I could not believe the size of the lunch. For the money it was a great value. I thought the bread was a little soggy but it was good.  The place was crowed but the guy working was working hard. I would definitely go again.
3,"Growing up near this little hole in the wall, this place was a constant stop for my family. It's really good, greasy chinese food that basically tastes like you would expect it to. Now that I live farther away I still have cravings for their delicious orange chicken and chicken fried rice. If you're nearby during lunch try out a lunch special, really great prices!"
5,This is a great boutique in North Scottsdale.  Ruby has such cute dresses to go out in and is a little jewel box inside of this shopping center.  As the two other reviews said they carry great brands like the established Tibi or even new brands.  One  that I saw and loved from Phoenix Fashion Week was Smoke & Mirrors Clothing from Los Angeles.  Ruby carries a lot of what I saw and loved on the runway.  Ruby is always getting new stuff in so it's a great place to check in with anytime you need a dress or a kick start to your newest fashion routine. Two thumbs up!
4,"So I came here in search for Phoenix's best Macaroni and Cheese. Yep, that's right, me and the inner kid in me are in search of the best Macaroni and Cheese.  So, ordering was simple! So, how was it? Pretty good! It was more cheddary than, say, Beckett's Table (which got me started on this dance). The atmosphere was pretty cool there. However our wonderfully bubbly waitress probably came over way too much. Also, nobody coming over to refill our drinks (iced tea) could figure out that we had tea and not water. Oh well. On a separate note, I've gone by this place around 2AM it looks like a madhouse. Could be a rather interesting time around 2AM!"
5,"Yes, it is a biker bar.  And it is packed with them at certain times, especially weekends.  I don't ride. But if you roll in on a weekday around noon you might not see any, and if everyone seems to know everyone it's because they are all friendly local folks. So if you're visiting Cave Creek don't assume the Hells Angels are there looking to kick ass   Most of the ""bikers"" probably drive BMWs during the week.  I stop in at least once a week for a bite.  The food is the best bar food in Cave Creek and the service is awesome. I've been to every bar in town. Harold's , The Chip, Toad, etc. all are good, but The Hideaway is the best."
5,"I'm glad I bought my tickets back in August when the event was first posted.  I'm not sure the organizers knew what an amazing turn out they would have but the event was sold out so tickets were not available at the door.  We arrived at 11:15 (doors opened at 11) and while standing in line to get in there was a staff person checking to make sure we all had tickets and letting people know that if they did not, the event was sold out.  Once inside it was a sea of cupcakes!  Tiny cupcakes that were delicious!  I didn't taste one that I didn't like.  Liberty Market was my fave I think.  Espresso Carmel and Red Velvet!  YUM!!!  Cruelty Free Cakes makes delicious vegan cupcakes too!  I also liked the ones from Cry Baby Ranch. I'm going to have to find them again at the 20th street Farmers Market and Old Town Scottsdale Farmers Market.  And everyone was so nice!   $10 got you all the cupcakes you could eat and water AND milk!!  And it was for two very worthy causes.  Singleton Moms and Safe Haven For Animals.  There were also raffles, a cupcake eating contest and cupcake decorating for the kids.  So many festivals these days charge you to get in and then, once inside, charge for everything else.  People can't afford that these days so it was refreshing to go to an event and not be nickel and dimed for everything.  I appreciate that.  And best of all my daughter had a great time!  There were lots of people so it was a little overwhelming for her but she loved it.  Both of us are just coming down from our sugar high.   It was great to see Gabi and Lindsey manning the Yelp booth and our very own Thomas S. helping with emcee duties!   Will I be back next year?  You bet!!  And you should come too....just make sure you get your tickets early!"
5,"Excellent customer service, super clean, and the food's not bad at all.  Despite the fact that I asked for extra mayo on my sammy, but got NO mayo, was a little annoying.  But, for some reason, something told me to pick up some packets of mayo.  So I was in the clear and my annoyance never gained traction into anything that prevented me from returning.  That, and the sandwich was pretty yummo.  They also give a pickle and a free bag of chips to go with it. I do not, however, recommend the chocolate chip cookie.  No bueno."
4,"Decent farmers market with several friendly vendors. Look for the jalopeno peanut brittle, the incredible maccaroons, sweet republic ice cream and crepes from torched goodness! lots of yumminess and it is dog-friendly!"
4,Stopped in for a business breakfast. I had the Chilaquiles with scrambled eggs. It was great. It's not really on my side of town but I'd really like to go back and try some other dishes. Hefty portions at great prices. All four of us ate well for under $40 including drinks.
5,"If I was on death row and had to choose a meal for my ""last supper"" I would include the New Mexico Skillet (hold the chorizo) from Butters.  I have searched high and low for any other breakfast place that compares to Butters and I cannot find anything. I thought that I had found a close contender in Perk Eatery in North Scottsdale but a second visit proved that they were not consistent. Butters is consistently amazing. The service is strangely fast but you'd have to be crazy to complain about that. Their menu is creative and there is a really great variety of food. I always want to try the crepes or french toast but I just can't bring myself to get anything other than the New Mexico skillet. Maybe one day I'll branch out."
2,"I live a stone's throw from this Safeway and never end up here for groceries. Based on experience, if I cart my lazy ass down to the Fry's at Thomas and 44th, I end up spending about 1/4 less on my shopping trip than I do at this Safeway. Everything is ridiculously expensive, even after the ""club card"" savings.  I have no idea why. Is it because it's in Arcadia? Is it the added expense of upkeep involved in over-stocking the wine section, or the fancy olive bar, or the gourmand cheese selection? Or maybe it's the added cost of employing cashiers by not installing self-check out lanes. Do I really have to stand in line for ten minutes behind a suburbanite with 2.5 screaming childes just to buy a couple sticks of buttah?  And I understand carding, but do you really have to whip out the book to copy down my info and then make me sign my name like three times because my 16-year old self's signature doesn't match my 27 year-old scrawl? Come on, now. That's excessive. I appreciate that you think I'm looking foxy young for my age, but I'd rather hit up the crack pipe-selling liquor paloozas along McDowell than deal with this nonsense. Unless I am in desperate need of an ingredient *stat* or require something special like their amazing Mediterranean olive selection, I'm staying far, far away."
3,"I love burgers and really wanted to love The Grind, but it wasn't meant to be. Unfortunately I had problems with the temperatures, both the restaurant and the food. I was here with my girlfriend on a Tuesday night. The restaurant itself is nicely appointed, with a sleek, modern look and feel. It was pretty close to full, but staff were still friendly and efficient.  The $5/glass wine special they were running was very nice. I has the peppercorn burger with sweet potato fritters. The fritters were very nice, crunch without being greasy, and not overly sweet. The burger was nicely composed with great toppings and flavors - the watercress in particular stood out. Unfortunately, the burger was also well, well done, and I had ordered medium. I should have sent it back, but was hungry and didn't want to wait. For a burger joint missing a temperature on a burger is pretty disappointing and it killed a lot of the goodwill the rest of the ingredients had built up.  The bread pudding for desert wasn't the best I've ever had, but was nice and the bourbon sauce it came with was a nice touch.  The other issue I had with The Grind is the temp inside the restaurant. I'll grant that these are the dog days of summer right now, and I'm sure it's hard to keep the place cool with the half open kitchen, but was pretty warm in there. With the wine special it was ok value for the money I guess. But on a normal night with $10-12/glass for wine and $10 for a burger with another $4 for fries it's too pricey for my tastes, especially if they aren't hitting proper temps on the burgers every time."
5,"Business takes me out to Mesa yesterday.  After chatting with a friend about possible lunch locations, he tells me about Georges Gyros, near University and Country Club.  I decide to give it a try, as it isn't too far from my destination.  Situated right next door to Sun Devil Liquors, I'm surprised I hadn't been there before, or, for that matter, even noticed it.  I guess when I hit SDL, I've got tunnel vision.  First thing I notice is there appears to be plenty of parking, even at 12:30, for lunch.  Outer patio, stuck out into the parking lot, not overly appealing, might be nicer in the evening, I guess?  The interior is clean, plenty of seating, a small bar at one end, and a counter from which you place your order.  Never having been before, I ask the counter-person for a recommendation.  ""What's good?""  He suggests the Original Gyro, served with fries or a greek salad.  Sounds good, I'll take it with fries.  With drink, under $9.  A few moments later (actually, I saw three other tables get served, so it seemed like a longish wait), a ginormous gyro arrives, with a huge helping of fries.  The gyro was huge, overflowing with, umm, meat, gyro meat, I guess, white onions, diced tomatoes and cucumber sauce (Tzatziki, I think).  The meat was well cooked, artfully shaved, and tender.  The sauce was also very good.  The pita?  Warm, soft and tasty.  The fries? Crisp and golden brown, and piping hot, about 3-4 times the size of Mickie D's or about 1/2 a 'steak fry'.  I was very impressed with the quality of the food, the cleanliness of the dining area, and the presence of a bar.  Most folks were eating gyros, or good sized greek salads.  Other items on the menu include several different gyros, burgers, sandwiches, a decent selection of pasta dishes and all kinds of Greek and non-Greek appetizers.  I plan on coming back, perhaps before a foray into Sun Devil Liquors..."
4,"This was a brand new experience for me, but so much fun!  The staff was very patient and helpful, and we felt perfectly safe after some one-on-training even though we were all newbies.  Only complaint is that the beginner's walls were a little crowded, while there were a lot of super advanced walls not being used.  May want to swap the ratio to match the customer base.  But a very good time and an amazing workout.  It may be days before I can lift my arms again..."
4,One thing I like about this place...are the cacti! There are just everywhere! This is a great place to go camping in and to take lots of pictures of the scenery. The random people here are all very friendly and so are the staff from the Visitor Center.  The place definitely looks different when you compare from summer and winter.
2,"Strange just strange. I park here when I travel out of town. I used the valet parking once last year and don't remember any issues. Today was my second time... I dropped my car off last week. The airport shuttle was waiting for me at baggage claim when my flight landed at midnight. I went to pick up my car after a long flight as was told ""it's at the front"", the valet guy pointed and disappeared. I was left standing alone wondering if there was another side of the hotel where my car was?? I walked into the lobby and the receptionist was quick to tell me there is a balance on my account. Huh?? Number one I don't have an account at the hotel and number two I didn't stay here overnight. Again I'm standing there thinking what is going on, is he getting my mixed up with someone else? Finally he explained the parking wasn't prepaid and I needed to pay in a order to get my car. He gave me a bit of an attitude as if I was refusing to pay. Dude, it's 12:30am, I just got off a long flight & didn't realize my fiancé didn't prepay online when he set the whole thing up for me online. All this confusion could have been spared if the valet guy would have just said ""you pay at the desk"" instead of ""its at the front"" which is unclear and indirect. I think next time I go out of town ill try a different parking garage."
5,"A big shout out to Mike, the stupendously stellar bar manager.  I will be back to discuss the history of Vodka. Thank you to restaurant GM, Anibal, who stopped by to see us not once, but twice.  Enjoyed the education regarding the secretive life of truffles.  Aaron, the fantastically knowledgeable Sommelier, had me paired with excellent wine suggestions with only a few hints of my picky palette.   Appreciated the Manger of Stone Rose, Sam,  coming all the way over from the other side to dropped in and sat with us to chat about upcoming events. Can't wait to go back to try out there new bar bite menu in 2 weeks, and take advantage of the locals' secret  1/2 off bottle night on Tuesdays from there amazingly huge book of wines to choose from.   Thanks again everyone: you made a potentially disastrous date night from visiting an establishment previous which (to say the least) did not go well, into a very enjoyable and fun evening."
5,"This is my first review on Yelp so here you go... I love Yasu!!  This is by far the best sushi and authentic japanese restaurant in Phoenix.  I have been there numerous times and it never disappoints.   You have to try their Sumibiyaki which are items cooked over Japanese charcoal, last time I was there I had the beef tongue..sounds weird but its so good Nigiri/sashimi are a must.  They always have the best selection and daily special, most important...its always fresh...this is definately important!!  The sweet shrimp is my personal favorite and anything else you order, you will find the fish is sliced with great execution.   Request fresh chopped wasabi, you will never eat sushi with out it again!   Love this place!!"
4,"I stopped by early this morning to satisfy my crave for something new. The place is very clean and a man came out to greet me and was ready to serve. He clearly explained every item I was curious about since the labels were in Spanish. I asked if his name was Miguel and he said yes. I told him I read about his bakery on Yelp. Then he said that he loves Yelp and that's how word is going around now for him and he also uses to find reviews on other places. He was very friendly and had lots of patience. I was the only customer at the time and he actually doesn't mind having a conversation unlike open ended talks with others. I ended up buying 10 pastries and it cost $6.80. What a great deal! They also sell other items such as tamales, burritos, and menudo. I inquired about the burritos cuz I like mine with a little kick,but unfortunately they weren't ready yet. He showed me the homemade tortillas and he says he used them on the burritos. He said they don't look big, but he assured that the burritos are filled with red (mild) or green (with a kick) chili, shredded pork, and some potatoes. He said that one burrito is good to fill up a person. So...I must come back and try it.  So far I've had the flaky pastry with the shredded coconut and Bavarian cream...the Bavarian wasn't as creamy than I'm used to. I almost thought it would have been better off to not have it, but it's a nice added flavor when you eat it all together rather than just tasting the Bavarian on its on.  I had that curvy, pretty looking pastry which is topped with crystal sugars and with all the sugar on top, I thought it might be too sweet, but nope. It was just fine with the pineapple filling (excuse me as I wipe my drool).  Then it was off to have the caramel flautas dusted with powdered sugar. The first bite was eh. The second bite was...um. Third bite, WOW! I finally reached the part that had more caramel in it and I LOVE IT!!! Did I mention that I'm not a big fan of caramel? This caramel is sweet and creamy. It's just so good! A definitely must have for next time. That's about as much my tummy let me eat for today. I'm sure the rest will be just as good and I can't wait till tomorrow morning to try to rest of my goodies."
4,"I'm probably at TMI too often. Everybody is so nice, though, and the beer is so good. I have to admit, I really don't eat anything here but the appetizers. And I rarely stray from drinking a pint (or two) of Humboldt Brown. So, yes, I am predictable and limited. Despite my limitations, however, I love this place. It's my ""Cheers."" I am its Norm. What rocks:  Best happy hour around. Seriously. $2.50 for some of the best brews in town? Although the hemp-seed infused Humboldt is my go-to brew, I've tried the raspberry ale (refreshing without being cloying), and the yummy  ""Inebriator"" Stout (which, believe me, will knock your socks off). Good vibes, hip decor, comfortable without being pretentious. How can I not return on a regular basis?"
4,"I have been searching for a good Pho restaurant ever since Saigon Pho in Chandler went down hill.  Pho Van is a very clean, well organized, and well staffed restaurant in the Asian Center that shares space with Lee Lee's and other shops.   I had the traditional Pho Ga (chicken soup in beef broth) and Goi Cuon (Spring rolls).  Both were very good.  The noodles in the broth were perfectly cooked and had great texture and the chicken was all white meat and very tender.  The veggies that accompany the pho were fresh and crisp.  The Spring Rolls were perfect as well stuff full of healthy green veggies.   The prices were a little higher than I am used to in a pho place but it was not bad.  They also do not accept AMEX so beware if that is all you use.   Overall a great place and this is my new Go-To-Pho in the valley."
5,I'm giving Yoli's 5 stars for the winning combination of great food for a great price at a quaint location. Went there on a Saturday late in the morning and we were seated right away.  Great little hideaway in downtown Chandler.  I ordered the Morning Monte.  It was delicious.  My family ordered various other items and we all sampled a bit off each others' plates and everything was excellent.  My favorite item was the chorizo burro.  Excellent chorizo with the correct combination of meats and spices.  The waitress was friendly and we chatted with the owner and she was very nice also. Another really great thing about this place is the prices.  I don't think there are any items above $8 and most meals here are in the $6-$7 range.  Very reasonable for the good quality food you get. After breakfast we took a walk around the courtyard and had a nice time looking around at the plants and exotic birds they have on site.  We also got a chance to meet the owner of the property and she was super nice also.  I will definitely be back to try out some other menu items.
5,"Tried Roy's for the first time last night when we met some friends who rave about their Aloha Hour (Happy Hour).  Always avoided going because we tend to not like restaurant chains, but this place is a gem and exceeded our expectations. The bar area is relatively small, but very classy.  We were able to have few drinks at the bar ($5 for beer, wine, and their signature cocktails) before we were able to get a table in the bar area for 5 people...thanks to Leah and the hostess staff (you guys are great).  Didn't have a bad drink -- loved the The Original Hawaiian martini was delish, as was the mojito, jalapeno margarita, mai tai, and wine.  A friend was sad the cucumber drink she liked was missing from the menu, but sounds like the menu changes often so diners/drinkers get a chance to try new concoctions throughout the year.   For food, we tried most of the HH specials.  Everything was spot on -- excellent flavors and beautifully presented.  The tuna roll and tempura shrimp rolls were my favorites (sushi rolls), with the lobster pot-stickers being a close second.  Some friends ordered dinner...and were able to speak with Chef Bray about his recommendations for fish.  She ended up getting the Crab Dynamite Baked Barramundi, which was so yummy!  The happy rice on the side was great too.   My hubby got the Yellow Fin Ahi Poke -- something we have looked for since trying some fresh poke in Kona, HI last year.  I couldn't believe the flavors...eating poke in the AZ desert!  Its preparation with the Wasabi Crème Fraîche made it a meal we will seek out again in the near future.  Ended our meal by sharing the chocolate souffle, which was a perfect ending to a great Friday night gathering.   Definitely recommend Roy's for seafood that is excellently prepared.  Aloha Hour is a must.  Extra props to Matt, our waiter, and Leah on the hostess team for their accommodations and service.  We had a great night."
3,"I like the way they treat my dogs, really friendly staff.  They are really good about getting your pet seen in an emergency.  The facility itself is nice.  However, it feels as if they are always trying to sell me something things I don't need. This place is so expensive, we can never get out of there for less than $100."
2,"i'd rather go to amado's! the only thing that's good here is the bean dip, and i'm only saying that so that i have something nice to say."
4,"I was out shopping with my 16 year old son, and we decided to stop in and try America's. The delightful young lady behind the counter highly suggested that we try at least one thing with the pastor filling so we ordered the meal for two for $20. That comes with chips and salsa, two burritos, two tacos and two drinks The carne asada was very good...but OMG...the pastor was amazing! We just wished we had ordered the burrito with the pastor and the taco with the carne asada instead of the other way around. The sweet young thing kept checking in on us...we were there at 3 in the afternoon so it was quiet...but gosh, the young girls had just been fawning over us all day! On the way home, I looked at my kiddo and realized he's pretty darn good looking...so maybe that explains all the delightful customer service that day! Anyway, I can understand some of the complaints about it being a little pricey, but I think you are really getting a quality product and that is worth it to me. Plus, I thought the burrito was especially meaty. And as a carnivore I totally appreciate getting my meat on! Cute place, yummy food, fun day out with the teenager. Really, you can't ask for more than that."
5,"I really Love this place! I stopped in for lunch and tried a couple new things.  The Ravioli di Zucca Appetizer (see pics) which is: roasted butternut squash ravioli with parmesan, brown butter, sage and crumbled amaretti...OMG it was just delicious but a perfect appetizer to share , it's available in two sizes I got the small one. The sweetness from the crumbled amaretti is a very nice touch. I ordered the Healthy Fish again (see pics) and once again it was perfect! My guest ordered the Penne Salsiccia (see pics) which had Italian sausage, caramelized onions and pecorino cheese! The sausage was really good and for just $5 you can't beat that!"
4,"Had to write a quick review to this place.  It kicks Denny's ASS.  The food is always done well, eggs made to order, fries always hot and crispy.  Sandwiches are full of good, fresh ingredients, breakfasts are all delish. Waitresses are a good sweet/salty combo. My friend made a side comment the last time about wanting my pickle, because she had breakfast and I had a sammy. The waitress, without a word, came back to the table with a plate of the crisp briny spears. Nice xtra touch! All in all a pleasant,cheap, laid back, 24/7 diner, which is damn hard to come by in this day and age."
2,"eewh! yuck and wtf!? This Barnes & Noble Book Store sucks for sitting back, relaxing and trying to read. I know it is not a library, and I don't expect it to be. But, come on - you can at least have some sense of trying to keep the noise level down and have some cozy seating.  And... Yikes! The people here are gross. They had some couch-chairs to lounge in and they were - in all of their grossness. And they were reading magazines of all things. WTF buy it and go home and let your kids do kart wheels there. EEWH! Then, those of us who actually purchased books and were trying to peacefully read them were in the cafe' - sitting on their dirty wooden benches - where I guess the servers there think that part of theirs jobs in serving coffee is to do a drum solo every time they empty the used coffee grinds into the trash can - which was about every 5 minutes. Yeesh! Luckily, I had my iPod. It was blasting and I still could hear them banging away. It was not a very cleanly area either.  I was going to ask if they had wifi but I just high-tailed it out of there instead. This place is small too and their book selection is limited. I have been looking for a place to go to read, work and drink some coffee in my area (Arrowhead) and this one is definitely crossed off of my list.  Come here to try and find a book but don't come expecting to kick back and enjoy your novel or what have you. If you like people watching though, this may be your place. There are all kinds here. PS: and I left my fav coffee mug at this crappy place - like I will go back and get it. I think I would burn it first - bummer!"
5,Love Love Love it. The Frozen Yogurt is only 8 calories per ounce. You can get your yogurt fix and still be healthy. Also they run specials if you sign up for the deals. Then they have a punch card program as well. My husband loves going there because he can still get regular Thrifty Ice Cream.
5,"Attention all parents, nannies, guardians etc.  Koko bees is tons of fun!  The kids are all smiles & full of laughter.  Terrific environment:  oodles of play houses,  dress ups, costumes, toys, themes & settings!  The little ones imaginations can run wild.  They even offer fantastic dance, sports, yoga and tumbling classes for the children!  This is a great place to come with the kiddos!!"
1,"I got a BBQ chicken sandwich and all the bones came complementary! SICK!  I almost broke my teeth when I bit into it.  The service was even worse, the manager (I think) stood in the way of me ordering while he was talking on the phone about football for about 10 min.GROSS!"
4,"The decor and ambience was very pleasant.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.   Granted, it was a Monday night and my wife and I were only one of three parties in the restaurant.    We ordered the hot and sour soup, the puu puu platter (sp?), chicken chow mein, and the curry chicken.  Everything was terrific.  The hot and sour soup surprised me - I'm not normally a very big soup fan but I thoroughly enjoyed it both at the restaurant and as left-overs the next day.     The portions of all of the orders were very big.  We had left-overs for three additional meals."
5,"burger heaven! I had THE PIG Burger... it. was. delicious.  and it was served on a pretzel roll.  mmmmmm Good vibe feeling in Circle H, I like the pictures on the walls, the bar look, the entire environment was relaxed and easy going.  I came the day of the official ribbon cutting, so I got to see that happen (i had no idea those giant gold scissors were real scissors by the way.  i guess, that is a dumb though b/c what else would they be??) and it was nice to see everyone gathered for this moment. The french fires were piping hot and delicious, they have all sorts of sides like slaw, beans, mac n cheese etc.   I also had a bite of the brisket sandwich.  It was so very very good, I am ordering that next time I go back.   Local beers on tap, good price too. Great start for a new restaurant, there were of course the new hickups, but those kins get worked out with more time. Nothing to worry about.  That's how you learn!!"
5,Yum! Healthy selections and delicious flavors!
3,"I'm always on the lookout for a morning coffee place  and decided to stop at the Coffee Bean. Since I am always interested in trying new places, it looked inviting and clean, and was close to where I was going.They had the usual items you find in a coffee shop, and there was ample seating, with outside tables. That said, it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. However, if I am in the area, and need coffee to drink while reading my newspaper, this is a good option."
4,"I go here often. This is my kind of place for a leisurely coffee and roll. Big, open, airy, warm atmosphere. Only downside is it gets too crowded. So find your own place for coffee, this is mine!"
2,"No way am I coming back here! The shoes seem to be made poorly, but I haven't actually kept a pair of shoes and I never will because I'm never coming back. I bought one pair because I thought they were cute, but quickly changed my mind so I returned them. Do you know how many people asked my WHY I'm returning them? In a very rude manner, literally all the people who were working there. Not only did it make me uncomfortable but they lost a customer because of it as well."
3,"After all the raving I have heard about Matt's Big Breakfast and the long wait I was so excited to enjoy my food. The quality of the ingredients were high; however, the service was not so great. I felt that the waitresses were attempting to rush us out of the restaurant. I realize that it is a busy place, but their overt pushiness was not warranted.  Overall I would not go back again. The food was made with great ingrediants, but it just didn't ""do it "" for me."
5,"Bruce saved my day, my computer crashed this morning and I gave him a call and he was able to come out same day.  He went through my whole system at my office and even updated my anti-virus with a free AVG instead of paying for that crappy Norton service.  He was able to go through and recover all my files and found out the operating system was corrupted.  He saved my day and completed everything same day.  Thank you Bruce!"
5,"dr. matsumoto and her team are the best!  she came recommended to me by a friend who also goes there.  they truly care about the WHOLE child and not just their medical care.  we have seen 3 of the pediatricians in the office and they have all been great.  we developed a special bond with Dr. Miller during a very lengthy health issue with my son.  it's a 45 minute drive for us now that we've moved, but we still make the drive  to see dr.  miller because we  trust her to make the right decisions and offer the best advice for my child's health."
4,"Phoenix Muni is a great stadium to see Oakland A's Spring Training Games. Yes, it's older than many of the other Arizona stadiums, but it has a simple charm that serves it wall. Great seats can be found just about anywhere in the park, and for $22 we were in row 7, just to the right of home plate. It's also pretty easy getting in and out of both the stadium and the parking lot. The only (minor) negative is probably common to most stadiums: there don't seem to be enough vendors (at least beer vendors; several people around us mentioned it), and the concession stands can get somewhat backed up at times. But for a relaxing place to watch baseball in the Arizona sun, it's hard to beat Phoenix Municipal Stadium."
4,"Located next to T-Mobile on the Southeast corner, the parking is terrible because of the ""always busy"" Paradise Bakery.  Good prices (about $1-2 less than most other places), quick service, good manicure and decent arm/hand massage, clean place. I plan to come back try out their pedicure soon."
2,"Oh god.. I use to love this place its the closest store to me, and I have my safeway card so I'm good to go.. place is a mess.  First the parking lot.. too small for the amount of things going on at this complex, I am shocked that there isn't a daily accident in the parking lot. People are impatient, driving down the middle of the rows instead of one sides.. I just got back from there and I was making my exit and three cars tried to go for my parking spot created a jumble mess, so much so I had to pull back in the spot so they could move.. ugh.  Inside the story, they seem to always always be stocking and never seem to be stocked.. When I go I can never fully complete my shopping list, there is always something not stocked so I have to come back or just go with out it.. But today took the cake.. Its just after one in the afternoon, every single row there was at least one person stock, blocking half of the row.. its 1pm! Usually by 1, stores are stocked up, maybe one or two things to go..  There was also a cockroach.. and not to sound snobby but the type of people that tend to go to this on, I feel I need to carry mace or have a buddy..  So I may go back for quick in and out shopping, but for big shopping trips I'll drive out of my to somewhere else.. even with the gas prices.."
3,"I love this facility!  It's clean and bright.  It has an indoor track, a good number of cardio machines and weight machines.  It has an awesome indoor basketball court which sometimes gets used for extreme training and volleyball.  It has a couple of nice aerobics room, plus a couple of racketball courts and a rock climbing wall to boot.  I primarily joined so that I could lap swim.  Unfortunately, they limit the times that the pool is open to 5AM - 7AM, 11AM - 1PM, and 5:30PM - 7PM - times when there's a lifeguard available.  And during the summer, the pool is overrun with kids, and the afternoon lap swimming gets pushed back to 6:30PM start. to accommodate the local swim team.  These times don't work for me.  Also, during the summer time, it was close to 4 swimmers per lane.  The teenage lifeguards don't impose the slow to fast lane designations and don't remind people to circle swim.  I never got a good lap swim workout.  But the pool is kept up impeccably, and the locker room is nice (except during the summer time when the kids make everything sticky)  A great facility overall."
1,"Having a miserable experience flying from Boston to Reno. My connection was in Phoenix, and the flight from Boston was running a bit late. I asked both of the flight attendants if it would be possible to deplane before the other passengers as I had a very tight connection to make. One actually laughed at me and told me I would be fine. 12 hours, a horrible nights sleep (as they did not offer me hotel accommodations) and two delicious airport meals later I am sitting in the terminal waiting for my flight from Phoenix to Reno to board. Sorry buddy, not really fine. I missed my flight by 5 minutes. I would have been fine if US Airways offered their customers with tight connections the opportunity to deplane first, as every other airline I have flown on does. Will avoid them at ALL costs!"
4,"Pho is great every time, service is fast and friendly, potstickers are the best I have ever had and they are only $3.50.  Plus %10 discount for Intel employees."
5,"Vintage sodas sold by bottle, all of your grandmother's favorite childhood candy, an abundance of gag gifts and novelty items... you just can't dislike this place. Each time I'm in, I spend a good hour just perusing the countless Fred & Friends products and debating whether or not I should buy the stick-on-mustaches or 10 of the Chinese finger traps.  But, let's be honest here. I mostly go for the photo booth. By far the best photo booth in town... good quality pictures (not cheap like the ones inside the mall) and they have little masks, glasses, and mustaches-on-a-stick you can use in case you're tired of flashing the peace sign or making that horrendous duck face. Soda. Candy. Toys. Photo booth. Don't kid yourself. You're never too old for that ish."
5,"Yes, please! This place is AMAZING! I brought my family here after coming many times, and everyone LOVES IT! The wasabi mashed potatoes are KILLER! I HIGHLY recommend. I really don't know if there is anything to avoid at this place. Just love it every time! We have tried many dishes, and they are always flavorful and fabulous."
1,"The beach paradise of Ixtapa-Zihuatenejo awaited us....unfortunately, so did a connecting flight in ARIZONA of all places... Long story short....1/3 of our luggage did not arrive at our final destination, various articles of our clothing are still missing as well as my cell phone charger...not to mention security forcing us to open sealed containers of my son's baby food and milk for litmus tests... I looked on the bright side....at least we didn't get deported =)"
5,"Disclaimer: Like many of you, I am a sucker for charming little homes that have been re-purposed into restaurants. I am certain that this colored my opinion of Cibo. That being said, I absolutely love having lunch here the other day. I unknowingly arrived at 2:05 (5 minutes after they close between lunch and dinner) but was served anyway. I had the salscicia sandwich and a side of fruit. The sandwich was excellent, served on perfectly crisp, chewy saltimbocca bread. The sausage was flavorful and was complimented by roasted red peppers and onions. All this was finished off with a great quality mozzarella cheese. Really, really delicious. I should also say that the atmosphere here was friendly and  comfortable, though a bit small. This would be a great place to hang out if you lived nearby."
1,"We decided to hit up the ""Wine Down Wednesday"" that was happenin' at Tastings courtesy of KYOT.  Here's what went wrong: The event is from 6-8 so we arrived just a few minutes (3 maybe?) after 6 so we could get a spot just in case it was hoppin'.  We walked in and the hostess (she looks like she's possibly the manager or owner) asked if we were there for the event and then pointed us towards the back room where the event was being held. We walked in and there were about 7 tables and there were people at them all already.  Talk about early bird gets the worm!  We had to wait for about 3-4 minutes for the waitress to finish with a table to find out if we could sit on the patio for the event.  She said yes and that she would be right out to help us.  In the meantime another woman and her friend also took up at a patio table nearby. 20 minutes later the hostess/owner/manager looking woman came out and asked if we had been helped yet.  We said no and she left only to return with a small happy hour flier menu which she just handed from a distance and didn't even come over to our table.  I know you're wondering why I would wait the 15 minutes, but I really wanted to see just how bad the service was going to be and frankly, I just wanted some good $2 wine. It's been about 5 minutes and the same woman comes back with full, detailed menus and I asked if the happy hour flier was the deals for the event and she said yes and then asked if we were ready to order.  Um, you just gave us the menus 10 seconds ago... By now I'm ready to just order and enjoy the meal deals from the event.  I look over the happy hour flier and I see some app deals.  They said there was a specialty appetizer menu.  Not so much, but whatever.  I can deal with that.  Then I see the drink section.  The claim for the event was $2 glasses of wine.  I was excited to try some nice new wines on the cheap, but again... not so much.  In reality it was $4 glasses of house wine which only consisted of three different wines that weren't really what I was looking for.  By now, the other women that were outside decided to leave having had enough of this shenanigans.  We decided (after 30 minutes since we arrived) to go next door to Sprouts, get some apps, and have our own ""Wine Down Wednesday"" at home. I bet there are plenty of people that will have good experiences here and continue to visit happily, but this one experience has caused me to write them off for good (which I don't usually do after one instance).  I wish that I could actually review their wine and food, but the service was so poor and substandard that it's not worth giving them my money.  I understand if the food isn't good at a restaurant - some are just better or more talented than others.  However, any business can and should have good customer service.  I think this is where the cliched line of ""if I could give them less than 1 star I would"" comes in... Oh yeah, and I slapped down a ""You've been Yelped"" card as I left. Take that Tastings!!"
5,This place is awesome. Just bought a loose super powers darkseid. Will def be back for more. Lots of loose figures. Great prices and friendly staff.
4,"I grew up on Empanadas in Panama and I have been hard pressed to find anything close to them in the U.S.. today I found them!  A perfectly crunchy crust and the beef was beautifully spiced. Usually Empanadas are bland and soggy. They did a great job on these. I usually don't like rice, but the rice and black beans were wonderful.  Service was great! I'll be back!"
1,"Quick spot for a mall-made mayo-based California roll. This is where you go to learn how sushi can go wrong. You've been hard at work doing swipe-and-sign. Perhaps you even dropped a thousand bucks at Neiman's on a worthless Jhane Barnes' sweater and some silk-lined Zanella slacks or three thousand on a whats-left-of-last-season's-collection of Brioni blazer. Whatever your fancy, you're toting a wrist full of roped, glossy, shooshing-sounding bags with tissue paper sticking out the tops. You just want a break and some cool refreshing sushi. It's OK, but beware. Unagi and other ""hot"" items have a ""beep-beep beep-beep"" before they get to you. California and spicy tuna rolls come real quick -- 'cause they come from a vat of mayonnaise. Rice is not right either. Stick to tuna and salmon sashimi and miso soup. If head chef Rick is there (think Kyoto of Empire at 24th and Camelback, then Ichi Ban, University off McClintock), ask him to make you a Fat Bob on Acid, for good ol' times' sake. Or just go to Starbucks, tide yourself over, and find a real sushi restaurant. And about the Brioni... Don't sweat the buyer's remorse. It'll make a great tax deduction to Florence's."
5,"Too long.......it took me way too long to make it to Sens. Sens is what we need more of in Phoenix! Seated promptly on a Friday night by Johnny Chu himself, Johnny Chu really has put together a winner here, Johnny Chu.....alright, I admit it...I like saying his name! The Asian tapas idea is new to me, having dined at some great Tapas places from Chicago to Vegas,  but alas never an Asian tapas joint. I must say no Spanish tapas place ever made me feel like Sens did (except the time I drank a pitcher of Sangria)! The Tofu dishes are amazing. How do you learn to love Okra? Get it at Sens. The Hong Kong rice noodles were not what I was expecting so I was a little taken back by them looking like a plateful of water chestnuts. One taste was all that was needed to cure my trepidations about the flavor - fantastic! I will be back to Sens Tapas & Sake Bar soon - do you think you could invent an ""Asian Sangria""? C'mon Johnny, I know you can do it!"
4,Lash Extensions by Cher here are AMAZING  _Affordable.  _She listens to your every wish for the final product.  _Very friendly.  _Accommodating evening appointments.  _Reasonable amount of time to complete.  _She is pretty busy so make appt in advance.  I wouldn't go anywhere but here for lash extensions!  Cher is the greatest =)  aaand no I am absolutely NOT Cher haha just one of her very satisfied customers.
5,"Wow, I am very impressed. The store is very big, and they seem to have it all - even the hard to find, odd items. It looks like everyone can shop here. The store is mapped out and sectioned nicely too. Finding things is easy, and if you can't (or don't want to) the very friendly staff are there to help. It looks like they employ people who know a thing or two about the supplements also... so whether you are looking for: digestive health, immune support, weight loss, muscle building, herbs, beauty or whatever; they have it, and they can tell you about it! Pretty Good!  You can even get a customer rewards card and build up bonus points to get discounts and stuff. And they can track your purchases with it should you ever (like me) loose your receipt! What I am really impressed with though is their customer service and return policy. I did not expect them to accept a return and refund my money on 2 items that I purchased there because I lost the receipt. Especially, since I did not purchase it on a member card so they could not track my purchase either. I thought I would try my luck with it anyway and was hoping for an exchange. Well, the clerk was so nice to me. She said that it was no problem and would gladly refund my money (I didn't even ask for a refund)... and I had opened one product. I was speechless and felt a little guilty about it too - since it was almost a month that had passed (I really didn't think they'd take them back). Anyway, I told her that an exchange would be more than appreciated, and she said, ""No problem:-)"" again! So I very guiltily walked over to get some of the items I needed. They had them and they had them on sale - cheaper than I have ever seen and in more of a selection too.  Needless to say, I walked out of there very happy (but feeling a bit undeserving). But that is what good - EXCELLENT - customer service is all about - exceeding the customer's expectations!  This I my new store for all of my supplements and health & wellness needs. I recommend checking them out. They seem to have everything one could ever need. Plus, they have an entire wall (and more) dedicated to muscle, weight and fitness - if that is your thing! Also be sure to check out their website; they even have customer reviews & ratings! and product information/facts and ingredients. Really Cool!"
5,"This place gets it right from the moment you walk in the door. Signed baseballs jerseys and bats by legends on the wall, a friendly host to greet you and when you sit down they ask if you want free chopped liver. It comes with bits of egg and onion, warm rye bread and bagel chips.  Our waiter, Jeff, was friendly and attentive, even lending us his flashlight to read an old newspaper story in the rafters. The cream of mushroom soup made from scratch was superb. Our mains were baby back ribs, the specialty of the house, cooked perfectly with a flavorful sauce. The 'broasted' chicken was to die for: moist and juicy with a crispy outer skin. The fries were piping hot, as they should be. And the portions are beyond generous. We topped it off with key lime pie, light and tasty, an ideal complement to the meaty mains. And the bill was under $60, an amazing deal. As a bonus, some of the players drop in during spring training."
4,Yum! Steaks were great! Corn bread large portions definitely worth the price!
4,"Fast service, attentive waiter, food cooked as I ordered, clean restrooms...What more could I ask for? I was on my way to a meeting at the Marriott so I stopped in to grab lunch beforehand. I was in an out in less than 45 minutes. Perfect. I'll be back the next time I am at the Desert Ridge mall looking for a place to grab a quickbite to eat without ordering fast food."
5,I was at Liberty Market this morning for breakfast. The grilled bread pudding is amazing. And the bathrooms are so adorable!
4,"Green is pretty tasty with high marks for the strawberry soy shake. I do agree with the poster below that some items are hit/miss. My ""Artichoke dip"" was way WAY too spicy (I could not eat it). My 'eggless eggrolss"" were tasty but ..fluffy. They came with a sauce that i enjoyed.  This is one of the essential places for Veg food in the Phoenix area."
5,Excellent service and food            enjoyed live music on patio
4,"What The Duce!? For starters, where the heck is this place? At first, I wasn't sure if I should be walking in simply because the factory workshop look threw me off!  Um ... hello?  No worries, once we walked into the store area that's when the fun started.  This place really got my interest.  Seems to me you can purchase some vintage items and clothes.  They had stadium-seating area with a projector screen, an ice cream shake area, boxing ring, and a small gym -- where the heck am I!    We finally found the restaurant area shortly.  The kitchen is an old school food truck, then again everything about this place is old school; chairs, tables, etc.  I ordered the sliders because it was a recommendation - meatball, chicken sausage, and bbq brisket.  A bottle of coke -- yep it figures.  Meatball sliders were the best of the 3, the sausage was definitely and acquired taste.   My sis, had the eggs and avocado one and it was okay.   I enjoy my visit to the Duce simply because of it's odd ball nature.  It's definitely an experience wortha visit.  -  Enjoy!"
4,"I had my first experience with Matt's this morning. A friend of mine had seen it on Diner's, Dives and Drive In's (or something along those lines) and was excited to try it out. The wait was about 20 minutes(arrived at 9 am) and seating is very limited but worth it! I'm all about the breakfast food so I was excited to try somewhere new. The menu is limited but covers all bases. The coffee (a special blend just for them) is local as is everything that they serve. I swear the bacon tastes better when it's from around the corner. I decided on the belgian waffle and a side of hash browns. SUPER YUMMY!! I appreciate the note on the menu that they only use butter and extra virgin olive oil... No trans fats here! The hash browns were a bit oily but tasty overall. As I was leaving I saw a huge stack of pancakes on their way to a table... I know what I'm getting next time!!"
4,"How this place has less than four stars is a mystery to me. I have been 5 times and have taken out of towners here 2 out of the 5 and they all left saying it was yummy too. The El Presidential Especiale is a MUST - i order 86 the onions and add machaca/shredded beef. They are a simple yummy combination with their rice and beans. This is just straight up classic mexican food - not for the snobby. So if you want a more classy joint that's less authentic - hit up Z'Tejas cause this place is not for you. The hot salsa in the ketchup bottles is always a sign of a great mexican joint (and it's hot AND tastey - a combination not many get correct). I will say their chips can be a little on the less crunchy, more oily side but they are more than happy to replace that with some that are a little more to your liking. And their margs are delish as well. This place deserves a 4 because of consistency, friendly and accomodating atmosphere and just downright solid take on enchiladas - red sauce is spot on. Thanks Tee Pee for being our go-to for Mexican food in the Valley of the Sun!"
1,Horrible service. Barely acknowledged when you first walked in. Slow service and waited for my check for 20 minutes before getting up to go get it myself. Will not come again.
4,"If you need a hat, this is where to go."
1,"I want to like this place as it is in the neighborhood and there aren't many other options around here, but this is probably the worst restaurant/bar I've ever had the misfortune of going to.  My last trip I sat down to order a beer at the bar.  The bartender takes about five minutes to get me a beer, despite the bar being nearly empty, as he was too busy for me with his time and focus instead spent flirting with one of the servers.   I drink my beer and want another.  The glass sits empty for about five minutes while he paces around the bar.  I try on three occasions to get his attention and ask for another.  The dude is just ignoring me at this point.  I guess they don't want my business and I just leave.  He can have the 8 cents he owes me in change for a tip... I just want out of here.  I feel bad when I leave that he even got the 8 cents from me.  I hope he spends it well. On other trips here my wife and I have had the food.  It's not any better than the service sadly.  I have an English Bulldog at home with a poop eating problem and I'm not sure he would even find this food acceptable.  Overall just the worst restaurant around and it's no surprise why the place always looks so dead out front.  Nobody's there because it's simply horrible.  Avoid at all cost.  I wouldn't eat here again, but would give the bar another shot if I heard the replaced all the help.  Whoever owns this place needs to clean house.  Looking at other reviews on here, I see I'm not alone in my feelings about the service.  Get rid of these people already... just sad!!"
4,"I've been here three times once for lunch and twice for dinner. Lunch was pretty crowded, dinner not so much but tons of take out. Prices are cheap and food is good!  I love the beans and I recently tried the guacamole and loved it. Try it out and see for yourself."
4,"One of the best sports bars in the valley. Ton's of screens (although some of the big screen projectors could be updated). Nice big drafts and the food is always tasty. Try the teriyaki chicken sandwich with fries it's awesome. Upstairs they have shuffleboard and pool tables. Golden tee 2009 downstairs with another pool table. If you like loud sports bars where the patrons get into the game this is the spot to go. Plenty of fun to be had. People say too many kids but I guess I go later on at night and never have seen a problem with little kids.?. The service is on and off here, sometimes it's been great sometimes it's been useless."
5,"omg... I love this place the food is great, the selection is great, the staff is very helpful. This  is a great place to go have a few drinks and great stir fry."
4,Omg! So good! So fresh! Great burger joint. Ordered the tri-tip steak sandwich with grilled onions. The steak was tender and perfectly pink. Husband ordered the Original with fries. The burger was juicy and a good size. The fries were perfectly seasoned and fresh. We split a drink. Total bill was a bit over $14. Not a bad dinner price. Place was empty when we got here at 9:00 on a Saturday night but quickly filled up. Great service and great food. We will make The Habit a habit!
5,"Who dosen't like Cosco, I love this place. The pizza is cheap and good."
2,"This might be a good way to kill time if you're near the airport, the food really wasn't that great. It tasted cheap and like it had been sitting there for a very long time. I had the caldo 7 mares and it was lukewarm, wayyy too salty, and the shrimp were mushy. It was pretty gross. The carne asada tacos were mostly gristle, and I couldn't really taste my enchilidas with the thick blanket of sour cream over them. For $20, I could've gotten much better Mexican food somewhere else."
1,"Sadly, I have to join the crowd on this one. I was hoping that Kitchen 56 would make my memories of Vatra go away, but instead just reminded me all over again. Food was WAY overpriced and just OK. Kudos to Eddie the Server who brought with him the only charm available the second time we tried K56; I'd give him 4 stars if the review were based solely on his service & personality. I will say the interior is much better than the previous incarnation, but the spots (lights) at the counter-height 4 top shone in my eyes and made me feel like it was last call...and I don't drink."
4,"Went with a party of 10 this past weekend for my best friend's birthday extravaganza. We had teppanyaki and our chef was terrific. He was very funny, inviting, and did a great job with everyone's food. We had a range of dishes from seafood to chicken to very well done steak and our chef handled it all with his silly little giggle.  The happy hour prices can't be beat, but man once you get out of happy hour, the drink prices are STEEP! We had drinks, appetizers, sushi, and then teppanyaki. The calamari was chewy, but the bbq chicken egg rolls are great.  The drinks were yummy. I have no idea what kind of sushi we had, but it was pretty darn tasty too.  The only reason this isn't a five star review is that our server had the personality of a rock. If he cracked a smile, it might have killed him. We spent collectively close to $500 and I don't think he could have cared any less about us. Too bad too because it reflected in his tip and generally we are pretty generous tippers.  We'll go back to Sapporo in a heartbeat though. The people watching is tremendous!"
3,Not a bad place.  Pizza was good but stay away from the wraps as the flatbread wasn't meant for that.
4,"If you are a beer snob, stay at home trying to make it yourself.  If you enjoy a decent local beer in an old chandler building with a nice atmosphere give this place a shot.  The owner used to be a brew-master at Four Peaks Brewery which is a local favorite in Tempe.   I am not a fan of the over-the-top Hops that a lot of folks enjoy.  A few of the offerings here have a bit too much bite for me.  The red ale was my favorite until they changed the recipe and over did the bitterness.  Right now I get a Sun Devil Ale when I go in and it is pretty good.  They will bring you a taster if you ask and will explain the offerings to help you choose.     The food is always good.  It is a bar so don't expect 5 star cuisine.  The fries are great and the sandwiches and salads are good as well.  I haven't been disappointed with a meal yet.  Even when busy service is decent.  Enjoy the beer, watch the game and let it all unfold."
4,"This is only a Review of there men's restroom.... It was like 2:30am X-mass eve...well really X-mass.....and since I knew someone that once got busted for peeing on Scottsdale Galleria (I'm sure they weren't the first ones.)....I asked a bouncer if I could still use there restroom....and I was able too......PLUS one star oh of course there was no ""attendant"" at this time to stare at your ass wile you piss.....so that's a Plus....still not sure why you tip them for that.... If your going to pay someone to watch you pee wouldn't you rather it be a girl?  and how do you get the job to be the ""Attendant"" in the women's restroom?  oh cool Orange ""floating Sinks"" Black paint every where....lots of urinals...pretty thin between them....... cool little table things......wait wheres the trash?.... alright well I definitely recommend the Bathroom....I wouldn't drive out of the way for it.....But I'm certainly going back......."
4,"This Target gets the job done. Their shelves tend to be in a little disarray, and their makeup selections are generally lacking, but other than superfluous purchases I didn't even need to make, this Target has never let me down. The grocery section is probably the cleanest and best in the store. I love perusing these aisles. Their clothing section is pretty diverse, but because the store is somewhat small, it's packed in tight. It's a challenge to maneuver the area. The biggest perk is its central location to southern Tempe. It's also very rarely busy during the day, which is awesome!"
5,"I'm giving this Office Max five stars for convenience, friendly service, competitively priced products a stocked shelves.  This Office Max is a great in and out shop. On one side there is the detailed supply store and on the office side, there is a complete copy center. It's open until 9 on the weekdays and they don't make you feel rushed if you get there at oh let's say...8:50. In fact, they are helpful! They walked me around and helped me find the random items I needed. The copy center staff was also very friendly.  This Office Max has your complete supply of office items but their prices are very reasonable! I purchased the same item at another shop that I did here and it was significantly less expensive here.  So on that note, I end my review on Office Max but I will report back with any new findings."
4,"Went for drinks and appetizers to help benefit Friends of Animal Control and Care and was not disappointed! I am not a big fan of alcoholic beverages but this place made them fantastically. Got the Dr. Funk while my companions got Zombie and Hurricane. All were very tasty especially the Dr. Funk. MmmMMm.  The appetizers were well portioned, I got the sweet potato fries and the others got calamri and other fishy foods that I don't eat. No complaints from them so definitely a good sign.  Service was great, even though we were doing the special we still received plenty of attention. I will be back but this time to try some food!"
3,"No frills.  Nothing fancy.  Just some honest burritos and tacos.  Voted ""best taco"" by New Times a few years back (in the 90's).  Not sure I agree, but they consistently satisfy.  They make a hearty breakfast burrito too.  If you're looking for Sonoran or Tex-Mex or anything beyond what you might find at Filiberto's, try somewhere else.  The red burro combo is my personal favorite.  It's saucy (enchilada style) and just spicy enough.  Bottled beer available."
5,This is one of my favorite breakfast restaurants! They carry the best bran muffin I've ever had....it has a delicious brown sugar topping on it. I love coming here on special occasions!
5,This is thee place to indulge your sweet tooth. Great ice cream and ice cream creations from an establishment with deep roots and long pedigree in the ice cream biz.  Just can't be beat.
5,I crave their jalapeno fried rice. AMAZING!
1,I'm not sure what all of the buzz is about because this place wasn't that great! I had the grilled cheese and it was hard and dry!  There was this nasty drunk guy who sat across from our table and it was quite sickening! I will not be going back!
4,"I am a huge fan of the Italian beef and of course everyone is going to have their favorite places and tastes. But this seemed like a place to satisfy a lot of different tastes. There are several sizes, extra meat is available and if you are getting it to go, I'd say go for it! Only order it regular if you are a fan of super dry sandwiches. I'd say go for wet if you are like lightly moist but if you are a big au ju fan like I am, definitely hook it up with the dipped!! They have american, cheddar and provolone cheese (pretty sad they didn't have the mozzarella). They giardiniera was pretty good as were the sweet peppers. It wasn't too greasy or hard to eat while driving. They did have a variety of other things to eat so definitely check those out if you aren't up for a beef...but thats what they are known for!!"
3,"The coffee at this location is awful- please go get lessons from the lady at the Thunderbird and 40th street location. However, the primary morning guy, Shawn, is awesome. He is friendly and chipper, but not so much so that he's annoying as your first human contact of the day. He is generous with the toppings and speedy."
5,"I am a huge ""foodie"", from a long line of ""foodies"". I grew up living in hotels and on room service and fine dining. This is the best, very best, breakfast restaurant EVER! I have been living in Tempe for about six years now, the first two sad sad years I did not know that this wonderful place existed...after my first visit, this is my go-to, best place to recommend, favorite breakfast place to eat at! If you go on a Sunday, it will be very very busy. Everyone is super friendly. The place is very clean. Prices are amazing! Cheaper or as cheap as the nasty breakfast places or fast food. Huge portions and great quality food. I have never had a bad experience here, and to be honest...even if I did, I wouldn't care. I feel like home here. Everything on the menu is delicious! I've tried almost everything. Here are a few of my favorites (don't forget though, I love it all) : O'Pear Grenache Omelette, Greek Fetash Omelette, English Harvest Omelette, Huevos Con Chorizo (with scrambled eggs), and the Blueberry Hill Girdle Cakes (pancakes! you can order half an order or little ones...we always get an order to share at the table). Their potatoes are delicious and crispy, the english muffins are great and their homemade jam is absolutely amazing! I have bought many jars of their jam to give as gifts! Just delicious! I wish everyone knew about this well kept secret. DON'T LISTEN TO ANY REVIEW UNDER A 5 STAR! This place is the best, bottom line. Try it. You will be hooked."
1,I found Gaylee to be the most unprofessional nail tech.  I found her on an internet deal.  I called her on Sat and requested an apt on the following Friday.  She never returned my call till I reported her.  She denied my 5 messages and said she only got one msg which she couldn't return cause she lost her voice.  She conveniently had a voice after she was investigated.  I would never trust her to do my nails.  Yet reading the reviews she did return some calls.
2,"So I am an occasional shopper here at this market.. for a few reasons: we love their in-house made corn tortillas; they have a good selection of mexican treats (Bimbo breads and coconut bars) and if I'm buying conventional produce, their prices can't be beat.  Also, their pan Bolillo is really good and cheap and their cakes (3 Leches) are pretty damn good. OK, so here is where the minus comes in.. the BIG minus. My husband and I used to go occasionally for breakfast (I'd usually order simple, straightforward things like carne asada tacos.. don't get much simpler than meat in a corn tortilla).. well, the last time we did this, I found my meat... ready?... wait for it... to be the color blue and purple.  I had brown meat, but I had pieces of it that were blue and purple... no effin' joke.  I thought it was a trick of the eye, but I closely examined it and ... sho'nuff, that shit was blue and purple.  I immediately threw away my dish and never have I since ordered meat from their kitchen side. That being said, I've also become more cautious in buying meats here... not to sound like a snob, but you bet I'm not buying my next cut of beef here!  I'm cool with their breads and their cakes and tortillas and such, but if it comes to meat, I'm out the door. I much prefer Pro's Ranch Market - the REAL Ranch Market."
4,"Inspired by recent Talk, this rating simply must be updated. Fatburger has a QUALITY-quality that places it in a wierd limbo between other fast food burgers and places like Fuddruckers. If you are a fan of the king, either of the two clowns, or the red haired girl, then Fatburger is likely to feel too expensive and that it takes too long. However, 'you get what you pay for' and 'good things are worth waiting for'.   Freshness, a multitude of assembly choices, and overall quality are big standouts at Fatburger.  The employees at this location have always been friendly and courteous. Tuesdays: buy a combo, get another burger free!"
3,"Meh..not particularly memorable. I've eaten at this location and the one by ASU, though I like this location better. I would probably only eat here if I was walking by and I was starving.  The cookies ROCK though, I like that you get one with your sandwich. And they have my favorite flavor of Jones Soda (Sugar-free Black Cherry) which kicked ass.  Warning: The roast beef sandwich (Overture?) comes with horseradish sauce and it is hot as a mother.  I like the spice but it was almost unbearable. My nose pretty much turned into a snotty waterfall.  Go to Opa Grill next door instead."
2,"The service was very slow. People at several tables were waiting, far to long for, drinks checks food. The table had no bread plate , no salt and pepper. No napkins.  We had to ask for everything. The busser did not seem to understand how to set a table. We ordered the beet salad, it had no flavor and huge -hard as a rock  beets, no cheese. Tiny orange wedges.  No good.  I ordered, for a main dish the Covina, white fish. It was so salty I had to send it back. The waitress then informed me that I ordered it wrong! Last time I checked you made sure your food tasted good and wasn't toxic with salt. She informed me that it was served blackened, blackened does not mean coated in disgusting salt. My hubby ordered capellini. The shrimp were undercooked and not fresh. There was very little tomato sauce. It was bland greasy and void of any redeeming qualities. Again , like the beet salad, the veggies were not prepared correctly ...... huge lumps of tomatoes, , mix yourself?  How do you serve pasta with no sauce ? Overall I would say the chef is not talented. No one bothers to prep properly, no one is tasting the plates as they are so bad it is impossible to believe the menu is being checked and corrected. In the meantime to go back for a glass of wine and an appetizer may happen as there is some potential , just a glimmer ....and , in a few months, if enough people review, and finally .....if the owner is smart enough to stop this unfortunate cascade . The patio is pleasant, I hope someone cares enough."
4,"I have been here a few times, but mainly at dinner.  Dinner Has always been great, great waiters and staff, with a LCD TV playing almost famous famous bolywood movies.  LOL  It cracks me up when they dance.....LOL...anyhow, Great vegetarian choices for people who eat there veggies, but trust me, I am a MEAT eater,  Chicekn Tika masala, Little dry but still good.  My favorite is there Palak Paneer. Great for the vegetarian.  I have also tried there lunch Buffet for 11.00.  I give a Thumbs up..  Good, serve yourself, and pig out!!!!!!"
5,"What can I write that has not been written about the greatness of In-N-Out Burger! Maybe my love is borne of the separation from it my primary residence in Dallas compels. I hope that when it opens in Dallas (yes, the plans for that are public), nothing changes."
1,"Absolutely waste of time & space is this establishment. Don't bother checking in with the host to be seated as I saw many people just seat themselves although there was a 20 min wait for others, the staff rude, uncaring & could possibly be where all the servers go that can't get a job in any other Resteraunt. A complete disgrace & I would never give such a place my hard earned money, I suggest you do the same."
5,Ice Ice Baby... Ice Ice Baby... All right stop collaborate and listen; Ice Now is here and it's got my attention  Make some drinks - not warm but frosty; And believe me when I say they are not costly Will it ever melt? yo I don't know. Give them a call and they'll show To the extreme I yelp like a sandal; Ice your drinks and get lit like a candle ... Ice ice baby PS - not sure where the sandal line came in but writing a review in lyric form is a challenge!  This is the best I can do for now... Need ice for an event?  Call Ice Now! They offer free delivery and their pricing is surprisingly cheap. And good luck getting the Ice Ice Baby lyrics out of your head... (sorry)!
5,I LOVE THIS PLACE I JUST CAN'T NOT GET ENOUGH OF NCOUNTER! the vibe is young clean and fresh.  the good is so delish.. I keep telling all my friends to go here for brunch (:
4,"In the world of Mongolian BBQ near my work, there are 2 contenders:  Stir Fry Paradise and AJ's Mongolian (formerly and possibly partially still YC's...).  I prefer Stir Fry Paradise because it has never been incredibly packed, and their meat resembles meat and not frozen tubes of meat shavings.  The small ""bonus"" buffet offers more food if you aren't crippled by all the food you crammed into your bowl.  I like the cream cheese wonton triangles, they rock the body that rocks the party.   Yeah, they are a little pricier if you tack on a soda.  Just drink  water and then tweet to the world how progressive and off the grid you are by not being a ""soda drinker"".  I haven't quite gotten my ""sauce mix"" down yet, but that will come in time.  That's the beauty of these places, if your food is bland then the only person you have to blame is yourself and your lack of sauce mixing artistry."
3,"I have been to this place twice and I have had both extremes.   The Good: Shannon, California Sea Bass, Michelle (Manager's) Customer Service The Bad: Fried Calamari, Our last waiter's breath The first visit to this establishment was our encounter with Shannon.  Shannon was a pure delight as our waitress.  She made our first visit absolutely fun.  My wife had a tilapia dish that she was less than enamored with but I had the California Sea Bass and that tasted very good.  In fact, it was so good that I regretted not getting a glass of Chardonnay to go with it.  The fish had a very nice texture and taste. Our second visit was our first encounter with the fried calamari.  As our guest so eloquently said, ""If this was my first impression of fried calamari, I would not have liked it.""  The calamari was overcooked and there was so much oil running on the plate.  We called this issue to Michelle's attention and she agreed 100% that the dish was not prepared properly.  She gave us a coupon to come back there and eat at any time.   However, our waiter's breath was another story. Whenever he spoke, I could smell his pungent (trust me, a lot better than what I really wanted to say) breath to the point I almost donned a gas mask.  There are very few things that would cause me to lose my appetite.  His malodorous breath and the calamari with more grease than a Jiffy Lube accomplished the feat."
4,"It's hard to rate this place because you never know what you're going to get. At it's best, I'd give it a clean five star rating. But, at its worst, the service is slow, and the bizarro factor knocks it down to 2 or 3 stars.   What has the ability to take this place up a notch is karaoke. It draws a diverse crowd of headbangers to rappers to punks to cowboys, which is where the bizarro element comes in. Sometimes the mesh is weird and amazing in the David Bowie meets Trent Reznor way, other times its odd and off-putting.  I'd say scope it out on a given night, and if you don't immediately get a good vibe, roll across the street to The Coach House and grab a cheap pitcher and come up with a new plan for your evening."
4,I love this place. The service is absolutely amazing. They are always really friendly and never screw up my order - - things that are very important when it comes to fast food. Their Apple Walnut Chicken salad is amazing! I also crave their fried zucchini on a steady basis. Carl's Jr has some of the best fast food burgers out there... if you want something fast and GOOD then I think you should stop here.
5,"What's not to love? Herb n Flavors uses local, high quality ingredients, the food tastes GREAT and they are vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free friendly! I especially liked their vegan spinach and artichoke dip! We will definitely be back soon : )"
2,"My experience was on a random Saturday afternoon, and I think that might skew my opinion a bit. During my visit we were the only guests dining.  There was one guy at the bar that was friends with the employees.   The atmosphere is mellow.  And I can imagine it being a pretty happening place on weekend evenings. The prices were a bit high for what we ate.  I had a pita sandwich and it was just under $10.  The lunch prices are a bit steep. The food was okay, but nothing I'd go back time and time again for."
1,"So a friend of mine went here last Friday, and they were double charged.  The bartender took advantage of the situation and threw out the receipt to avoid cancelling the $60 amount. Which she claims and assumes was her tip (on a $60 bill). ""I get a 100% tips!"" umm..yeah.. I think I will skip this place for sure!"
4,"Been to the Spotted Donkey in Carefree multiple times and always been happy.  (can't speak to their new location on Hayden as we haven't been there yet).  The drinks are very good, if a bit pricy and the apps are wonderful.  Ordered the short stack of nachos, stuffed peppers and enchaladas this time.  All very good and tasty.  One note, everything seemed to be a bit ""saucier"" this time, especially the nachos.  While the sauce is very good and tasty with a good amount of spice, it was a bit mcuh for me.  I don't remember it being that way before so perhaps this was a fluke. Will definately be back"
1,"I just thought I'd post an update.  I planned never to go back, but was with a friend who really wanted one of their breakfast items.  I skipped ordering ANY food whatsoever and merely ordered coffee and watched her eat.  As fate would have it, she had a BACK HAIR in her scrambled eggs (we are 2 for 2 now).  My gag reflex is going off as I type this.  My husband, friends, and I have renamed this place the Black Hair Diner, and we've decided they have actual black bears cooking in the kitchen, since they can't seem to keep black hairs out of their food."
4,"Blue Martini hosts ""Take The Stage And Be The Lead Singer Of The Band"" on Monday Nights. Usually there is a band that sings top 40 but on Monday nights anyone can go up there and sing. My friend loves karaoke and was dying to get up on stage and have her moment so I went for moral support. BTW she rocked! Most bars are dead on a Monday so I was surprised that there was a decent crowd here. No cougars in sight the whole night! The drinks specials aren't that great but you can get $7 specialty martini's or if you go with a group of people you can split a bottle of vodka for $100."
1,"I hadn't been to Fuddruckers for about 20 years... now I know why.  Cashier was nice and very helpful.  I ordered bacon cheese burger combo.  Fries were only warm, not hot.  Burger was not very tasty and it was full of gristle bits... you know the ones that stick between your teeth.  Lots of trash on the floor.  After we were finished, someone came to ask how things were.  I told here about the fries and she offered to get me more; I declined.  She offered a free dessert: I accepted.  In all, not a good experience, will probably be at least another 20 years before I go back."
5,"WOW!!! practically half price on everything compared to the chain stores.  Staff is always very friendly and helpful, and i've literally saved hundreds of dollars since I discovered this store just under a year ago!"
4,"Indian food is often minimized by attempts to make it less exact and somehow more palatable by other cultures.  This is at the cost often of not allowing the original beauty of the cuisine to be savoured by all. In fact, my visit to the Indian Paradise was not without some sarcasm and pessimism on my part given that so many places in the area get it wrong when it comes to this genre.   Boy, was I wrong!  Don't let the fascade of the place fool you.  When you enter, it takes a few seconds to smell the fact that you are going to have the genuine article here.  If you go at lunch time, you can experience the buffet.  I went on a Sunday afternoon and the place was perfectly poised for a sunset dining experience. ALL the food...from the nan to the lamb curry, to the tea, to the samosas to the califlower....EVERYTHING was really good.  But I have to also add that there was a certain family-like atmosphere created by the staff and the service was unassuming yet intuitive.  I found that I did not want to leave.  I just wanted to stay here and talk and snack a little.  That's kind of hard to achieve in a strip mall restaurant yet, this did not feel like that. You should go for yourself and see if I was just way too nostalgic for good Indian or whether its really worth 4 stars."
5,"I love me some coffee. The french roast brew is perfect for surviving a long day of work. If you want something sweet, order the iced raspberry mocha. Just the right amount of sweetness without tasting like you're drinking syrup. The muffins are moist and delicious. The spinach salad here is surprisingly amazing (yes, they make spinach salad at this coffee place). The best part about this place? It is not full of hipsters and college students who hog all the decent seating and never leave. I can't wait to go back to try all of the other drinks offered."
3,"The restaurant has 6 tables which make it possible for you to eat-in, but this place is definitely more suited towards take out or delivery.  Just don't expect service if you eat-in.  You order at a counter and if you choose to eat-in, you will get your soup in a take out container, eat on paper plates and styrofoam cups, but get your entrees served on platters. The house special won ton soup was pretty tasty and was loaded with a variety of fresh veggies, as well as chicken, pork, and shrimp pieces.  However, one key ingredient was missing - won tons! General Tso's chicken was fried and served with broccoli and sufficient sauce.  The Mongolian beef was more Mongolian and less beef. Overall the food was OK, except for the disappointment of the missing wontons, and I would probably consider this place again for delivery."
5,Postino's in Gilbert was stunning! Amazing outdoor/indoor chic atmosphere.  Food and wine were excellent as expected! What another great addition to the Postino family! Loved it!!!!!
5,"Teresa S. and I were one of the lucky ones to win tickets to see Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci last night at the Symphony Hall, and we were impressed with the acoustics. The overall sound quality of the live act was fantastic, so overall I'd say that the gig was pretty amazing. It's a fabulous hub of culture, but the food concessions need some urgent attention. The only munchies they have are desserts like cookies or pies, so be sure to have dinner first. One of the great things they offer is you can now pre-reserve your intermission drinks. You can pre-order your favorite libation before the show, and they will have them ready on the refreshment table.  That would save you time in case you need to whiz to the loo, and not have to wait in line again to buy your drinks. Thank you again to Yelp and Arizona Opera. The show was wonderful."
3,"First time ordering calamari salad...which had a strong onion (??) flavor and tasted weird...Being raised on Vietnamese food, the strangest of foods has been in my mouth, but I think this falls into the acquired taste category...As in I never acquired a taste for this. Pad thai was okay...the noodles were a bit over seasoned. I felt like I should've eaten it with rice to tone down the flavor. Papaya salad was good...still on the look out for that authentic not watered down version, though. Just like my friend's mom makes it! Yum! Thai omelet. Good. The people were really friendly as well, which helps, but you KNOW I'm all about the food. I had takeout and the box for the calamari salad read: ""Carimali Salad"". :) I love it!"
5,Our family have used this Discount Tire for 11 years now.  Amazing service and warranty on tires.  Thank you!
5,"In Phoenix for a concert and felt like Thai. Found this place on Yelp! and decided to check it out based on the reviews and the fact that it was near the friend we were visiting at the time. The restaurant is in a strip shopping center that we never would have noticed (or found) had we not been looking for it. Oh, but what a magical dining experience! The cashew chicken was the best I'd ever had (and we eat Thai a LOT!) and the chicken satay was exceptional. Loved the veggie Pad Thai and my husband got a vegetarian (tofu) curry dish he loved. Wish this place wasn't 400 miles from my house. I'd be eating here every week!"
4,"Sushi and birthdays go hand-in-hand. I returned to Phoenix just in time to hang out with my friends for my birthday and they took me here. This place gets packed during happy hour for their half-priced sushi rolls and great drink specials.  Stingray is a beautiful restaurant in a high-class location. The patios are spacious and there is a lot of seating indoors too.  The sushi is well made and I will return...however, during happy hour. The prices jump up and the place gets empty once happy hour is over."
4,"This was our last stop on the Urban Wine Walk yesterday, and it was a great place to end the day.  Because this was our last stop, we were too late to get the wine special, however we decided to stay and grab a table on the gorgeous patio and get a (full) glass of wine.  We also ordered some sweet potato fries to munch on. The patio was awesome and I love how the ""inside"" opened up to become an extension of the patio, or vice versa.  We were lucky enough to be experiencing one of those perfect Arizona days and I felt like I was sitting in a good friend's cute, cozy backyard . . . with table service.  Speaking of the service, no complaints from me! The original plan was to get dinner, but the wine, fries, and good conversation were enough to fill us up and take us to the end of the night.  I can't wait to go back (soon, to enjoy the patio) and try all of the delicious food I was reading about on the menu and now in everyones reviews!"
5,"I never write these things. But I have to say that you will not be disappointed with Paletas Betty. Especially with the weather right now, it is a delicious and healthy treat, made with seasonal ingredients. I highly recommend the limón amarillo when in season. Delicious frozen lemondade/lemon drop on a stick, tossed in a sugar rub. It is for certain served in heaven. That is all. P.S. check out the hours, yo. You know what's up."
2,"Stopped here for lunch with my BFF today. Nowhere to park, forced to valet, meh... Love the atmosphere here: classy decor, beautiful patio. Everything on the menu looked delicious. I had a hard time choosing between many foods that I love: crab cakes, goat cheese, crepes... I wanted something lighter so I ordered the oriental chicken salad. In the meantime, our drinks were brought to the table. BFF pulled the spoon out of her iced tea to find that there was some leftover peanut butter still on it. The question is: who left it there? Don't know. Gross. This was pointed out to a server (not ours because she had not returned to our table). Our server brought out a new iced tea. She was polite, but not necessarily apologetic.  When our meal was delivered to the table, BFF pointed out that there were tomatoes on her sandwich (she asked for no tomatoes). The server said that the other server probably grabbed the wrong plate. She came back from the kitchen twice to tell us that the new sandwich would be right out. So, I sat with my salad and waited to eat until BFF got her meal (It took a good 5-10 minutes for her new sandwich to come out).  BFF raved about the dressing on her side salad. My salad was fine, but nothing to rave about (especially not for $13). The ingredients were fresh but the ""shredded chicken"" that was described on the menu appeared to be sliced chicken breast. To be honest, I prefer shredded chicken which is why I had decided on that particular salad. DISAPPOINTING. The server arrived at the table to ask if we wanted to order dessert. We replied, ""no, thank you"". And she said something like, ""oh, come on, are you sure?"". Again, we declined but I really think she should have offered us free dessert after our bummer lunch. The topper? 1 valet guy and 6 people in line to pick up their cars=a 10 minute wait just to leave the place.  I would hesitate to come back, but that menu is just so damn tempting."
3,"My parents love pho so I've practically been enjoying Vietnamese cuisine since the womb. Ha! No wonder I love it so much myself that it was always on the weekly dinner rotation when I lived in OC. Alas, I moved to North Phoenix and I dont have little pho shops or boba cafes on every street corner. I've learned that I have to drive a ways to Chandler/Mesa to satisfy these cravings. Imagine my surprise when the husband and I noticed Tea Lite Cafe when we changed up our movie theater location this past weekend. Of course, we had to try it out and we'd been dying for some pho for months now. We both ordered the beef pho and took a seat. The place is small but there's plenty of seating and still feels spacious. The cashier up front was super friendly and welcoming which was nice. We didn't have to wait too long for our food to arrive...another plus.  The pho itself has really tasty broth and the beef was nice and tender. I was disappointed by the small portion of bean sprouts, mint leaves and limes that accompanied the soup. I'm used to overflowing plates of these veggies so I can load up my soup to my heart's desire. In fact, my hubby usually counts on me doing this since I end up eating all my veggies and leaving most of the beef for him. Double ha! But the lack of sprouts and mint leaves didn't put a damper on the great taste of the pho. What I did miss was the traditional pho ingredients like tripe, rare steak and tendons. I know, I know...sounds intense but trust me it makes pho taste soooo good. I guess I just have a usual when it comes to pho so I was a little disappointed when I couldn't satisfy my craving to the utmost degree. Woe is me.  But let me conclude by stating again that the pho here is really good and has a great flavor to the broth. I think the hubby and I will go back since it is so conveniently located to us. It'll definitely do in a pinch although I am sure I will occasionally find myself making the trek to get me some tripe!"
5,"So much food for so little money, and they have kids meals that the kids will actually eat.  If you do not like what they offer in the cafeteria you can get food downstairs like Pizza and hotdogs...what kid does not like Pizza or a hotdog? I had the meatballs and mashed potatoes and they were so good.  I wish there was something bad to say about eating in a furniture store cafeteria, but there really is not - it was great food, great service and fun for the kids (there is a play area with a TV that they can eat at too (so the parents can enjoy their food too) My wife had the herb chicken and it looked great too, and she said it was really tasty too.  She loved it.  The desserts were amazing too, and very filling --- SO MUCH FOOD for SO LITTLE THE MONEY! I wish it was not so far away from Queen Creek, or I would hit it up so much more often!"
3,"Sports Authority is like the Walmart of sporting goods stores. No, wait, that would be Big 5. I guess they are more like Target. Reasonable prices, and products that don't completely fall apart the first time you use them (but they are still made in China) and no service whatsoever. And Dick's is more like a Dillard's or Macy's because they have the higher end brands and employees that are older than 16 or 17 years old. So then I guess Bass and Cabela's would be more like Nordstrom's? That's where the really nice stuff is but you usually walk out without purchasing anything unless they are having a sale. Except Cabela's is sort of specialized so I think that would be more analogous to something like an Ann Taylor. Ok, I know I have gone way off topic here but I think I have made it abundantly clear that I am not a regular customer. But I do occasionally come in to buy gifts for family and friends. On my most recent visit, I came in, wandered around for about 20 minutes and then found what I needed (with no help whatsoever from staff), paid and left. A two star experience for sure but I have to give them an extra one since they offer a discount when you check in thru the Yelp app on your smart phone and so that saved me 10 bucks."
2,"I had a good bad experience while at Cadillac ranch. The inside decor was pretty cool and had comfortable booths, which I appreciate. We ordered three different appetizers that were  on happy hour before our entrees. The Wontons, the queso dip, and the Chicken tenders. The tenders were good. They were beer battered and  tender. The queso dip was pretty bland and the chips awful. They weren't stale but just obviously super low quality. The Wontons were obviously frozen and sitting on a bed of syrup. It was like having desert and appetizers at the same time. When it came time to order entrees i was the last to do so. I asked my server about an option between three entrees and she danced around all of them suggesting that I have a pulled pork sandwich that was clearly less expensive than the ribs, steak or taco plate I inquired about. I should have headed her advice. It isn't every day a server tries to under sale you I ordered the ribs and was disappointed. the texture was off the flavor was bland except for the sauce which was spicy and not good enough to mask the bad flavor. My server Liz was awesome. She was attentive and friendly. She noticed I hadn't eaten my entree and took it away. The manager came back and was apologetic he offered me another entree and I took Liz's advice and got the pulled pork sandwich. It was much better. The staff was good and did there job very well. It isn't their fault the food quality is so bad."
1,"Buca Di Beppo is literally, italian restaurant hell. You know how all big box chain restaurants throw junk up on the walls in an attempt to make the space feel vintage? Buca Di Beppo throws junk, and knick knacks and statues and anything else 'italian' they could find in the chinese warehouse where they loaded up these goods. It's a terrible horrible mess and you end up sitting in a yardsale of italian paraphenalia while eating your very bland pasta. It's embarassing how truly flavorless the food is here. Thin, flavorless alfredo sauce. Thick slabs of lasagna with less taste than what I can get out of the frozen section at Publix. I went with a large group and across the table, bland food. When they seat your party, they guide you through the kitchen area where the cooks play along and say a welcoming hello. Deep down you know they hate this. Why are we in the kitchen? Sure it's nice, but I'd rather have them concentrating on making the food, and making it good. Of course, the food at Buca Di Beppo seems to be far beyond any point of return to tasting good. It's just dead. Dead food. No life, no flavor, not emotion. I get more flavor from the $.99 Michelina's frozen lunch package. Far from claiming anything authentic Italian, Buca Di Beppo even pumps out bread with no taste. Eating at Buca is like eating food from an assisted living facility. No salt, no sugar, no butter, no fat, it's all gone along with anything resembling taste. Sure, Buca has huge portions, and the setup is nice for large parties and families - but they might as well just buy the family-size pasta packs from the frozen section and bake it at home, even that would be better, and they wouldn't have to the mandatory gratuity. Say what you will about other italian chains like Macaroni Grill, or Olive Garden - at least their food taste like something."
5,"Went back, they appeared to have remodeled and noise level was greatly reduced.  Food, atmosphere, everything still wonderful.  In my first review, I stated ""the only reason I'm giving it less than 5-stars is because of the noise level.""  As the noise level issue appears to have been rectified, my review is subsequently being modified to reflect this. Last time I was there I had a salmon salad, which was good though in all honesty the salmon was the star of the dish.  I asked the server to please ask the chef how the salmon was cooked so such perfection.  I honestly did not expect for any type of response.  Lo and behold, a gentleman came out and explained the procedure utilized to get that sear and texture without overcooking or under-cooking the salmon. Re: Another reviewer's issue with ""soggy fried calamari"" It is tempura calamari, which is different from other ways to fry the calamari.  I have never had any issues with sogginess unless I leave it to sit for too long.  Hmm...  Clearly, they prefer Zinc Bistro.  Honestly, I haven't been to Zinc Bistro so I cannot draw a comparison at this time between the two. I will definitely go back as soon as I can to The Greene House -- Oh, loved the recent press on the Chef's high praise, it *is* well deserved!"
5,"I love this place! We weren't sure what to expect since the restaurant is in an office building plaza.  Kinda weird, but the employees in the other businesses are lucky! We went in here on a whim after reading all the awesome Yelp reviews.  Our first impression was a girl at the front and she was super nice and didn't rush us while we were checking out the menu options. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with macaroni & cheese and my husband ordered the brisket sandwich with a side of baked beans.  He also ordered a side of ribs to sample.  The wait wasn't too bad -- it took about 10 or 15 minutes and it was ready to go.  They are cool with their sauce and let you fill up the small plastic cups and take as much as you want of it (which is awesome, because the sauce tastes SO good!).   It's a nice, thick sauce and they have several flavors to choose from. We go to a nearby area to have a little picnic by ourselves and notice that they forgot to include the side of ribs.  We pack everything up and go back to get those.  The employees were really nice about it and apologized and gave my husband the side of ribs.  We repeat the same process and realize that they also messed up my husband's order and gave him a pulled pork sandwich instead of the brisket sandwich.  We decide to let it go and eat our food. The pulled pork has great flavor.  The meat actually tastes like it has been smoked for several hours and is good enough to eat on its own without any sauce.  However, we weren't going that route, because the sauce is too damn good not to eat.  The baked beans and macaroni & cheese were not anything special, but they were good.  The ribs were our favorite part!  We absolutely loved them.  Very tender and the sauce they chose to slather them in was delicious. This place is pretty far from where we live, but we would definitely go out of our way (again) to eat here more."
4,"The best caesar salad i have ever had. The scallops were tasty, but not as crispy as I like them.  My husband loved his steak. The chocolate lava cake is amazing.  Instead of a little oozing chocolate, there was a lot of oozing chocolate.  And their house chantilly cream is to die for.  I could eat it alone, by the spoonful."
2,"We tried this out last night. We won't be back.  There is no indication when you walk in that it's a seat-yourself restaurant. We stood like idiots at the hostess area until somone asked us if we needed something.  We sat ourselves, and then sat and sat and sat because there was no server assigned to us. Perhaps that is a reason to seat patrons, so a server knows they've arrived? Finally, the hostess asked us if anyone had helped us, and she was very polite and took our order.  Our drinks came out fairly quickly, but then we waited and waited for our food. This would have been understandable if the placed had been packed, but it wasn't. It was maybe 75% full (7:30 on Saturday) and there seemed to be plenty of servers. There was one large party on the patio. I ordered the vegetarian salad (can't remember what it was called) that advertised avocado, jicama, beans, and other yummy things. When it arrived, there was a tiny little mushy sliver of avocado perched on top, and no more to be found. It was as if someone scraped up the dregs of an avocado from the rind of an empty one and flung it on my salad. It would have been more forgiveable if they had just forgotten it altogether. Also, the white beans were undercooked.  The pizzas were good. I ordered the local organic vegetable one without cheese, and it came loaded with summer squash, roasted carrots, olives (local? Hmm...), leeks, roasted onions, and the crust was thin and crispy. My husband also enjoyed his pizza.  I should actually grant an additional half star to the hostess/waitress, who comped my salad when I complained about it. I was willing to pay for it, but she offered to take it off the bill.  The final nail in the coffin was perhaps not the fault of the restaurant, but the large party out on the patio had 3-4 elementary-age kids literally running laps through the restaurant for the first 15-20 minutes we were there. If ignorant parents are content to let their hellions ruin other diners' experiences, then I'm afraid it's left to the restaruant to politely and discreetely ask the parents to please reign them in. No such luck.  Anyway, this place has some things to work on. Fortunately for us, there are too many other great businesses nearby for us to give it a second chance."
4,"Seriously, their happy hour prices can't be beat.  A beer, a spicy tuna roll, calamari and avocado egg roll for under $20 including tip.  Service was attentive and friendly.  We had to lurk around the bar area for awhile to get a table, but that only speaks to how popular this place is.  If you are looking for an inexpensive dinner out that doesn't involve Denny's or Olive Garden this is a great choice."
4,"This place is busy, had live music in the bar, and the servers were trying to squeeze by.  The seafood is flown in DAILY and I think our bill helped fund a grouper or two's first class seat.  I ordered the grouper with crab on top (as an extra- you can ask for it this way).  Ordered the lobster mashed again, and green beans (if it ain't broke- don't order something else.).  Had a great night!"
4,Absolutely delicious food at reasonable prices. Only complaint is that they only sell cans of soda. This kind of meal requires a big old drink
3,"Very nice happy hour. Its dark inside but the beer prices are good and they have free sliders, chips and salsa."
3,"My first visit to Picazzo's is not what I had hoped it would be at all.  A few of my friends who have fine taste in food raved about it and so I had high hopes.  Let me start by saying, I'm not really a gourmet pizza lover.  As a teacher, I have plenty of Domino's and Pizza Hut all the time, and can be quite happy with that, either that or I love a great slice of New York style pie.   Since I am not a huge fan of gourmet pizza and the overabundance of toppings, I checked the menu for a nice plate of delicious pasta.  I was incredibly unhappy to find that they had about 6 pastas and they all sounded bland and/or too strange to order.  Then, I found their sandwich section.  I decided on their Spicy Chicken sandwich that sounded perfect.  But it took awhile for our waitress to come over, so I glanced at the pizzas and found a couple that sounded good too.  Thank goodness I did, because as I ordered the sandwich, the waitress informed me that they only serve the sandwiches at lunchtime!  What?!  That really peeved me off.  What is irritating is on the menu there is a clear line between the section that says ""Lunch Specials"" and where it says ""Sandwiches.""  I mean, there is an actual black line drawn between the two...to me, that says that they aren't a part of lunch.  Don't you think?   Instead I ordered the Popeye and Olive Oyl pizza, which has a white garlic sauce, spinach, artichoke hearts, garlic, Kalamata olives, carmelized onions, mozarella, Roma tomatoes, and Applewood smoked bacon.  After I ordered it, I really thought how I truly didn't even want it.  I was really irritated.   My husband and I both ordered our own pizza since we couldn't agree on what we wanted, so he got The Vortex, which basically had all the meats you could possibly think of.  For an appetizer we ordered the garlic cheese bread, which was way too garlicy.  It came with olive oil for dipping...I would have preferred some marinara sauce or something.  After I had ate the bread, I really didn't want my pizza b/c of knowing that it had so much garlic.  I picked a lot of the garlic cloves off along with most of the other toppings...there was just too much on it.  I know for some, they would probably like that...but it just isn't my thing to have too much on my pizza.   All in all, the pizza was pretty good, once I picked off half of the toppings.  The crust was really tasty and had the perfect crispiness and softness to it.  I could have had just had that alone and been happy at that point.   My husband and I both agreed that it won't be a place we go to again, unless it is for lunch time, so I can try the sandwich my mouth had actually been watering for."
1,"Needs a new name - now.   The Pischke's of old had such a sad ending.  I appreciated McGrath's effort to keep ""Pischke's"" alive.  But it is nothing, nothing, nothing like the Pischke's of old.  Call it ""The Blue Ribbon Cafe"" - take out the PIschke name - I can't imagine that Chris PIschke would have been honored to be remembered this way.  If his restaurant was a reflection of who he was as a person - Pischke's Blue Ribbon Cafe would be the exact opposite of who he was.   The current restaurant is not a laid back, family friendly and yet a bar all at once restaurant that serves an unending array of crazy good sandwiches/salads/etc - the current decor is pretentious, and the food matches that."
2,"Meh. Maybe it was just that we decided to dine in 10 minutes prior to closing, but I was definitely not impressed. I had not been here in ages. Probably 10 years, maybe 15. No exaggeration. I remember nothing but good things about Miracle Mile. I remember being excited to come eat here.  So one night while shopping at Arrowhead with a friend, I got a sudden craving for a pastrami sandwich with coleslaw and Thousand Island dressing. I was very excited to walk in and find that it was on the menu! I didn't have to special order it! It was a good size sandwich.  Big enough that when cut in half, you still have to use both hands. I took my first bite and was immediately disappointed. Not that it was bad. It's just that I had fond memories of this place and I was really expecting something near the level of perfection of the #19 at Langer's in Downtown L.A.....or at the least Like Gandolfo's in Tempe. Nope. It was nowhere near as good as either restaurant.  It was just okay. The bread had a slight toughness like it was day old bread. The meat was chewy and lacking flavor. The coleslaw was really good and had the perfect crunch. The flavor of the coleslaw was not strong, but still masked the flavor of the pastrami. I will stick with Jason's or Heidi's next time I have a hankerin' for another deli style sandwich."
4,"This is a delicious neighborhood restaurant! I can't speak to their sushi much because I have become such a fan of other items on the menu. The handful plus times I have had sashimi here it has always been good. Now on to my favorites! The Asian nachos are a must get. Instead of tortilla chips they use wonton chips. Topped with a yummy cheese sauce, salsa, sour cream, and guacamole. Their guacamole is a mix of avocado and edamame. Yum! Add some chicken and these are super yummy and great for sharing. During my most recent visit here I discovered they have a new edamame. Bun Bo Edamame. It's very spicy. Too spicy for my tongue but the friend I was with loved it. Saved the best for last - the Mojo dessert. I am not a big dessert person, but I almost always order dessert here. It looks like a sushi roll. You get rice krispy treats, rolled up with Nutella, ice cream and a brownie in the middle. Delicious!!!"
5,"Best cupcakes ever. I can't get enough of the Strawberry and Red Velvet. They even have a gluten free Red Velvet! Order several to take home. They will give you a zip-loc bag that keeps them fresh and moist for days! I'm addicted. Not cheap, about $22 for 6 but when you taste them, who cares...."
1,"I purchased a pair of Naot Paris sandals ($160 with tax) at The Shoe Mill.  I considered buying on-line, but decided to shop locally instead.  I ended up paying more, but assumed that I was paying for the superior service.  I wore my new shoes to work on Friday.  By the end of the day, I had developed blisters on both feet near my toes and my ankles.  I was surprised because I had read many reviews stating how comfortable Naot sandals are and the salesman who helped me confirmed that I was buying the correct size.  Sadly, I took them back to the store the next day.  To my surprise, I was told that The Shoe Mill does not take returns.  I have never tried to return shoes, so it didn't occur to me to ask this question when I made the purchase.  However, as I stated, I expected full service from a high end shoe store. I will no longer shop at The Shoe Mill.  It's been three days and my feet are still recovering.  It's a constant reminder of how dissatisfied I was with my purchase.  I will definitely shop Zappos next time."
4,"I had a date in January here with Jen.  We got the meat pizza, which was great.  I thought our date was pretty good, but wasn't quite up to the hype of our texting and online chatting.  She was very talkative and definitely an adventurous extrovert.  She lived in New York (Appropriate NYPD PIzza topic) for a few years to be close to theater, but moved back to Arizona because of lack of money.  It was another unsuccessful first date, not leading to a second date.  Overall, I recommend the pizza and the service was excellent."
4,"What a beautiful brunch oasis in downtown Phoenix.  Sitting outside on an April afternoon, listening to jazz and feeling the cool breeze (thanks to the misters), I felt like I was in the Mediterranean by the sea.  Or something like that.  Anyway, I really dug the atmosphere, and the food was delicious.  The Vegetarian Omelet was yummy, bursting with veggies, and the olives gave it a great flavor.  The potatoes were perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the whole wheat bread was thick and perfectly toasted.  I also had a few bites of the Banana Fosters French Toast, which is waaaaay too sweet, in my opinion, to be considered breakfast food but was a great finish to my meal.  The coffee is good enough to drink black."
4,"Agree with everyone on here, this is some really good food.  Very laid back un-asuming place inside another strip mall on Bell Road.  Ah what treasures lie hidden in a strip mall.... We were greeted by a friendly young man who took our order right away, I ordered, well I don't quite remember the name,  but it was steak pieces with french fries and onions, and rice.  I was fooled by the mild salsa that came with the chips and said, ""hey can you make my dish spicy?""  The server said no problem, and while the dish was very fresh, my mouth was on fire, and I touched  my eye and it was like pepper spray or something.  I love hot food, I can eat Los Dos Molinos Abogado ribs for example with little problem, but this stuff kicked my butt!!  It had little red peppers in it that I have never experienced before. HOT!!  I kept remembering Deb's review:""....this is not Mexican food...."".  No kidding, next time I will get it milder.  My eye burns still..... Wife got a milder flat pan steak dish with lentils and rice.  She praised its freshness.  We also split a red beef tamale (they were only like $2) so it was just a sample but decent. They only have 6 tables in there!  And they had to change their name due to copyright infringement from a restaurant  in Texas according to the young man.  Either way, we will be back for sure.  Good stuff!!  Something tells me there is more burn to come, perhaps tomorrow if you know what I mean?  Beware!  They can really spice it up if you ask them too.  I met my match at Mi Comida.... Fresh ingredients, nice people, and a nice change from Mexican food. Recommended!  Don't touch your eyes if you touched those little red pepper things, that is for sure!!"
5,"I went to the physical location the first time with my dog Foxy to scope out the place.  The store inside is iitttyyy bitttyyy and not worth going to in all honesty, but the staff that work there are REALLY friendly, and helpful.  Foxy eats Evanger's, which is really hard to find, and the only place I knew of that carried it was 20min away from me.       A month later, I run out of dog food....so I call Goober (after research I find they sell Evanger's for the cheapest price) and they delivered it right to me.  I wasn't home so they left it on my front porch along with a pretty large amount of free dog treats for Foxy !  They left their newsletter, some reference cards, and their product list (which is HUUUUGGGEEE) in a bag hanging from my door.  The reference cards you give out will earn you discounts on your next purchase!  Oh of course- I forgot to mention the delivery was completely FREE of charge!!!  I'll never get my dog food anywhere else."
5,"Ive been eating here more and more often lately, and I like the food.  If I want Mexican food, and I am in the downtown chandler area, this is where I stop in. The food quality is consistent.  Being a creature of habit, I get the same thing every time I come here. They are also serving cupcakes.  Looks like the change the flavor every once in a while too.  I have had a margarita flavored one, and a dark chocolate and chili one.  Tasty."
3,"Well the view is obvious.  I mean - it is decently high up and gives you a good view of downtown but, I don't know - the view from the Arizona Club is better.   We went here after watching a show at the Herberger and I was expecting some high class expensive dining that that is exactly what I got.  The service matched the price tag which was nice to see but the restaurant itself was disappointing.  Not only did they not have Coke or dark rum but they let poor Ashley A order a prime rib and then told her they were all out.   I had the drunken shrimp and they were pretty excellent.  The sauce around them was really good and they were resting on a piece of toast disguised as a crostini.  I also had a few bites of the lava cake but since it was buried under a pound of powered sugar, I couldn't eat any more. I guess I just agree with Beth S's review...I'm just not seeing what justifies the price.  The District in the Sheraton next door is a restaurant in a hotel that has amazing food that is priced better than this.  Plus, the view there isn't half bad."
4,The staff were very friendly and the place was clean and didn't smell funny like some other fast food joints.
4,"Went there for Dinner on a Friday night and I have to say I'm impressed by the quality of the food and the reasonable prices.  There's a great deal of variety and some creative New Mexican dishes.  I'd go so far as to say this is the best New Mexican restaurant in the East Valley!  Its not super spicy like Los Dos but there's a lot more flavor and you'll still feel the burn. Pro's:  The Food and Service Con's:  Ambiance & decor could use a little jazzing up, location is not ideal"
4,Love the medium wings and green salad with thousand island dressing!  The bartender CJ is da bomb!
4,I'm glad that Cafe Rio Mexican Grill opened up in Town and Country.  We have been to Cafe Rio a couple of times now.  On Tuesday they have tacos for $1.50.  Cafe Rio is now my favorite place for tacos.  The beef and pork tacos are the best.  If you are looking for a good taco you should check out Cafe Rio.
5,"I love this place. The food is clearly made with love and the folks there are so inviting and warm.  Great vibe. Great food. Great price. You can bet the next time I visit Phoenix, I'll be coming back to Tiny's ;)"
4,"Great service.  Tasty food.  I like it for lunch because later, I can skip dinner.  Their salad bar satisfies the vegetarian taste buds.  I like this place alot.  I think it lives up to the hype."
5,"The best fish tacos, period!  And I hate chain restaurants!"
5,"This location is quieter than the one at Arizona Mills Mall. No screaming kids in your way. The clothes are less disheveled, still attached to the hanger, but for the same low price. I get my husband's work shirts here for like $8. Ross understands that there are still skinny Americans out there and they carry size 4 pants. YESSSSS! I -3 the unusual house goods you can find at Ross. I redid my whole bathroom and made it into a nice Victorian style in light pink and a wood brown. They had this soft-green painted shelf that looked like a twisted vine. Where else can you find something like that? I found these two toothbrush cups that were painted with butterflies. Worth the $5 each. My bathroom is gorgeous. You'll want to take a crap in there."
4,Great food. Service consistently blows. Sit at the bar and you will be fine.
5,"Awesome place. I am pretty sure that this is my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale.  Honeycomb, radishes, and a huge heap of rainbow valley butter for an appetizer? what?! Whaat? I had to take a picture of it. The waitress gave me a hard time about this, but she was cool :p My coworkers and I went on a mission to try everything here. I do remember the brussel sprouts being too salty. but everything else was great. spicy broccoli... fat-fat cooked potatoes.... perfectly grilled ribeeyeeeee.. .yummm.. but i dooo remember the brussel sprouts being a bit too salty for me.. but i forgave them for this.  In addition to the great food, it's a cute little restaurant with a lot of character. The servers (who are also your bartenders - i thought this was a bit interesting) are really friendly.  Good memories here!"
4,"My husband surprised me with a stay-cation at the Westin Resort for the weekend and we ate here on our first night! Let me just say, I LOVE MUDDLED DRINKS, I am not a fan of cosmos or martini's or anything that just tastes like strong alcohol - BLAH! For me stronger isn't better, flavor and uniqueness is better! This place has by far the best muddled drinks I have ever had! If you just want to go for drinks they have this cute little drink bar right before you enter the restaurant - separate from the main dining which I thought was nice. The decor is romantic latin! I love it!  We started our dinner first by receiving these potato rolls. OMG where have these been my entire life!!!!???!! They are just fall apart in your mouth good! We both ordered mambo mango drinks - STELLAR! We then got the tres ceviches (lobster escabeche / mixto clasico / ruby red tuna) the lobster was the best! But all very good. However the crab empanada was my favorite! YUM! My husband got the jidori chicken and myself the adobo pork. Both were good but not GREAT. Too much seasoning on my pork. To me this place is a MUST go to for drinks and small bites. I would have given this place five stars but the entrees just didn't do it for us. However, it was not horrible - just okay. The rest of our experience with dinner - service, restaurant ambiance, overall feel and all of our food and drinks before the entrees was AMAZING! So we will be back just for a more small bites and drink night!"
4,"Good tattoo shop. Clean space, multiple artists to choose from and books of their work are available for you to look though and decide who's style most mirrors what you're looking for. I chose Jet to do a cover-up for me and he worked with me on the design and our ideas and communication flowed very well. He's a very personable guy, is friendly and keeps the conversation going while he's working on you, and he doesn't dick around (read: He starts to work and continues until the job is done). He's very professional and informative. Good customer service combines with talent at the craft."
3,"I have been wanting to eat here since it opened and finally got the opportunity.  The ambiance and service is excellent, however that was not the reason why I was there.  I was there for the food that a lot of people have been raving about. I read somewhere that the hanger steak was their specialty and I don't disagree.  I had a taste and it was indeed very tasty.  And if I go back I will definitely get it.  And at under $20 it is a steal.  However, I ordered the 8oz filet for myself.  It was cooked properly and tasted good but not memorable.  The individual sauces that you can order on the side were also nothing special.  And yes, the fries were just as everyone on Yelp said they were; good but just like In-n-Out's, but cooked a bit longer.  The sides dishes were ok at best and were a bit on the smaller side.  However, the potato gratin was amazing and better than I have had at any steak place thus far. While it is less expensive than Mastros/City Hall, I think that for a few extra dollars it is worth going to a better place.  In my opinion, Mastros/City Hall have much better steaks and better/bigger side dishes.  However, J & G does have a better ambiance."
3,"Yelper Jane B's review is remarkably similar to what I intended to include in my review. We've stayed at close to a dozen different Homewood Suites over the years and this one left us wishing we could have stayed at any of the others instead. Furnishings were adequate but not terribly comfortable.  The living room had a sleeper sofa and a side chair, a dining table with two chairs, an end table, a coffee table, and a TV stand with 3 drawers plus the kitchenette, all in a room roughly 9' x 14'. The bedroom contained a desk with 3 drawers (serving also as the dresser) and the bed and nightstands.  The desk also served as the TV stand, allowing a small work area and taking up so much room the door couldn't swing all the way open. Our bedroom also contained the mystery deadbolted closet with unknown contents, which took up half the guest closet space. The bathroom was large but dingy and dimly lit. I considered renting an on-demand movie one evening, but everything offered by the hotel was $15+/each (!!) and since there wasn't a DVD player we didn't have the opportunity to rent somewhere more reasonable and bring it back to our room.  Free wifi seemed stable although a bit slow, and the pool was small but the kids didn't seem to mind. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was well-prepared and always had enough variety to keep the kids and adults happy. We got a great rate but hey, it's Scottsdale in the summer so most rates are pretty darn good.  Normally we enjoy staying away from home, but after 6 nights here even the kids were anxious to get home. We'll stay at Homewood Suites again in the future, but not this one."
1,"Our bartender was rude and impersonal, to start. When my wife ordered a diet coke, you could see her disdain. We saw her once more, when she took our food order, after which she sat in the corner and ate. The remaining staff dropped off our food without a word, and never came back; in fact, I had to flag down the manager to get cashed out. The food was sub par. My wife's Shepard pie was all mashed potatoes, and my chicken strips were incorrect and with the wrong side. Also, my fries were soggy because they had been placed over excess sauce.  Poor food, awful service, overpriced beer. Visit the Kyrene location or don't go at all."
4,"Both of the previous reviewers are correct, actually. Yes, there can be a line to the door at times, and not everyone working there is 100% nice 100% of the time. But who is? And, once you get to know them -- and are courageous enough to give them the benefit of the doubt -- everyone working there is very cool to deal with. Because this Post Office is tucked way back in the Foothills, it's not staffed as heavily as I've seen some others. But the remoteness of the location also means you get to breeze in and out on rare occasions too (seeing as this is too far out of the way for any non-Foothills residents). So, do like me: never go here in a hurry; be polite; be patient (it's not all about you). And you'll see this is really no worse than any other Post Office...and maybe even a little bit better."
4,"I never used to like Chipotle - pretty much the same way I never used to like gyro's, but now I can't get enough! I don't go for the overstuffed burritos - the cleaner and easier to eat burrito bowl is the way to go.  I always get double steak, rice, pinto beans, and the medium tomatillo salsa - best...combo...ever!  I guess I should branch out and try new things on the menu, but I ALWAYS order the same thing from every place I frequent.  Ok - next time I'll try something other than the chicken - since it's super bland. The staff are always super helpful - even got a little tip from the cashier once.  If the line is long (as it always is), just step outside, place a phone order, then hop around the line to go pick up your called in order, because she said they make it nearly immediately. ahahah  I've made an order with my iPhone twice now, and it couldn't be easier. The only reason this place got 4 stars was because even though the steak is awesome most of the time, from time to time it's kinda tough - it could be that much better if the meat was a little bit better quality.  Also - the chicken is always dry and lacks flavor."
4,"So it was my second time when I actually enjoyed what I was eating because we actually knew what we were ordering.  And the broth was a lot better than the first time.  The first my friends and I ate at Tien Wong, we had ordered the Ying-Yang pot, which had the spicy and mild on each side, it was okay.  This time, we ordered the Lemon Grass one. Which I highly recommend!!! It was so much better than the Ying-Yang.   NEVER NEVER NEVER get the quail eggs.  It was a waste of money.  and make sure to get lots and lots of beef slices.  That's like my favorite part of eating hot pot.  I like eating the clear Asian noodles one the most...it doesn't make the broth all thick after putting the noodles intot he broth like the udon noodles.   I also really like the fact that they're open really late.  Midnight snack!!"
5,"Wow!  This place completely rocks!  Very professional, courteous, and very good at what they do - make cars clean again.  The price was very reasonable and I will be back again many times over!  Thank you, Stewart Detailing!  Job well done."
3,"The Good:  -Virtually any sport you want to watch, they'll have it on one of their many TVs for you.   -Strong drinks, made correctly. Their bartenders are great. -The staff is very friendly and usually quite attentive. -Patio seating is plentiful, along with a firepit for the winter and misters for the summer. -Bouncers at the door know their stuff and will take out a crazy drunk before you even have to ask. The Bad:  -The food really isn't very good. Most of it is run-of-the-mill bar food that came out of a package and tastes like crayons (bland and boring). Their garlic fries and cheese sticks are delicious though. -It can get very crowded on big game nights, and as such service can get very slow or the servers may even not be told you've been seated (the hostesses aren't great). -Sometimes at night they play the music ridiculously loud - it's a bar, not a dance club. No one goes there to sit and not hear their company. Go There For: A sports game with your friends to drink. Don't Go There For: A hearty meal with grandma after church on Sunday."
4,"Whenever I go here, it is packed - and for a good reason, the yogurt they offer is delicious - and they have a great variety of flavors and toppings. I love the self-serve concept, but be careful not to fill up your cup too much - it's a bit pricey and they charge in weight. (They only offer a one size cup that is huge - so if you fill it up with toppings you're likely to spend close to $10 for a cup of yogurt!)"
5,"When I was a dancer I always came here for everything. Shoes, leotards, skirts, and accessories. They have every type of dance shoe and a wide variety of everything dancers need and want.  I'm not sure how many dance shops are in the area, but all of my instructors always recommended this place which is not very close to our studio. The staff is all very kind and knowledgeable which trust me is a very good thing. Dance shoes can get confusing! There are at least three different kind of tap shoes!  Dee's also has costume rentals so if you ever need a crazy costume at the last minute Dee's can help you out with that too!"
5,"The quintessential Brewery with a wholly fantastic kitchen. Best spinach artichoke dip in the valley, period. From fried to gourmet Four Peaks has it all. Beerbread sandwiches are always excellent, fish and chips, bavarian pretzels, french fries, daily specials, I really haven't had an item that I didn't like! The weather is perfect right now for a sunny patio lunch or fresh air dinner.  Let's not forget the beer. My favorites are the Oatmeal Stout or the Peach. Their peach beer is legendary with low sweetness and a crisp refreshing taste. If you think cider is too sweet but like fruity flavor, this is your beer. The oatmeal stout is thick and hearty with no bitterness. Seasonal beers abound, pumpkin porter in the fall, I've seen an orange blossom, belgian white, barleywine, etc. Parking close can be a challenge on weekend nights, best to ride your bike if you're close enough.  http://www.fourpeaks.com for a complete menu. Just go there already!"
4,Worked around the corner for about a year anticipating this place opening. Finally got to stop in for coffee this morning (a year later) and had a piping hot Americano and a mango-poppyseed muffin. Big fan so far! Looking forward to having coffee on the patio when it's a bit cooler.
5,"Excellent wings. I realized how much I miss this place when I ate horrible chicken wings in San Jose.  It gets crowded Tuesday and Thursday because of special deal on wings, but definetly worth it.  They do not have any Native NewYorker in CA :("
2,"This place is not that great. Shogun express has way better chicken teriyaki rice bowls and beyond. The chicken is what really bothered me here. It was really tough and extremely chewy. And that was the white meat. They're bowls are around 5 bucks which I like, but they're not even filled to the top.  All in all I came here because Shogun was closed and there aren't any other rice bowl places in Scottsdale that I know of. Eh."
4,"We eat dinner here often, usually with exemplary service and delicious food.  If you get seated in Tanya's section, ask to be moved immediately!  She was nice, but a terrible waitress."
3,"A nice place to shop, but I wouldn't want to live there.  I never used to be a department store shopper, but recently Ive discovered that nicer cloths just seem to fit better. Go figure. While I still like getting a deal, I usually wait until there is a clearance or sale or some type. The macy's at scottsdale fashion square seems to have more selection, such as more size options for the items you seem to like and a few more items to choose from also. For guys, I would suggest checking out the Dillards at fashion square; the mens dept is about the size of this entire macy's store. 2 or 3 times a year dillards has an awesome clearance event and you can pickup 65% off clearance prices; which are usually already 50 - 70% off the original price. I digress; this is supposed to be a review of macy's. If you're in the biltmore area and looking for higher end quality shopping go ahead and check them out, then travel down camelback to fashion square mall when they tell you the item you like is only available in your size at a different store."
4,"This little place is great, the service, the tacos, the guac, and the prices!"
1,"I have been here once for lunch and sat outside only to get eaten alive by flies, nothing worse than eating outside on a nice patio and being pestered the entire time.  I decided to give it another chance for happy hour, well guess what? flies followed me inside too.  I don't know if it was the time of year (early spring) or what, but they really need an exterminator!"
4,"VOODOO Chicken was fantastic!  Most of the entree selections were available over rice or pasta.  They had many gluten free options and they use brown rice and brown pasta. I stumbled upon Jaspers Peak Bistro on accident and I am glad I did.  Cajun inspired food cooked well.  Very satisfying and delicious. The server was a bit neglectful, but we were loving our food so much and the company of friends that we didn't mind so much.  The neglectful server did recommend the food we ordered and we were very happy with it."
5,Of course it gets hot in the summer. You're going to be watching bands in a basement with a bunch of people and depending on when / what's going on there might be some idiots 'mawshing'.  Sound quality is great for the size. Glad they reopened one of my favorite venues. and YES everybody has gotten lost the first time they tried to find the Nile. The main & front room have shows as well.
2,The price is a little high for me.  They don't give enough bean sprouts without asking for more.  The pho broth is a little too sweet for me also
4,I really enjoy this place and have eaten there several times. They just recently changed their menu but I like the brew additions. The coconut shrimp are awesome and the ahi tuna salad is to for for!  I did have the chimichurri flank steak sliders but they weren't good. Our waitress was great and offered me something else.
4,We visited last week.  The lady offered us a lot of samples of their food so we could pick out what we liked.  The food was excellent and the service was great.  The restaurant was very kid friendly.
5,"this place rules, plain and simple just wish they had a cheaper jukebox"
5,"I've been going to La Canasta for as long as I can recall. I live in Tempe and can't go as often as I'd  like but I go at least once a month. I love this Canasta because they have a green chile salsa and menudo every day! Always quick and fresh. I either get the ground beef tacos (yummy), the red chile burrito (watch out), or the menudo (got a hangover?). It is very consistent and prices, well it adds up, but it is worth it. I have yet to have a bad experience after 28 years!"
2,"i am so disappointed with this place. they consistently do a half a--ed job. after many disappointing visits i decided no more wasting money on crappy car washes from there. alas, i ended up with a free car wash (fill up your gas tank 9 times, get a free wash!) so i gave them another chance. upgraded it to the vip (the ""best"") wash for $8 more. also had the floor mats shampooed at $1 each. the floor mats were filthy when the car went in and spotless when they were replaced in the car - what a bargain! if only the rest of the car turned out the same.  when returned to me a good 40-45 minutes later, the inside of my little car was still quite dirty, a good amount of dog hair remained, and the center area where the cupholders, change tray and gear shifter are weren't wiped down. let me tell you, there was definitely reason to clean those areas. danny's started the job, but never finished, and lucky me! i got to spend more time on sunday to complete cleaning my car. i paid $12, but should have paid $22. at either price this remains a very poor value."
4,"I have only been to this theater once.  I was hanging out with some girlfriends and this is the closest theater to where they live.  At first glance, it looks like a typical movie theater.  For the most part it is.  The thing that I found awesome, was that it has a daycare center.  If a couple wants to go to a movie and it's not appropriate for the child or they just want to do something for the two of them, they can bring their little one to the day care center.  I can't believe all the parents, who bring their kids to adult movies.  It's unacceptable and of course selfish of the parents.  I hope other theaters catch on to this.   It's also right next to Buffalo Wild Wings and several shops and other restaurants in the area.  Check it out."
5,"Lolo's is one of my favorite places to eat in the valley.  Their dining room is very small and sometimes there's a long wait at the door but their staff is always super friendly and there for you if you need anything. Things I've tried there: LoLo's special which is 3 piece of chicken with 2 waffles, Stupid fries, side of potatoes smothered, Chyna's honey hots (which are their hotwings), Ivan's chorizo and eggs, and their banana cream pudding. Their chicken is perfectly cooked.  Nice, crunchy, juicy, and very flavorful.  Their waffles are fantastic as well, but my all time favorite has got to be their Stupid Fries.  It's a basket of freshly cooked french fries smothered in gravy with bits of bell peppers, onions, and chunks of their fried chicken.  I have no idea how they do it but even though their fries are smothered, it stays extra crispy under all that sauce.  That's what makes it so darn delicious.  It's definitely a meal in itself.  Their banana cream pudding is so large you guys can share it.  Banana cream anything is one of my favorites so of course I would say that it was amazing!! Their koolaide are awesome as well.  You can't come here and not have their koolaide.  I love their blue but I sometime switch it up to red.  My fiance and I have tried their Scottsdale location as well but I feel that the cook at the Phoenix location (which is the original) has got it down packed.  My food always arrive and taste just as good as the last time as to their Scottsdale location, the food doesn't taste the same to me.  Maybe I'm just trippin' but that's how I feel.   Overall, this place is pretty awesome.  I can't wait for them to finish their expansion."
4,"had the place to ourselves on a thurs nite (5/19) so...service great, mgr came over and asked if we had eaten here before ""nope"" so he said he wanted to buy dessert, ""great, thank you"" oreo cheesecake was good... now.... pizza...pricey by 2-4 bucks but was very good. can't go wrong with your toppings but the riccotta was not my cup of tea (wife liked it on her pizza). definetly going back to try it again... great crust"
2,"I love German food, and as far as the food went at Bavarian Point, they had some good eats. The *only* reason I'm giving the restaurant two stars instead of one is the food. Their rindsroulade was very good, and the red cabbage and spaetzle were excellent. But the quality of the food was undercut by the poor service. It was bad enough that I wouldn't return, and certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. As others have noted, there was no-one to greet or seat us -- not even a sign saying ""seat yourself"". Our waitress took a LONG time to make it to our table to take our drink orders, and when she did, she was complaining about something and looked put-out in general. When my wife ordered a beer, the waitress told her that it would be more expensive because it wasn't available on tap. Now, that could be useful information, but the manner in which she told my wife was defiant rather than helpful. Believe me, we gave her no reason to be so sour --  it was clear that this particular waitress was clearly unhappy -- whether with her job or life, it's hard to say. It's too bad, really, because the food *was* good. But why would anyone want to eat at a restaurant whose workers are either nowhere to be found, or miserable? Not me."
4,4.5 Stars The seafood tower was amazing and my ribeye was very good.  Very expensive.  Much better experience than the ocean club in Newport Beach.
4,"I have been to the particular location many times.  Except for the wait, we have always had a good experience. I just love that deep dish pizza. I am sure it is on slice away from stopping my heart, but not here for the health food."
4,"Nice people, great food.  A really nice white linen place.  Loved the chicken karachi, naan, samosas, chicken pakora.  Wife had a lovely red, I had a nice premium margarita."
3,"Their salad bar here is lacking. I used to go to Whole Foods when I was too lazy to make anything to eat, but didn't want to be riddled with guilt about eating out.  The people who work here are friendly and they have a huge selection of canned veggies for salads, as well as other specialty items that may be harder to find out here. They also carry the largest selection of Amy's Organic frozen foods that I adore. mmmmm tofu pockets..."
4,"There is absolutely no other restaurant in town that has better BBq.  Their pull pork is just mouth watering.. Very juicy.. Great bbq sauce with a touch of spicy to it... Just perfect.. Ribs are unbelievable.. This is not a place you get a 5 star customer service.. if you are going here and expecting anything but great bbq, you will disappointed... It's a whole in wall and I absolutely love their food... I usually give a lot of points for customer service and treatment... but their food is so good that makes up for everything else they lack and I will keep going back just because of their good bbq...."
4,"Phoenix has some absolutely amazing Italian pizza joints. And when I'm in the mood to spend some extra money and wait a while I go to them. But man alive! Red Devil is pretty close in terms of quality and it's a lot more laid back. During our last visit, we sat in back. The space has several nice little tucked away areas so everywhere has a nice private feel. Our waitress was really nice and accomodating and was with us in just over a minute. Some of the fancier drinks were recommended, but we were content with just plain old lemonade. Just the right balance of sweet and tangy. The bruschetta arrived quickly fresh out of the oven. The oil and tomatoes were spilling over the top and had a very rich flavor. The Italian pizza was just right temperature wise and the green olives added a nice salty kick to the sausage. The prices are reasonable. The staff is great and the pizza is delicious.  Plus we met a 6 year old in the parking lot who claimed to be a princess. How great is that?"
4,"These guys scare me. We set up a repair with Karen for a noise in the dash area which i said seemed to coincide with the gauge movement at start-up. Well, we came back the next day and found we had a new stereo but the noise was louder. The dash was pulled and it was determined to be the A/C door actuators and Karen set an appt. for drop-off and rental car pick-up the following day. On the way down the A/C quit working completely. Angie called me the next morning to let me know we could pick up our one day rental as they replace the condensor. Nothing was said about the noise which we brought it in for originally and, more to the point, no knowledge of this at all was logged into their system regarding why we dropped it off the night before. We had already been set up in a rental car by Karen the day before but for some reason nobody had a clue what was going on and she and the technician had both gone on vacation. Finally after speaking with the service manager, Gary, and explaining to them what should have been in the notes on my car it was determined they would handle everything and we could keep the rental on their dime. This made me feel better and we picked up our car 2 days later with functioning A/C. On the way home from the dealership the A/C quit working again so back it went for another random repair. Tuesday came and we picked it up again after they had to make some A/C computer module fix but... on the way home from Coulter... my wife noticed the ABS and Traction Control lights were flashing red and indicating they were innoperative. So now the car was unsafe to drive but at least we had A/C to keep us cool if we had a wreck from the new issue. We took it back to night drop-off since they were now closed and this morning, Wednesday, they have it back in the shop to see what happened as they were doing the other work. I'm so happy I don't own the warranty company since I'm sure they are paying for all of these mistakes.  Hmmm... Update to follow - Noon 8/29 update - Our new service person, Ben, called and as it turns out this is totally unrelated to the A/C issue but is instead, the brake pedal sensor, whatever that is. It's ready to come home. I'm beginning to think that the consumer reports review on this GMC Acadia is accurate. 40K+ for a good looking, nice handling, unreliable SUV.   Overall I have to say that once Gary and Ben were involved this has taken a turn for the better and maybe all this confusion was just a fluke. I'll give them another chance next time we have a service issue."
5,"What an awesome sushi place! I highly recommend How do You roll, if you want some sushi done quickly and freshly and without wait. what a novel idea. I want to thank the manager Amanda for taking good care of me, can't wait to come back again!"
1,"So, not following my own advice (ahem, NEVER RETURN), I returned here for a friend's birthday dinner a few months ago (I super love this person so how could I say no?). HA! Big mistake. Also, fair warning: there are several-a-CAPS-LOCK ahead. The only pleasant thing about the evening was the reservation and seating were right on time for our large group (15 people). And of course because we were celebrating a super special person. I'll keep this update short and sweet: $3 for a CAN OF SODA? Get real. I knew it'd be overpriced but I was at least expecting a mini bottle or something. But a can? COME ON. You bought that in bulk and paid .03342 cents for it. FAIL. Your servers: IDIOTS. First it takes our server 15 minutes to come around the first time and take drink orders. Then she's back another 15 minutes after that taking the orders again. Did you forget? Were you not paying attention the first time we around? Why did it take 30 minutes just to order drinks? And on top of that we wait another 15 to receive them. FORTY-FIVE MINUTES TO RECEIVE DRINKS IS BAD. Very, very bad.  Also, not taking food orders until after we've been seated for ONE HOUR is BAD. VERY, VERY BAD. Seated at 8 o'clock, we didn't receive our food until almost TEN O'CLOCK. TWO HOURS FOR FOOD IS VERY, VERY BAD. Do you hear that, St. Francis? BAD. Because I loathed the place even before this lovely birthday dinner, and because the thought of supporting such an establishment makes my blood boil, I ordered only dessert and the hubs ordered an appetizer (and add on a $3 can soda). Funny, that our bill was still nearly $30 for the both of us. Excluding tip. BAD. Also, server: If you say you're not going to split a check, stick to your word or don't even try. Now, I'M glad you didn't stick to your stingy ""I don't split checks"", because I could foresee the mess of trying to split a $700 bill with 13 people I didn't know so well. Lucky for us, when we told you we were leaving early and asked for our check, you split it for us. A couple others caught on and did the same, but the remaining 7-8 people were not so lucky.  Because I realize my short and sweet is not so short anymore (or sweet, for that matter), I'm ending it here. NOTE TO SELF: heed own advice and stay away from St. Francis!"
4,"Had a team dinner here 2 weeks ago. The food was decent and since it's the closest Thai restaurant to me, very convenient.  Appetizers: Angel wings-- fried chicken drumsticks stuffed with noodles and spices. Fried tofu -- just exactly like it sounds, crispy fried tofu served with a sweet fish sauce dip. Tom kha soup-- spicy lemongrass broth with mushrooms, chicken, and carrots.  Mains: eggplant dish with chicken-- okay, served with a basic brown sauce. Pad thai-- too sweet and saucy for my taste. Panang curry-- I enjoyed this but we ordered this with chicken and I personally think it tastes better with beef."
5,"Baiz Market is a ""Mediterranean"" type restaurant, or ""Arabic"" type food. Well, you could get confused and call it that. The fact of the matter is though, that this place has a very unique touch. This restaurant is a staple not only for groceries, but also its food. The owner is persian, so you can tell where the tastes are coming from. Its somewhat hidden in the heart of Phoenix, but that's ok, once you are there you will be glad you found it. This place is unique because they make their own bread! Are you kidding me? I only recently found out about this place like 3 years ago, and I've been living in Phoenix for 20 years. The chicken and beef shawarma have a special, authentic taste because of the fresh bread. One of the best parts about the shawarma is not only its amazing taste, but the pricing is very fair as well. I don't think I can stress this enough, but the fresh bread just sets this place apart from all the impostors in the Phoenix metro area. Why haven't the other restaurants caught on? I know of maybe one persian restaurant that makes their own bread, but their pricing makes them a different story (I'm talking about 'The Persian Room' in Scottsdale). I just don't understand how other restaurants can serve the bread that comes in plastic bags from a manufacturer hundreds of miles away. 'Good bread' and 'Arabic bread' are all good forms of pita that have great shelf life due to the ridiculous amounts of preservatives, but they just don't taste fresh. If you like the bread, head to the back of the store and there is a shelf of freshly baked pita bread, its baked throughout the day, I think. I can tell because sometimes my bread is still warm and the bag has a little condensation. Beware though, the bread gets hard and crunchy after a few days, so you really need to use it quickly. This isn't bad, its just I think they choose not to add preservatives to ensure the freshness of the pita. I usually just get the chicken or beef shawarma, but I decided I'd get a kabob plate one day because I also wanted hummus. The beef kabob plate came with hummus, bread, 2 skewers of beef kabob, and some pickles and onions. Wow. The beef kabobs were cooked perfectly, and were EXTREMELY tender. It was a tad bit on the lemony side, but I suppose that was necessary to make it so tender. Perhaps some of the best 'persian kabobs' I have ever had. The hummus was definitely good as well, I can't stand restaurants that crack open a can of premade hummus. This restaurant certainly did not disappoint with the hummus. I know friends in Tucson that make stops specifically at this place for shawarma, and rightly so. If you're weary of persian food, just check this place out. Its not expensive at all, food for two is like $15. The wide variety of ethnic foods is also interesting."
4,"I took my 6-year-old son here for his first taste of frozen yogurt.  There is only one size of cup to choose from, and that is a little inconvenient.  You have to make sure you don't fill it to the top.  I had chocolate, and my son had a mix of cake batter, red velvet cake batter, and oreo.  They were all good.  In addition to those flavors, they had vanilla, tart, butterfinger, pomegranate, and a couple others I can't quite remember.  There were a lot of toppings to choose from.  Chocolate chip cookies, cut up moon pie, dark chocolate, white chocolate, and milk chocolate chips, karob chips, sugar free chocolate pieces, mochi, colored mochi, every crushed up candy bar you can imagine, lots of fruits, 4-5 different syrups, gummy bears, gummy worms, sour gummy twizzlers, gigantic marshmallows, and whipped cream.  There were many more things, but I can't quite remember them all.  It was the largest selection I've seen, but I'm pretty new to AZ and haven't had experience with that many frozen yogurt shops.  The employees were really helpful.  Everything was spotlessly clean, and the yogurt was really great.  We will be back."
4,"For a taste of the exotic, the allure of eating without utensils, and a journey to Ethiopia...Lalibela is your dining destination.   Although this cozy restaurant is located in a strip mall in Tempe, the African art, woven baskets, and boxes of Harar in the hall (Ehtiopian Lager, which is delicious!) give you a small sense that you have stepped into another world. This illusion stays well preserved as you peruse the menu and realize you have never seen anything like it, starting with your inability to pronounce ""Yekik Alicha"" (split peas). But do not be daunted by this new territory.  Start your adventure to Ethiopia with the ""Yekemem Shai,"" a black tea with cinnamon, cardamom & cloves.  If you are new to Ethiopian, and not sure what to get, the Lalibela Exclusive is the most fantastic combination of dishes you can sample.  Here, you will have a smattering of meat and vegetarian dishes ranging from ""Yebeg Alicha Sega Wat"" (lamb cubes simmered in kibae, onion, turmeric and herbs) to my personal fave, the ""Yekik Alicha"" (split peas cooked with onion, turmeric and herbs). Once the food arrives, the basket of ""injera"" (bread closely resembling a crepe) will become your eating utensils.  Don't be shy, tear off a piece, and use it to scoop the delicious morsels off the plate and into your expectant mouth.  You will not be disappointed.  In fact, you may feel as though you have just stepped off University and into a traveling caravan in the Ethiopian desert. Whether you are a carniverous adventurer, or a vegetarian swashbuckler - you will enjoy the richness and flavors of this unique cuisine. Bring a large appetite, as the food is quite filling.  Dominant meats are beef, chicken and lamb.  Savory veggies to be enjoyed are lentils, peas, cabbages, and collard greens. For a lovely gustative to finish your meal, order a glass of the traditional Ethiopian sweet wine made from honey. Overall, from the service to the food, to the ambiance, an excellent place to bring friends, or a date ;)"
3,"Service was good, however my fettucine alfredo with meatballs was just OK. I would pass on this menu item the next and try something different."
4,"This is a fun POOL party club in Scottsdale next to everyone's favorite, American Junkie. I have never eaten here, other than a dessert that I don't remember. ;) It can also be a fun place for after dinner drinks or dance. The ambiance of relaxing and drinking next to a pool always brings about a good time. The music is LOUD and the bartenders are nice. Their bathrooms are clean and pretty.  Spanish Fly rages during the daytime summer weekends, and is a great place to hang out when you still want to enjoy the outdoors and it's blazing hot outside. I will be going back - glad to have you in Scottsdale, Spanish Fly."
4,"Yume Sushi Grill is a great spot! All of the sushi is very fresh, and they pride themselves in having great quality. The sushi chefs are knowledgeable in their craft, and also extremely friendly to have a chat with. They serve free salad and miso soup, and the serving staff is friendly, helpful, and attentive. The Korean dishes are pretty authentic, and the home made kimchi is great! I recommend the bulgogi, bi bim bab, and spicy pork for meals. Lunch time is the best time to go, as their lunch specials are amazingly priced for the amount of food that you receive.  The one complaint that I have is that they don't stock a few of my favorite kinds of sushi (although I know they aren't the most popular) mackerel, quail eggs, and surf clam won't be found on the menu."
5,"I just went here for the first time a week ago (visiting my parents who just moved to FH). A++ Great location, view of the fountain, outside seating, nice decor inside, really wonderful owner and a big menu of pastries, croissant, sandwiches, Italian sodas, and coffee. I had the egg salad sandwich (the croissant and egg salad was SO FRESH!!) with a side of potato salad was probably one of the top 3 potato salads I've ever had! I also got an iced mocha which was just the way I like it, on the sweet side. I had my 14 month old daughter with me so I also shared the potato salad with her and ordered a yogurt with granola.  This was no ordinary McDonalds yogurt parfait - it was so delicious I had to have some too! One gripe (that could be easily fixed by the owner) - PLEASE BUY ONE HIGHCHAIR for your guests to use.  We would love to come back often (as we go see grandma/grandpa) but I can't take another lunch with her on my lap:)"
4,The food is always awesome.  Best in the area.    The people behind the counter need to pull their heads out of their asses.  Don't be rude to me if I ask for an extra bag to carry my food.  I'd be happy to let the food drop to the floor for you to clean up.
2,"As far as teppanyaki restaurants go this one isn't top of my favorites. 2 stars for good service and a nice setting... I'm docking 3 stars for my food being over cooked and not being offered anything to replace it, and our chef not doing any sort of classic teppanyaki cooking tricks (making oil light on fire, flipping shrip at people, bouncing his utensils around.. ect). Decent place to eat, but not a value for what you pay for."
5,"I am a big fan of this place, either to stop in on a slow Sunday just to see what they have.  Their stock rotates pretty frquently so always new interesting things to find.  So far I've bought a vintage print, an awesome dress that I have received tons of compliments on, cool earrings, and some other kitchen items.  The staff are always friendly.  When you go, make sure you check out the Burt Reynolds beefcake poster they have behind the counter. Great strore!"
4,"Great service !!! Food was good, not spectacular, but very good. They had some crative rolls and a few really good appetizers. Cool little spot that kinda hides in a non descript spot , I will certainly be back if I get a chance before leaving town"
5,"Wedge salad is delish! Love the fact that it's organic, as well as the fact that the pizza dough is gluten-free...sure beats having my husband sneeze for an hour, after eating ""regular"" pizza. I will say, the pizza is pretty good...and this is coming from a girl from Chicago!"
3,"I was NOT too impressed with this place but...  it was good for Phoenix, where I am starting to realize there is NOT an abundance of people who look like me.  =/   LOL!  Flavor-wise I thought it was pretty good.  Don't be misled by the spring rolls...  Even though it says they serve them in 3s...  its 3 that are cut in half...  so you get 6 pieces.  This is pretty good if you're looking to share with someone.  I did not get a lot of lettuce and mint, though and ate the last two pieces by themselves.  I was a little disappointed by this. I had the combination Pho...  (YES i braved SOUP it in HOT ASS ARIZONA) and it was not too bad either.  The broth was nice and clear, just portion wise...  was not as extra large as I expected it to be. When the bill came, I ended up paying about $18 total which included tax and tip and no drink.  I think the Pho was almost $10.00 and the Spring Rolls were like $4 and some change? I think this place is cool but would not be my FIRST choice when it comes to pho.  (Trust me...  I've eaten a LOT of pho)  I just don;t think the price vs. portion is worth what you;re paying.  This saddens me to say too because, I am ALL about supporting small Asian businesses.   Oh well..."
2,"Place was great the first time I went, Second time one of Dan's fair weather buddies (thinking he was big shooter) disrespected a good friend of mine over a misunderstanding that could have easily been solved through civil conversation, but he tried to be Mr. Big Shot.   The food was good, but not good enough to put up with that crap ever again."
4,"Chick has the potential to be a restaurant we want to keep coming back to.  The food will keep us trying for an exceptional experience, but some things needs to be fixed if Chick is to see it's first anniversary. 1.)  The space:  Cute slightly upper scale boutique ""farmhouse"".  Decor and lighting is warm yet modern.  The only miss: The beautiful tables.  They are heavily distressed with very deep grooves as if made from reclaimed wood.  There can't possibly be any way for them to clean the tables thoroughly - The thought of a small portion of everyone's food that has dined here before me staring at me -- especially as time goes on and those grooves fill up with food & germs grosses me out.  A piece of glass on each table is a definite food safety must.  To make matters worse, tables are set with your silverware on the bare table.  Silverware should never be placed on anything other than a fresh a napkin or table cloth.   2.)  The menu:  The menu they offer is a little different from your average restaurant which can make for a memorable experience.  However, putting a menu like theirs in a small but thick leather bound binder with just a couple items per page made us feel like unwelcome outsiders.  The incessant flipping between pages with types of entrees and sides and sauces was quite frustrating.  I recommend picking up the takeout menu at the front door and using that to navigate the menu. 3.)  The service: Awkward but very friendly.  Our waiter seemed like a foodie fit for a restaurant like this, but his table presence left us feeling like we needed to make *him* comfortable talking to us or requesting anything.  I had to fight most of the meal to have more than 3-4 ice cubes in my iced tea.  After asking a couple members of the staff for a glass of ice, they kept bringing back my glass with just more tea and no more ice. At one point, the server brought my iced tea glass back without a straw.  When I asked for one, his reply was ""can you use the one from your water glass for now?"" 4.)  The food:  This is what made up for most of the other shortcomings especially because Chick is still new.  I had the country pork with creamed corn and mashed potato ""bar"".  You get 3 toppings with the mashed potato which the chefs will assemble for you.  I chose mesquite sour cream, applewood smoked bacon, and Vermont white cheddar - Delicious!  The creamed corn was very tasty as well.  The mandarin orange chutney paired amazingly well with the pork. My husband had the chicken and dumplings.  It's a little different from the traditional C&D, but was very good.  It's served in a lighter broth instead of a heavy sauce which was a welcome change. We decided next time the hubby and I go, we would take our chances at the bar and avoid the servers until they can get caught up on their service skills."
4,"After long debate of where to have lunch, I am glad that I stopped into The Greek Pita.   I had ordered the lamb gyro with everything except onions.  The gyro was loaded with lamb meat and toppings.  The pita was soft and fresh. The Tzatziki sauce  has a nice tang to it.  It tasted light, cool, and creamy.   The total cost was $5.74 + tax.  I left with a very happy belly."
5,"Took my fiance' there for Valentine's day/ Birthday.  I did a lot of research of romantic places around the Valley, and this one really caught my eye.  Immediately after walking through the door, you'll notice a dark and romantic ambiance with a lot of candle light.  Seating is a bit tight, but it wasn't bad enough for me to give it a lower review.  We began with an appetizer called ""Table side guacamole"" which was incredible to say the least.  It literally is made in front of your table.  Then it was onto the main dish... Build-your-own  Pork tacos.  Talk about tender meat!!  The shoulder of pork literally fell right off onto the fork.  The tortillas were exceptional, and so was the tasty sauce which included pineapple glaze.  So, the food was absolutely delicious...but the service was equally impressive.  My water level never reached the bottom of the glass the entire night, and I drink plenty!  Everyone was incredibly nice and cheerfully said ""Happy Valentine's Day!"" and ""Happy Birthday!"" to my fiance', which made the experience even better.  A fantastic place that I'll have no problem recommending to others to visit!"
5,I am a Regus member and could get wait here since I could use my membership card. Its a great place situated on 3rd floor with awesome city view.  Complimentary menu is refreshing. Cordial staff. Quiet and relaxed environment. Many TV screens and seatings to get comfortable with.
5,"I've been hearing about these cheesecakes from my husband and his incessant twitter following and I was really excited to try some of the goods at the market this past Saturday. We finally woke up early enough on a Saturday morning to hit up Matt's and then peruse the market before it got too hot.  We made our way over to the cheesecake table and then debated between 10 or so flavors.  He had key lime and chocolate chip out to sample and I decided to try the key lime.  I was amazed at how natural it tasted.  There was nothing artificial about it, it just tasted exactly like it should.  These are very good, very simple cheesecakes.  I ultimately went with the peanut butter chocolate chip which is extremely tasty.  There are a bunch of different sizes to choose from, all at very fair prices.  YUMMY!"
2,"Despite not being Federal employees in any way, Memorial Day seems to be a time when restaurateurs think they deserve a day off, leaving me with few actual lunch options and relegating me to the worst of the worst: Eating. In an AIRPORT RESTAURANT. Turns out that Taberna wasn't actually as bad as all that - the bar is nice to spend a few hours waiting for your flight, and the titular Blue Burrito - despite not being blue in any way, shape or form - wasn't too bad by fast food standards, and quite plentiful for the $8 I spent on it. And if you don't like it, you can cover it with Cholula, close your eyes, and pretend you're eating somewhere better."
4,"Satisfied my sweet and savory liking in a single swath.  Just had my first visit here and will be back soon.  The crepes were tasty and light, the service was attentive and friendly.  Too bad they aren't open later for a sociable evening with dessert and caffeine."
4,"6 inch tuna on white bread, with everything including spinach, but NO pickles. Not even joking, this THE only subway that ever gets my sandwich right. Thank you for the $5 meal deal, it beats the other chains in this shopping plaza as far as price for lunch."
3,"Since I work @ a casino, I'm always checking out the others...Plus, I like to gamble!!  This place is nice, but seemed to be lacking personality. It's new, so it's very clean, w/all new machines. The few employees I dealt with, seemed extremely bored, and a drink girl was nowhere to be found. Because this place is new, and @ the edge of the Phx. area, they don't have to try very hard, and I think it shows."
5,"I really like this place...  Taking the advice of Yelp we stopped in on our way through downtown.  We were immediately greeted as we walked in. I told the staff it was our first time in and asked which sandwich was the best.  Following the recommendation I ordered the Crackerjack, cracked pepper turkey and melted pepper jack cheese with lettuce, tomato, onion and Russian dressing. We also ordered the Godfather, cappicola, salami, pepperoni and melted mozzarella on garlic toasted bread.  Let's take a moment and show the bread some much deserved love. It tastes fresh with a chewy center and crisp exterior covered in sesame seeds. You could put a shoe on this bread and it would taste great.  I really enjoyed the Crackerjack. The Godfather was good for a few bites, but too rich for me.  I can't wait to come back...  Great choice for lunch downtown for a very fair price.  Unless you are completely starving, share a sandwich!"
5,"Okay, if you actually like the taste of good whole foods and fresh ingredients this place is an Oasis of goodness. If your looking for a place that says they make natural foods but uses 2nd rate ingredients and comes up with recipes to hide the fact by using spices to cover it up your better off going somewhere else. My family took me here when we were visiting, and it is wonderful. I had the Pesto Presto sandwich and it was divine! I also tried my family's strawberry fields salad and Arizona rolls. They were all really good. The vegetables were fresh and high quality and the price for the portion and quality was a good price. I was amazed that they had a couple of options for people on the raw foods diet. The juices are different, but surprisingly refreshing. This place is a great example that eating well and health can be tasty and satisfying."
3,"Ok, Stingray has it's high points. It's trendy, hip, and might just explode with young, beautiful people. The atmosphere and decor are nice, but that doesn't completely make up for the fact that the sushi simply falls around the mean. It's average. The menu has a nice selection of rolls and other dishes, and they're good, just not...great. We had a couple different specialty rolls, a tofu dish, soft shell crab, and tempura. Overall it was fresh and well-presented and halfway between actually authentic Japanese and some American Asian fusion food. The bar is crowded if you grab drinks while waiting and the bartenders weren't really fabulous in any way. Same goes for the servers who lack attentiveness and decorum in general. For a place with such a wait, huge crowds, and pretentious hostesses, I'd expect a little more. The curved booths along the sides are nice, though. Oh and, beware, in regards to the well-earned and deserved ""scene"": you might just see/run into every person you want (and don't want) to on a Saturday night."
4,"Wow.  The food and atmosphere here are great.  The music was a little too loud, but, for a weekend away, this place hit the spot perfectly.  The wait was rather lengthy, so we stalked the bar until some folks left, then had our dinner there.  I had the largest shrimp cocktail of my life, some really good wine, and grilled asparagus.  There are so many delicious options in Scottsdale, but, this is pretty specific in vibe. Check it out."
5,"Yeah it was good. My wife & I went with 2 other foodie couples, who are good friends, for our monthly ""side dish"" function.  The food was all fantastic.  All 5 of the other people in our group were drinking martinis, which they all said were very tasty as well, but at $12-$16 per, I'm a little put off.  I'm more of a beer guy anyway, so I had a couple of craft-brews that are not available everywhere, and then settled on a Firestone DBA -- a very very tasty beer -- and had several of those.  Great food, great booze, club music atmosphere is pretty cool. Outdoor area is excellent. Felt like an idiot when I had to ask where the mens room was only to turn around and find that the huge wall of a door was right behind me and said ""he"" in huge letters on the bottom of the door.  Oh and then (6 or 7 strong beers into the evening) I found that the mirror next to the (only) urinal in the mens room misled me into believing there was a second urinal, which I tried unsuccessfully to walk to.  Why is that guy walking directly toward me?  Oh, it's me.  In the mirror. Dumbass.  So then (after relieving myself in the actual urinal) I go back out to the table to tell the story about trying to use the urinal in the mens room that doens't exist, and somebody else says ""yeah the same fucking thing happened to me too!"" so I don't feel like such a dumbass anymore.  Fun night."
5,What a place for brunch. $4 drinks are fantastic. Their tenderloin egg Benedict and sea food sandwich is heavenly. Wish we had such a place in Los Angeles.
1,"While the menu looked promising, have no idea if the food is any good since the hostess failed to even acknowledge our presence when we walked in the door.   We patiently stood there for several minutes while she walked around us to greet and seat two other parties.   Since we were still unable to get her attention,  we left and went to Tommy Bahama across the street."
3,"Other then the chips and salsa (5 stars for salsa) the food is good, but not so much that I go out of my way to eat there. The fajitas are delish, with mushrooms and the meat always tender, but the price makes me cringe. At over $20 there are so many other places I rather eat. I usually opt for a cheese crisp with green onions and green chilies and a side of guacamole (which is always yummy but pricey) and I still pay for all that $15 plus what ever we are drinking.... I love the overly rustic atmosphere, but it really could use some updating and maybe a good scrub.... Some of the servers are not the friendliest, but these are mostly the family that work there and have been there forever, so don't take it personally.... But overall it is a Scottsdale landmark that is fun to bring out of towers to and the food is overall good."
5,"I absolutely love the food here!  The sushi and Walnut Shrimp are cravings that I must give in to.  This is a nice, small restaurant that is exceptionally clean and comfortable. Good for a casual date, lunch any day (their specials are a great deal), and the owner managers are on site most hours they are open.  You have to try the Walnut Shrimp!"
4,"I love this place!!! Lots of space and cheap, TASTY Mexican food. Not much more than that needs to be said."
5,"Like Sex or Tobacco? Hells yeah!!!! were not looking for vanilla yes' here, this place pulls out all the stops If  Ichi Yakaguru the new york club promoter and 9yo Japanese pimp needed anything, it could be found here. The best selection of DVD's and printed material i have come by in awhile... lots of Toys so much stuff a lot of it is hung above the head, so look up. Lingerie, Tobacco, Human Fire Hydrants, Hobos with Soap Sud Beards"
2,"When I heard about this company opening in the valley, I was pretty excited.  Something new!!!  But when I got to one of these stores, I was disappointed. Imagine:  A smaller Whole Foods meets IKEA.  Sounds interesting doesn't it?  Unfortunately they do not execute it very well.  There was nothing there that I couldn't get at Trader Joes at a lower price.  There wasn't any thing new or even different.  Sure you can get your Tide, Crest toothpaste and some other name brands there, but the place seemed to lack a soul. If you need just one thing, this would be a good place to run in and out.  But if your looking to do the bulk of your shopping here...why not just go to Safeway? Maybe that's the point, but what really shocked me is that the prices here were not any better than Fry's or Safeway.  Trader Joes at least has really cheap prices and you know 90% your getting high quality stuff.  Plus TJ's is different from your normal shopping experience....the marketing is fun and the stuff you get there you generally cannot get anywhere else.  I did not sense any of this with Fresh and Easy.  It seemed sterile. If you like F&E....good for you!!!   I just don't see the value nor the selection.  The idea of this place is great.  They just don't get the American market."
5,"The food in this place is indescribably awesome! Granted, the place could be nicer, but if you're in the mood for great food without the frills of a great looking place: this is it. The service is fast, friendly, and the prices are great- especially knowing that their portions are typically huge. I can't finish my plate most of the time, so I always end up taking leftovers home.  I love their Jade Red Chicken, as well as their emerald chicken. Their black beans are to die! Order a combo plate, if this is your first time here. You'll get a good mix of everything and you'll leave without regrets!"
4,"Fabulous.  Holy Kobe Beef Burger with Avocado, Bacon, and Cheese - It was the special of the day. I didnt care what it cost, I knew I had to have it.  Come to think of it, that was the FIRST time in my life I've never ordered off the menu and actually went for the ""of the day"". I did it with my wine too! I wasnt a HUGE fan of the parmesan fries, but I could be alone here.  All in all, great place for some burger lovin! The milkshakes at the other table looked unreal!"
5,"Good reviews are easy to write. Stop reading this and just go eat there!  OK, well I have visited this place for years now and don't go anywhere else if I am in this area.  I like the Chef's, they are friendly and quick. They speak pretty good Spanish to me and but I don't dare try to respond in Japanese, ha ha.  The value is phenomenal, where can two people get miso soup, salad, beans, tea, ice cream and sushi rolls all for under $20?  I've tried the same at Say Sushi in my hometown of Maricopa and can't do it for under $40 or more for two.  All you can eat is available but I find that ordering individually is more economical.  Great atmosphere for a quick lunch or a large party for dinner.  The waitresses are Asian and I find that suitable for the restaurant. Some reviews on here complain about them. I don't have any issue with them they have always treated me nice and done their job well.  I will keep coming back."
4,"So we decided to come back and give this place another  try and it was  a lot better than our first experience!  We had the fondue first, which was more than enough for 2 people to share.  I had the chicago dog, again and my bf had a hamburger.  The service was awesome and our waitress made sure we had more than enough wine!  Looks like Windsor has been ironing out their kinks and really making it into a cool, fun space to hang out and eat!"
5,"I'm a regular at Lux. Haven't reviewed it out of sheer laziness. And it's usually laziness that brings me here: when I have a major thingie to get done by Day B but I spent all of Day A at the office surfing the Internet instead of working on it, I pay the price with an all-nighter, which I like to start at Lux. (Damn them for not being open past 10). This is usually the story when anyone spots me here.  I'll grab a small table for myself, plug in my laptop (free wifi), spread out my papers everywhere, then go up to the counter for a large and extremely delicious Velvet Latte. When it's done right, there's a perfect swirl of white cream that forms the shape of a leaf on the surface of the caramel-colored coffee. Mmm. Since I am ADD I take frequent breaks of course. Like every 3 minutes. Whenever I hear a strange piece of music I really like that I've never heard before (this happens often), I strain to catch part of the lyrics, stick it into Google, find the name of the band, stick it into iTunes and download it. I'm not making that up. Like half my music collection was created through this method. The last few bands I downloaded tracks from are... let me open up my iTunes... Kasabian, Feist, and the Detroit Cobras. I'm not even remotely hip enough to have heard of those before on my own."
3,"i too came because of a living social deal, as it turned out it really didn't save us any money.  the buffet is odd. lots of different kinds of food. onion rings, fries, chicken nuggets with baked cheese eggplant, stuffed grape leaves, hummus. i sampled a bit of everything. i liked the soup, very nice, i couldn't identify the spice, i don't know anything about mediterranean food. but i know what i like. i like 3 different olive dominated dishes, i wish i could cook eggplant that kept it shape this well. i liked the hot pita bread. i loved salad with big chucks of feta cheese. there where several tasty chicken dishes that were excellently seasoned with big chucks of flavorful chicken. the american staples, probably for the kids and unadventuresome guests was bland and a bit dry, expected for a buffet, where the food sits out under lights. advice: group the foods by origin, not by meat, vegies, salad. make up a route down one side of the serving table, greek, turkish, Lebanese.  make it a learning experience, tell us which dishes use olives, what kinds of spices. if you want people to come back teach them a little bit about the food, share the culture, don't mix chickem mcnuggets with a tasty pulled chicken dish just because they both have chicken in them. tell me why this is good food, help me learn something the cook knows about his homeland. so i walk down one side and get a greek-turkish meal. the other side is another culture, then one side for the bland american food. as is everything was mixed up. now, i'm going back again. with my laptop and a notepad, and hungry. i'm going to taste each dish by label- if i don't know what it is, i'm going to sit down and google it. i'm going to learn where it's from and what spices are in it. i'm going to make my own learning experience. if the owners sit down with me and explain how their food expresses their culture, i'll rate it 5 stars next time. it's a family business, it's a huge building, it has a good talented cook(s) somewhere in the kitchen, it is good tasting food. it needs to be displayed and presented differently. it wasn't busy, a shame, industrialized food is always bland and busy. now, if you grew up with these dishes, you can leave a review about their tastiness and authenticity. that would help."
2,"I was so excited to find this place, less than a minute down the street from home! Because I'm not a big panda express fan, but I love Chinese food. Sadly, I was disappointed.  The orange chicken was very stringy and tasteless. The sweet and sour sauce was runny and mostly sour. The wontons were the only decent thing we ate there.  If you want good, cheap chinese avoid this place and try Li's Bowl on 35th ave."
4,"This is one of very few East Valley theaters that has online ticketing through Fandango. The auditoriums have true stadium seating, and the chairs are spacious, and comfortably recline. The arm rests are movable, so you can snuggle with your honey while watching a movie. The picture quality is amazing!!! I only wish this theater offered a military discount, like it's Tucson Cinemark counterparts."
5,"The sushi was fresh and excellent! The service was almost too fast. I did not find the prices to be out of line with the quality.  Our daughter loved the miso soup. The one thing I really appreciated is that they will make what you want, whether it is on the menu or not. If they have it, you can get it. I know we'll be going there often.  One thing though, this is a busy, noisy place. It is not large either. If you are looking for quite and relaxed, this perhaps isn't the best choice. If you want good food in a noisy cheerful atmosphere, like a bunch of friends or after work, this fits the bill."
4,"My new favorite Mexican place in Tempe. Love their tacos. Their menu only lists them individually, but feel free to mix and match. I usually go with one camarone and one pescado. The shrimp are small, but there are lots of 'em. And the chunks of fried fish are bigger than the taco itself. Portions are generous - I'd have to skip breakfast to be able to finish more than two. Service is friendly and efficient - easy to get in and out during your lunch hour. Also a great spot for happy hour."
5,"This Mexican restaurant has the best burritos in town!  This is not your roach infested 24 hour drive through kind of burrito joint either.  Here are the reasons that make La Tolteca #1 and one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix! 1-Full bakery with mouth watering fresh pastries 2-Fresh ingredients and great prices 3-Also serves beer if you feel like having a Corona with your meal as opposed to take out 4-Little market has the best prices in town on citrus fruits and just enough of everything to cook up a little Mexican meal (Ranch Market not needed!) 5-Make your own pico/ salsa bar, make it your style and get as much of it as you want:) So, if you are downtown looking for authentic Mexican this is the place.  Of course it is super casual take out or seat yourself kind of place so don't  try to flatter your date here! But get there early, I'm pretty sure they close up shop by 9 or 10..."
3,"Yelp pointed me to this place while on a business trip-- looking for good pizza in the area.  Kind of a mixed result.  The restaurant is located in a strip mall, sort of hidden in one of the back corners.  Walk in thinking fast food, but turns out it's sit down.  Why does it seem all the burger and pizza joints in this area are sit down-- odd...  Anyway, I got three slices.  Quality was ok-- a bit doughy and filling, I couldn't make it through all three.  Lots of free refills was a nice touch on a 105 degree day.  Staff were really friendly, and, oh yeah-- it was cheap!   Less than 6 bucks for more pizza than I could eat and bottomless coke.  So, great value, nice service, just ok pizza, though."
5,"So Jimmy, tell the class what you saw at Sweeties! ""OK, well, I saw lots of candy. Old-timey candy and cool candy and neat candy. Lots of it. Real lots."" ""And I saw people walking around with baskets and talking about candy. And talking about candy when they were little.  And talking about what candy they should get for their kids."" ""Oh, and I saw Turkish Taffy, Maple Bun Bars, Fruit Stripe Gum, Moon Pies, Cherry Mash, Mary Janes, Valomilk Candy Bars,Sen Sen Packs, Goo Goo Clusters, Squirrel Nut Zippers, Flipstick Lipstick, Licorice Pipes, Zero Bars, Twin Bings, Look Bars, Abba-Zabba Bars and U-No Bars.  And that was only a little of it.  And lots of other stuff."" ""Teach?"" ""Yes Jimmy?"" ""The coolest teacher ever would take her class to Sweeties."" ""Would they?"" ""Yes."""
5,"Tasty fair trade organic coffee and breakfast and lunch. Even have almond milk!  Excellent choices. Super nice people. Comfortable space. Let's help support these independent shops who exude caring, quality and individuality to thrive in our community!"
4,"It seems totally unbelievable that, not only did I hang out for more than an hour at a mall, but an outside one at that in 115-degree heat. I attribute my ability to withstand these two unfavorable conditions to two things: Bonnie  Tea Infusion    It was Bonnie's choice to grab some drinks at what she described as a ""great, independently owned tea shop"" located at Tempe Marketplace. I'm not a tea connoisseur by any means, and I generally distrust fads (i.e., this silly-sounding thing called ""boba"" tea), but I agreed cause if  Bonnie likes it, it's gotta be worth checking out, right?  Parking wasn't too much of a hassle on a Sunday afternoon, and we surprisingly got a space close to an entrance to the ""District,"" just outside of Barnes and Noble. Inside, the shop looked much like a Starbucks - and I don't mean to imply that it was uninspired or anything. It was clean, modern and consisted of a long counter behind which two employees busily hand-mixed tea and smoothie concoctions, along with a few tables/chairs.  The menu was extensive and separated into ""black,"" ""green"" and ""white"" teas, any of which I could get hot or cold...I think. I picked the tropics white in iced form, and B got my second choice, a peach mix white. Both were pretty delicious. There was also a selection of sandwiches and snacks that I did not sample - next time. I also ran into a good friend there who was delighted by the fact that they had this mystical ""boba,"" and so ordered a Chai-type version with blueberry-sized and -shaped balls floating on the bottom, and an oversized straw to facilitate sucking them up along with the drink. I tried one boba ball and it was gelatinous and chewy - not at all like what I expected - and an odd sensation, but I would totally order one the next time I'm in.  Being in the District and flanked by stores like ""Hottie Inc."" and Guess, there were several teens inside hanging out in large numbers - boo. So, we decided to sit outside for as long as we could stand it. I was surprised to find that the several shaded tables and misters made for a pretty comfortable environment, and we hung out for a good hour or so before I got so sweaty I have to get mobile.   So, in summary, I would totally come back. Probably before or after a movie, to grab a drink and support an independent store among a mecca of chain retail. Plus, right across the way there is an ASU art gallery (closed Sunday and Monday) that we peeked into and actually cool, interesting sculpture art by local artist and asu instructor David Young.   Touche, the District at Tempe Marketplace - I have to say I am impressed!"
1,"Wednesday 7pm.  This place is your average over priced, lack of taste chain food restaurant and this place was no different.  I have to say, I was super disappointed as I have always heard rave reviews, now I'm starting to question who I associate with and their taste in food. Service=slow. Food=just tastes like salt Noise=loud and they do a dance...like a lot. Go somewhere else and skip Joe's Crabs."
4,"I'm glad I made a second trip to Papago before writing a review, because they have redeemed themselves from my original visit. The problem with my first visit was two-fold: 1) The beers that were most interesting to me had run dry; 2) The food I ordered was pretty hard to grunt down. And although I sat at the bar with my compadre and tried to make conversation with the bartender about the different beers offered, it was fairly one-sided. I did not get a dose of craft beer expertise from what is arguably a brewpub that showcases a true love for beer. So regardless of the less-than-stellar first visit, I still was impressed with the selection of draft beer especially the regional offerings. The built-in beer coolers are also a testament to a great place to sample different labels. The one thing I must caution others against is the food. The steak sandwich I ordered (with special gardiniera) was pretty lousy. The beef had a precooked-then frozen-then reheated quality. The gardiniera was essentially all jalapeños and too fiery to eat... I had to scrape a fair amount of them off to make it edible. I had a good time drinking some decent beers with my friend, but we both regretted our food choice. My return visit restored my faith. The beer list was current and updated. There was a large variety of new draft beers to choose from, and my group ordered two pizzas. This place has delicious pizza! Our waiter was especially knowledgeable about the beers being offered and was able to help us choose especially interesting ones. I like the atmosphere and crowd at Papago and intend to return. But I will definitely stick to the pizza."
5,"Torn between review Fez Foodies, the periodic event that allows patrons to participate in sampling yet-to-be-added menu item and tweak them based on responses and the actual restaurant that hosts said event and providing a CenPho restaurant that combines innovative cuisine with ambiance and amazing service, I settled on the latter. Because without the brick-and-mortar there would be no former.  So, tonight for the first time Robert M and I joined the Fez Foodies for a sneak peak at a few items that will be coming to a plate near you. The raspberry spinach salad was wonderful. The steak with mushrooms and smashed red potatoes might need another consideration but was still a pleasant entree. Honestly, I look forward to returning and getting these items, because Fez actually takes customer input/suggestions and applies them.  Fez is one of those locations where I've never gotten anything but terrific service and a great meal. I'm fond of the garlic and rosemary fries but my coworkers and friends and strangers on the light rail think I should limit myself on these as some people don't appreciate the proven medical benefits of bucket-loads of garlic and shovelfuls of rosemary. Tools.  Not surprisingly, Thomas was a peach of a host. Forgive me if I seemed disinterested in conversation: we just returned from Rim Country and that experience killed my ass."
3,"The pizza is just OK. Pretty crowded at lunch time and seating is a nightmare. Get the lunch special, you get a personal pizza slicer and a pan. Would get it to go if I didn't live in the west valley. Good idea to have a separate take out door but don't count on this place to be acceptable for those of us with disabilities to get around."
4,"We got in late and had an early departure the next day. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our room was spacious and the bed was very comfy. The amenities were decent, however there was no shower cap or q-tips.  There was Wi-Fi, but it wasn't the best. The outside was beautiful, being surrounded by green always makes the desert better.I didn't get the chance to use the swimming pool.  I would definitely recommend this hotel. Next time, I will make time to be able to use the swimming pool."
5,"All I have to say is get the California Club. I live in the East Coast and I still crave for the sandwich. I wish I had the chance to try other things on the menu. The drive-thru concept is pretty neat, but there was a bit of a wait. Guess you can't rush perfection."
3,"Sauce has grown on me... particularly this location since this is the one I frequently end up at for a quick lunch or casual dinner spot near home. I typically order chopped salads at lunch.  The chopped turkey & feta salad is what I had today.  I had them add asparagus, which was a great call if I may say so myself!  The large salad and fresh roll is the perfect lunch... fresh, filling, healthy enough, and pretty inexpensive when it comes to designer salads around town.  I also like the spinach, pancetta & goat cheese and the veggie & aged parmesan salads.   My husband eats at Sauce often as well... he goes for a salad or sandwich.  Last time we were there together, he had the salami, turkey, prosciutto & mozzarella panini.  I had a bite and was pleasantly surprised! It had a nice balance of thin sliced meat, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and tangy red wine vinegar in between two perfectly grilled pieces of bread.  The thin crust pizzas are pretty decent also.  Depending on your appetite, sharing a pizza and a salad with your companion can work out to be a satisfactory meal...  What I like about Sauce the most? Fast, friendly, and efficient service in a clean and casual environment.  The moderate pricing is also a big plus in my book... especially in this economy."
1,"I brought my sweet sister in law shopping at this Forever 21 location.  She had a bag full of goodies (several hundreds of dollars worth) from H&M.  She stopped at Forever 21 and  sat her bag on the ground right beside her while she tried on a pair of shoes.  Her H&M bag was stolen during that brief moment that the bag was not in her arms.....and while this certainly was not the responsibility of Forever 21....we were so disappointed in the way the Forever 21 staff reacted. They did not call security, or the police, or even offer any condolences.  They just shrugged their shoulders.  My sister in law did love some of the fashions at Forever 21....but the store was such a mess.  There were clothes all over the floor under each and every rack.  There were way too few staff members working, and many who were working were ""socializing"" with one another instead of helping customers or maintaining the store inventory in a decent fashion. The only employees that were on task were:  1 at the checkout, and 1 at the fitting rooms - there was a band of 5 girls dressing one mannequin while the store was amidst in chaos (including someone stealing bags from other customers)..... So - if you choose to shop at this store - hold on to your bags :)"
2,"I'm sitting here as I write this.I'm thoroughly unimpressed.  With its bare white walls and sparse attempts at decor, this place is overly and unreasonably obnoxious. Despite not being crowded, and there never being more than one person in front of me each time, I had to wait on line.  With two people working behind the counter there's no reason to forget my order or make me wait 5+ minutes each time I needed something (to get my coffee, to ask for the Internet password, and then to remind them that I ordered coffee). Unfortunately the coffee supplied was  mediocre as best. Disruptive music selection that was too damn loud. Annoying..thank God for pandora.com, a good set of ear-bud, and reasonable wi-fi or I never would have gotten any work done. The only reason I'd come back here is if my son had another concert to attend nearby. Needless to say, I do not recommend."
5,"My wife and I celebrated our anniversary here for the first time. I have nothing but good things to say. Food, wait staff and overall experience were excellent. This is an old school type of steakhouse with red velvet wallpaper, leather booths, etc. If you haven't been, I can't recommend it highly enough. Give it a try and you'll be glad you did!"
3,The veg burger is fantastic - make sure you ask to try all the different aioli sauces especially with the tots!
3,"Okay.....so....I have this thing about going out in Scottsdale in the first place because I'm always like ""that one natural haired black girl"" in a sea of blonde, tan, slim chicas! But that's neither here nor there.  The Lodge was OKAY in my opinion. For it to be in Scottsdale where everything is super expensive for no reason the drinks are pretty cheap. I had a couple of shots and a drink and spent under $20. The bartender was SUPER sweet and she knew my name by the time I came back for my 3rd drink.  They have AH-MAZING food deals. Like, get a burger and a beer for $6. Of course it's not a top notch beer but.....who doesn't love burgers and beers?? There is music...coming from somewhere and it's always pretty legit, a good mix.  There is like an intimate, cabin sort of corner with flickering romance lights when you first walk in if you want privacy but we usually go outside to the deck and people watch and/or play cornhole....Either way, I wouldn't say this is my favorite place ever...but I dont hate it either.  Plus there is always a line of cabs outside waiting if you are too schwasted to get home :)!"
4,"Wow. Reading all these reviews makes UofP sound like a terrible, degree mill.  I am shocked! I have learned SO much which getting my MBA. The vast majority of my professors have been knowledgeable, available, and thorough. My peers have been inspiring and helpful.  When I graduate in June I know I will be leaving with much more than when I began."
2,"Being the only gay bar in Scottsdale aside from BS West, I've found myself at Forbidden a few times.  Forbidden is an ambitious concept--a gay club with two rooms and two deejays in a city not known for its gay nightlife. Sadly Forbidden does not deliver.   The club is usually pretty busy on a Saturday night, but the crowd leaves a bit to be desired.  The patrons are mostly unattractive, kind of trashy in fact, and not very friendly.   I believe deejay in the main room does not change on the weekends, where he spins top 40 dance/pop to a drunk college-aged crowd.  In the OZ room (the smaller room) they have different local deejays, who, from what I've seen, spin a variety of different types of music--sometimes it's circuity music, sometimes it's eighties music, it all depends on the deejay for that night.  The OZ room has been pretty empty the few times I've been there.  The sound system in both rooms leaves quite a bit to be desired from a place that calls itself a club.   The drinks are reasonably priced for a bar in Scottsdale.   The décor is okay, but not very interesting.  Forbidden isn't terrible.  It is, however, just plain boring (bad music on a bad sound system, uninteresting décor, and an unimpressive and unfriendly crowd)!"
5,I've been going here for 10 years. My relationship began when I needed a bunch of clothes tailored for my first trip to Europe. I needed everything quickly and was very specific. She got everything done in time for my trip.  Over the years I've brought dozens of clothes. She's done everything from changing a dress into a top to adding bra pads to a cocktail dress. She's hemmed and taken in. She's shortened straps and helped me change out fabric in clothing to create a completely different look. I can communicate anything I want and she'll have it done exactly the way I envisioned it. We've been able to change things so much we sometimes recreate new looks.  Her prices are a little high but well worth the quality. Every single person I've recommended has been extremely pleased with her work.
2,"This is tough, because I REALLY wanted to like this place! What killed it for me? The lack of professionalism that was presented when my fiance and I came to look at this venue. I will admit that we were 10 minutes late to our appointment, however I do not think this warrants being treated like a herd of cattle. First when I called the venue to make an appointment whoever picked up the line sounded as if they were in a rush and not even interested in making the appointment which was the first turn off. Upon arrival, we walked into another entrance thinking it was the main entrance, then we were re-directed by an employee to the adjacent door. As we walked out there was (I don't even remember her name), the wedding coordinator waiting. She quickly greeted us then had us sit down as she began to talk about the venue.  Usually when you want to sell the venue you run, you'd think you would see someone with a little enthusiasm and fire explaining why their venue is so amazing. Well, we didn't get that from this individual. What did we get? A quick 10 minute spiel about what they do and the services provided and 3 wedding books shoved in our faces as examples then a quick 10 minute tour of the place. That's it, no effort, no emotion, no interest in wanting to get to 'know us' and get a feel for what kind of wedding we would like to have, just a quick, here is the place, goodbye. She was very snooty and acted as if she was not in the mood to showcase the venue. So why two stars instead of zero? One star is for the venue itself. It is very chic, modern, yet elegant. The reception area is beautifully decorated and where the ceremony is held is beautiful as well! There are many ways one can decorate this place! The other star is the PRICE. This venue offers all inclusive packages at unbeatable prices. I mean an all inclusive package where they provide virtually everything for roughly 100 guests is $9495.00 taxes and gratuity included!!! That's a steal, trust me, I've looked into a TON of venues, you will not find an all inclusive price as cheap as this.  Honestly, if my fiance and I were the only individuals funding our wedding, then we probably would have considered this place (more than likely, VEGAS). However, given the type of customer service that was displayed, we took our business elsewhere."
3,"Well it was off to Brio last night for ""date"" night!!!   The last time we were at Brio was in September to celebrate our 16th Anniversary...yes consecutive years, and it was a great evening!  Last night, no so much.  In all the years we've been going to Brio, we have NEVER had such HORRIBLE service....ever! The food was as amazing as it always is, but the terrible service completely overshadowed the tasty treats from the kitchen.  Our server stood and waited for us to finish sitting and before we could even open our napkins was asking for our drink order, not a good sign of things to come.  So I opted for water to come while we contemplated our cocktails.  So the water came, then nothing....nothing....no one....nada.  After about 10 minutes the server returned for our cocktail order.  The longest 10 minutes in history I'll admit.  So off to get the drinks....15 minutes later they arrived with the bread for the table...now mind you we'd been sitting alone at the table with no attention for 25 minutes now.  That is a lifetime for a restaurant that makes their money by turning tables.  When the drinks and bread arrived we opted to put in our dinner order, thinking we'd be in for a long bumpy night.  So we ordered, I ordered the Campanelle Carbonara, but with the Spicy Pepper Sauce from the Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant Appetizer, as opposed to the traditional sauce.  The server said no problem, you want the Angel Hair Pasta with the Spicy Sauce, do you want to add Shrimp or Chicken???  Well the Campanelle Carbonara comes with Chicken, Spinach, Bacon, and Parmesan Cheese.  So I explained it is NOT Angel hair Pasta as the Campanelle is a 'trumpet' shaped pasta with curled edges.  He said ""Oh you want the Lasagna Noodles"".....!  Of course I just said ask the chef to prepare the entree as he usually would, BUT, substitute the sauces.  Glenn ordered the same, but with the traditional sauce.  We both opted for the wedge salad, and asked that our entrees not be fired until we were completed with our salad.  After all, we all know all the ingredients are pre-made, and just needed to be assembled and heated..  Whew...I felt...that was exhausting!  Then the salads arrived.  Ice cold, yummy...!  Now we are back on track.  Boy that salad does hit all the notes that take you back to your childhood.  Nothing is better than Ice Cold Iceberg Lettuce w/blue cheese dressing, bacon crumbles, and fresh shaved Parmesan cheese!!!   Then it happened.....yes just as we thought, in order to speed up the process that started so slowly............our entrees arrive BEFORE we were even 1/2 way through our salads.  So there they sit...all beautiful, completed just as ordered...and no Lasagna Noodles, no Angel Hair Pasta...just the wonderfulness awaiting our forks.  But...yes...But, we'd not finished our salads.  By the time we did, our pasta was sad, cold, and looked like it had let us down.  It didn't, OUR SERVER DID....oh by the way were we EVER asked if we wanted anything else to drink???  You guessed it NO....were we EVER asked how our dinner was???  You guessed it NO... Now you're probably saying, 'why didn't you do something about it'?  We'd have loved to, but there was no one around...not even someone to fill our water glasses.  Only after we were finished with our sad, cold, entrees and had stacked all the dirty dishes in a pile on the edge of the table, did our server make an appearance to ask how our dinner is going??? Are you kidding me???  We just asked for the check.  Upon his return we presented him with the discount that Brio had sent us for being frequent diners, he took that and never returned.  After sitting there at an empty table, empty water glasses and nothing to look at but the crumbs left behind from the wonderful flat bread.  We placed cash on the table and left to try to reclaim our evening.  On the way out, Glenn finally spotted a manager and explained our evening and that it would be a VERY LONG time before we tried Brio again.  He, the manager, just stumbled over his words and said he wished he's known about our evening so he could have done something about it.  Well maybe if he'd been circulating on the floor as opposed to hanging out with the ever so cute hostess' he'd have known.  Do we still like Brio...YES...are we extremely disappointed with our service last night...YES....."
5,"Coffee talk is a nice surprise nestled in the hum drum downtown of Mesa. I have been enjoying their coffee and live talent since I was fifteen. When I was in High School it was a ritual to hit the local dollar movie and then end the night with some coffee at coffee talk. I think the best part was hitting on boys and trying to pass as being at least eighteen years old. My reasons for going to Coffee Talk have changed over the past decade, but the atmosphere and quality drinks and pastries have not changed. There is nothing better than sitting on their back patio and enjoying the cool breeze of the fall. There is something about that place that brings me a sense of relaxation. If you enjoy artistic ambiance, coffee, and live performance's then I would recommend Coffee Talk."
5,Loved the burgers and the onion rings were fabulous!  This place is a must visi if you are in the Phoenix area anytime soon!
5,"It's a restaurant in a gas station, but it merits five stars b/c it has glass bottles of soda, just like you find in Mexico.  Good food too.  It's actually not nearly as bad inside as you'd think, it's pretty well set apart from the gas station sales, so I wouldn't mind eating there.  They have a few tables set up inside.  I usually get takeout though (they also deliver).   MANZANA LIFT ROCKS!!!  I'm also going to be drinking the Sprite in the bottle, (cane sugar ftw) and the horchata.  I don't care about Chipotle opening near work anymore, I've found a new Mexican fix for lunch.  What a happy day."
4,"So I am not usually in the Tempe area, but a friend told me about this place. So I though I would go try it out. I got a Grande Latte that was around $4. Not a bad price. But what made it worth it was that I guess this Friday I went was a Free Shot Friday. So I got an extra Espresso shot in my latte making it a triple for $4 bucks...no that is a deal. Not sure if they always have the promotion on Fridays. But it sure did make my morning a little better. Their menu is very easy to read and give those no too educated in the was of coffee a good description of what each drink is and how it is made. The had a ton of great looking pastries even though I didn't sample any. Cakes, Eclairs, Scones, and I think even what looked like cheesecake.  The decor was very interesting. An old fashion coffee house meets a gypsy vibe. I think they have Wifi too. I saw a few people on there computers. The service was a little slow I think. Felt like I was waiting for my drink for 10 minutes and the place was not really that busy. This was probably because of the guy ahead of me when I walked in who had about 7 different modifications to his drink. I have worked in a coffee place and those people are kind of annoying. So I will let them slide on the time of service. Overall a great experience. Would have been 3 stars, but when you get something for free, in my book that is an automatically another star."
5,This place is so great! I am a nanny and had to bring in a dance outfit to get the straps shorten for the girl I care for. The woman did this for no charge! It was only the second time I went there. She said it would only take her two minutes so no charge. She was super sweet!
5,"Our go to pizza place! Don't see how they could improve in any area. Customer service is excellent, immaculately clean and the food is PERFECTION!"
2,So sad closed. Oh well.
1,"Look it upsets me that you have to give even one star.  I can read the other reviews and I have been here more than a few times but tonight it was just beyond a bad dinner.  Yes, we were the table of 7 people at about 8pm, yes we were group at the high top tables that were pushed together. You would have to remember us because we were the table that had 1/2 of a waiter. It was so nice of you to take the time to take our order and then let the waiter go home because he had been there since lunch.  You know what sucks more than working 2 shifts? How about being the last table for the guy who worked 2 shifts, it was so nice of the manager to let him leave, but hey how about taking the time to have someone FINISH the open orders?  Simply the food was not good and you are over priced. But the worst part is that your staff is just not good at their job, THEY DONT CARE and that is a result of MANAGEMENT not caring."
4,"Place is clean, staff is friendly...I love that it's kind of a one stop shop and the self serve yogurt shop connects to the water and ice next door.  You can get what ever cold confection you are craving from Thrifty's ice cream, shaved ice, yogurt or smoothies...an added bonus is they stay open late 7 days a week!"
4,"Looking for good Philadelphia street eats? Well, Forefathers Cheesesteaks & Fries is the place for you! While Forefathers' is light on Philadelphia decor like the Liberty Bell, the sandwiches would give fan favorite Philly restaurants like Pat's, Geno's or Jim's a run for their money. And you don't have to be a Cheese Whiz fan. The gooey provolone on my sandwich left my mouth watering. The sweet potato fries were equally good. Be sure to sample the available dipping sauces like ranch, honey mustard, or (my fave) fries sauce. The next time you're in the mood for cholesterol count busting goodness, be sure to check this place out. Even Ben Franklin wouldn't need his bifocal specs to see that Forefathers is worth a fry...oops, I mean, try."
5,"Only 4 stars?  (A few notes: The folks that rated this place low must have been isolated incidences and I feel weigh far to heavy on service rather than product. Dining at a restaurant, rate the service a lil' harder, but a coffee shop, hold your tongue.) Anyway, this place rocks. We aren't super close, but we pass up several coffee shops en route to Lola because the quality is top drawer. The beans, fair trade, and the roast is perfect. The price of a bag of beans is amazing. Doing right by the farmers and then respecting the product with such a solid roast. This is what is all about! I have yet to find a better americano. A splash of cream and a splenda only augments the flavor of the espresso and the richness really shines. I've been to most of the independent coffee shops throughout the area, and if I do find myself elsewhere, I can only compare them to Lola, and Lola wins out each time."
4,"I was only here for one night on 9/7, but I was very pleased with my stay.  The place is beautiful, the rooms are big, and the people at the front desk were pleasant and efficient. The only down side to my stay was that I lost water pressure in the shower Friday night.  Fortunately, it was only brief.  Other than that, I enjoyed my stay.  This will be my base of operations for my next visit. As for others' comments that there isn't anything nearby - That's what cars are for.  Last I heard you can rent them here and there."
4,"If your boyfriend is a baseball player and is in Spring training.... Watch out for the heat...as it gets SOOO HOOOOOT and SOOOO DRY...... i literally had to stand with my legs apart and my hands on my waist to air what needs to be aired. Yup. Support thy boyfriend..... I can't wait to come back here this May for Minor League Spring training! I probably will be wearing a bikini and a see through dress.  But really..I've never seen fields so well managed here... I've only been to where the Royals practice....and It's quite amazing! This May, i'd definitely see games at the Texas side."
5,"I've gone back a few times since my last review. Every single experience has been fantastic! The burgers are pretty good, BUT do yourself a favor and get the pork tenderloin OMFG!!! Sooooo freaken amazing!  Also their onion rings are pretty much perfect!  And the fried cheese curd...just get it! I was a little creeped out eating something called cheese curd, but holy deliciousness!"
5,"Feeling yucky one day and wanting nothing but some reminders of my bay area asian food... My search began with my iPhone for Pho.. AND I wanted good Pho.. (Im skeptical of some dishes in the desert, just sayin'!).. I drove a good 20min from my loft to find this place.. worth it. Usual toppings you will find with real Vietnamese Pho.. but awesome! I asked for a variety of tofu and seafood.. I couldnt finish it all.. but never can with Pho.. its a big bowl, and filling!  Extras on tables to get your Pho on..  Ordered the Vietnamese Shrimp Rolls too.. left feeling not so stuffy! AND full.. OH yeah, and I still had money for a bit of shoe shopping the next day... :-)"
5,"Not that you can compare Firebird to anywhere else in Az but I have been to Joliet Raceway in Chicago (and even though that's newer) I like the arrangement of Firebird and the availability of the different tracks available to race on. First off...  NHRA... come on... hands down one of THE coolest events in Az ever, next to NASCAR and well pro any sports but the 8000hp cars come only once a year.  The pits are setup nice so every ticket gets into the pits to check out the teams and cars, beer and food are expensive but what else is new. They also have drag racing events, any type of racing event, drift, road, moto races, dirt bikes, monster trucks, top fuel drag boats on the lake... I'm sure I'm missing a lot but nowhere else has this in Az. Parking is always good to go... driving out of there just takes a while as you've got one main road that you get on to funnel onto the I-10 but not much they can do about that. Great place... keep bringing in the NHRA and letting us use the road tracks for our motorcycles and I'll be happy."
3,I was here for a business dinner recently and loved their new hummus plate.  They put grilled zucchini on it and had some fresh jicama which was awesome.  I wasn't in the mood for BBQ at the time but so I ordered a turkey burger which came on a whole wheat bun and some steamed broccoli.  I love the healthy options.  Thanks to Red Robin for helping to fight the battle of the bulge.  Just make sure you bring lots of will power when come here because it's easy to blow it...especially with the desert menu!!
5,"Where to begin? This is my favorite Mexican food establishment ever. I've been frequenting Carolina's for years and never once have I been disappointed. Some might compare it to Filiberto's or any of those [insert surname here]berto's but this is on a whole different level. Atmosphere-wise it's one step above a sketchy hole-in-the-wall but the food makes up for everything the appearance of the place lacks. I don't know their secret but their beans, the tortillas, the salsa... it's all to die for. And IT'S. SO. CHEAP. Like, seriously, I'd dish out more money for this food but the fact that it really is that cheap is the icing on the cake.  It's almost always busy but it's always worth the wait. Always. If you haven't gone... you're missing out."
4,"I had my doubts about Cream Stereo Lounge beacause I didn't like the name of the place and I heard that they played a lot of house and techno music. I've been sick of all the Scottsdale staples like Myst, Axis, SIX, PCL, etc.... so I thought I would give Cream a try and I ended up liking the place a lot. Everyone there was very friendly and the DJ played a lot of good songs to dance to. If you're sick of going to the same bars in Old Town give Cream a try."
1,"This place is worse than the IRS, at least the IRS admits when they made a mistake. But these arrogant workers will be caught dead before they hear themselves say ""sorry for the inconvenience"" or ""we made a mistake"".  They gave me different information on two consecutive visits that I made, then Dorrie, some lady who obviously should not have been working that day because she was coughing phlegm all over my documents, then after she asked me to wait by the counter for 10 minutes while their system updated.  I waited, 1 hour and 30 minutes later I finally went to the information counter and asked for Dorrie... I was told that she had gone to lunch 15 minutes ago and was told to go talk to another lady. She just dismissed me and I went to go talk to the new lady, who was also extremely rude and kept rolling her eyes and interrupting me before I could finish my sentences.  Basically i spent total of 3 and a half hours waiting and getting attitude and nothing was resolved because of their mis information and Dorries idiot customer service ethics and the last ladys pride..  not one person resolved anything and they all were too proud to say ""we apologize for the inconvenice"".  I recommend this place if you wanna be late to work 2 or more hours and having your mild mannered patience tested to the maximum."
5,Love this place. Everyone is fantastic. The girls up front can be spacey at times but their system is great and the email reminders are perfect.
3,"Some highlights - Loved the special of the day: red velvet pancakes breakfast with cream cheese topping. YUM YUM YUM - Corned beef hash is canned and not homemade :( sad face - Fried Chicken breakfast is a huge portion- tasted really well but definitely sad that they only have sausage gravy. Would love it if they could offer a non pork gravy for the non oink eaters.  Overall, it was delicious, simple menu, great service (Thanks to Waitress Kelly she was really nice) and would much rather support local eateries than Ihop or Denny's anyday."
5,"Best donuts in the valley. I like a variety of donuts (my favorites, though are raised sugar and raised glaze), and all the donuts here are great.  Never too heavy, always tasting fresh."
4,"I've only hiked Camelback once, but I felt so accomplished (albeit winded, and mere minutes away from passing out). We started the hike at 6 in the morning, and got to watch the sunrise while we made our way up the trail.  I thought it wasn't going to be a bad hike, but things get tougher about two-thirds up.  Things starting getting vertical at some points, and I wasn't really prepared for that. It was totally worth it once we got to the top, though - gorgeous, 360 view of the Phoenix metro area (and really, much more than that).  And watching the sunrise with someone special is pretty awesome too."
5,"What  a beautiful facility. Attention to detail is what this place is about and the army of workers each takes his / her portion of the details and does a mighty fine job. If you want a high end place to stay. This is a good choice. When I made my hotwire reservation and ended up here, I got the deal of the century! I am sure the rack rate is high, but if you want comfort and great facility. this would be a wonderful choice!  Oh yes, Everyone and I mean everyone was soooo nice. The gardeners,  the cleaning staff, the front desk, the parking attendant, all of them were super nice and fun and genuinely happy to be of service.."
5,One word: PISTACHIO... in all its glory... no need to say more.
4,"yummy! that's all i have to say about my blazin' buffalo sandwich on foccacia . the foccacia was a perfect specimen: light, appropriately herbed and airy. the sandwich fillings (sliced roast chicken, tomatoes, ranch, lettuce, and buffalo sauce) were fresh and yummy. i had a coupon for a free drink which made my sandwich, chips and a drink $7.47. a pretty awesome lunch for less than $8 makes me happy. almost as happy as buffalo sauce makes me. i have a tendency to be obsessed with buffalo sauce. a word to the wise: my co-workers got pasta salad and it looked awesome. they said it was tasty too. i was jealous. there's no up-charge for pasta salad - i recommend you get that instead of stupid chips you can get at the grocery."
2,Glorified panda express With that generalization aside I was willing to give ol PF Changs another try when they served me a steamed shanghai shrimp dish that was devoid of flavor Thinking less flavor meant a healthier meal I alas was given a shocking reminder of how this place sodium bombs there dishes when I read the nutritional info  'tear
5,"Eating in is a decent experience, but for delivery, I have yet to meet their match.  When I order delivery I always get a 16"" chicken pizza with alfredo sauce on top, and for the last 6 years I have received it in 30 minutes or less all but 2 times.  Its always tasty, fresh, and is my preeminent food for delivery, ever, period."
5,"We saw a small door with a sign over it and were intrigued, so we went inside - that's how we found Kazimierz.  Once our eyes adjusted (it's dark inside, like any good speakeasy), I loved the decor.  It's a wine bar with food that seems to be Egyptian flatbreads and then whatever the chef wants to make.  We were there on a Saturday, right in the middle of happy hour, and enjoyed a ridiculous evening of items that were mostly $8.  Wine flights, flatbreads, certain bottles of wine = $8.  BOTTLES OF WINE.  I'm sure they were just cleaning out old inventory, since they have hundreds of listings, but for these two wines, until they ran out of bottles, the bottles were $8.   We had the Northern Territory flatbread (pancetta, yukon gold potatoes, rosemary, crème fraîche and smoked gouda). Yum. We also had an open faced sandwich made with smoked pork belly, apple butter and melted cheese with sweet potato chips on the side.  IT WAS $7.  Between the $8 bottle of wine and that, I felt like I was stealing from these people.  The bartenders were great, as so was the music.  I will, without question, be going back."
4,"Been wanting to try this place out for some time and finally had the opportunity today.  I didn't expect much of a crowd on a Friday morning, however when we pulled in I was shocked to see about 10 people waiting outside.  Typical for a weekend morning breakfast joint.....but a weekday?  This place must be good.  Suprisingly, the wait was short...they obviously know how to handle a crowd at this place.  Once inside, I was impressed.  Pretty small, but we had plenty of room in our booth.  I ordered the eggs and sausage, which came with toast and potatoes. The food came out quick.  The thing that really set it apart was the meat.... this was no Jimmy Dean.  It was worthy of Abe Frohman, Sausage King of Chicago.  Needless to say, I'm looking forward to going back and trying some more items on the menu."
1,"Music was loud as shit.  The food, Jesus Christ the food.  Lame ass chips and salsa.  No joke, like 8 chips were on the plate.  Salsa was probably one of the worst I've had, no flavor at all and warm.   Salads come out warm (I'm assuming this is why I've been puking).  Gross right, warm lettuce.  Waiter let's us know they can make daughter a little quesadilla (cheese only) which comes out so greasy.  Our taco plates come out 10 minutes later.  2 dinky tacos on each plate that are flavorless and luke warm at best.  Yes, they are spicey, no that does not mean they are flavorful.  I'm literally using my cell phone to see what was on the plate it's so dark.  Mint water was warm.  Gross and not refreshing whatsoever.  My daughter's quesadilla was $13, yes for 2 tortillas smaller than my hand and some 'cheese'.  I get it- make a dollar, but damn, don't rip your customers off.  So over the top lame.  Neither my husband nor myself finished.   Meal was $46.  Horrible.  Health department should go temp that place- I'm not sure the refrigeration is working properly.  Such a disappointment, I've been a vegetarian for 18 years- was looking forward to a new spot.  Won't be returning.  Ever."
4,"They built a Sauce in Minneapolis & it only lasted three months. I'll never understand why, but I'm excited they are in Arizona & plenty of them.  The Turkey & Feta salad is almost identical to my favorite at True Food Kitchen, which is a great thing. The paninis I've tried have always been good & come with a side of seasoned chips. I've never tried any of the pastas, but they all look wonderful as well. Great place for a quick, affordable, good meal."
5,"I was extremely happy that we chose Cool Cuts 4 Kids for my son's first big boy hair cut. He was instantly comfortable and drawn in by all of the friendly things they have for children. He was given the choice of a movie or playing a video game, of course knowing exactly what he wants went straight for the video game (Sonic on XBOX). It was pretty much a breeze from that point the little guy was hypnotized and didn't even realize what was going on w/ his beautiful, lovely long hair =( obviously they need to focus on distracting the mom's lol! Jessie who cut my sons long hair was a doll, she didn't seem to be bothered by the mother breathing down her neck as she hacked off my little's hair or the boyfriend taking a copious amount of pictures and video of the whole event. In the end my son looked great and I was a happy mama, I couldn't have asked for a better experience."
4,"Suede has been around for awhile now. It's no spring chicken. But I still find the place to be a good time, if you can stand the wall-to-wall people and the loooong lines for the bathroom (only the ladies bathroom, of course).  I think the drink prices are normal for a Scottsdale bar and they aren't any higher or lower than what you'll find at Myst, Axis/Radius or Six...strange, don't they all have the same owner??  It's a fun spot to go though and even if you're not feeling it, you can walk right over to Axis or Pussycat and not take much time out of your night to do it since they're right across the street. If it's a good night, Suede plays the best hip hop and rap music to dance to and the floor will be packed.  On a bad night, the DJ is spinning techno crap (I'm not a fan) and my friends and I will go somewhere else for the night.  There is never a cover for girls, although I think there is always one for guys on Friday and Saturday nights.  Guys have to dress up a little too...I think Suede follows the no hat rule and the bouncer may take a look at your shoes too- guys can't wear sandals or sneakers (I think!) So definitely call and get their updated dress code before you head out."
5,this place is amazing!  So many flavors to choose from!!!!  I LOVE this place!!!!
3,"I can understand why everyone loves this place-- who wouldn't, right? With so many choices of cool, creamy gelato? Well, unless I am just very unlucky and visited on a bad day, this Gelato Spot has gone steeply downhill. My husband ordered a strawberry-kiwi flavored and I chocolate peanut butter. We both agreed: the gelato tasted grainy, with noticable ice crystals. And worse, the flavorings tasted like they came from a bottle, not fresh. IMO, this has become more of a place to see-and-be-seen -- not savor good gelato!"
5,This location has closed.  Went by today and found an empty restaurant.
2,"I'll be honest--this place is good for Americans... but not good enough for Chinese people.  The waiters were sort of rude to us, despite our being able to speak their language. Furthermore.. what kind of authentic Chinese restaurant serves dinner out of plates? Blasphemy! Our table to had to go out of our way to get bowls! I'm surprised they had chopsticks. Otherwise, their mock  food was salty and pasty, perfect for Americans in search of a good Orange Chicken replacement.  Wait.. salty and pasty? It's supposed to be a (insert meat type) dish, consisting of subtle flavors and intense chili pepper action. Neeext..."
4,"I love this place!  Great quality food, great service, large portions and fare prices.  In the Fry's parking lot.  Try the bbq pork egg foo young, mongolian beef and get the lo mein instead of rice.  Good stuff."
4,"I like Pei Wei, its good when I want something fast. But the main reason for my review on here today was to say HOW AMAZING the manager was at this location.  I came in at lunch and it was VERY busy. There was a line to the door. There were some arguments about someone stealing a seat (unhappy customer, complaining because a seat was saved and they had waited in line, wanted to be comped because of it.... so dumb if you ask me. I mean just deal with it people! Its busy!) But the manager dealt with it so professionally, and when I was next in line he did not act rushed, he was very helpful, and told me that if I did not like what I ordered to just tell him and he would get me something new. I work in the restaurant business (a much higher priced place) and this manager was awesome! Good job man!"
5,I used Full Circle Auto Body after my daughter's car was in an accident. They were very knowledgable and helpful about insurance issues and got the car repaired quickly. They post progress of your vehicle with photos on their website which is so cool. I'll definitely use them again if the occassion arises.
2,"Margaritas were good, tacos were fair (small), guacamole was wonderful. after ten it gets really loud here. They need to have tequila flights."
1,"I was really excited about this event, maybe my expectations were too high, because I was really underwhelmed.  Very little shade, ran out of water, by the time I got there at 1pm (other obligations) 20% of the vendors were out of food, and by the time I ate my way through some, everyone else was already out.   60 bucks for that?  I don't think so.   And when I mentioned it to ""the person in charge"", he was patronizing, invalidating and kept telling me how happy the chefs were.  Well, I'm your consumer, big guy.   Sorry, Devoured, wish it could have been better.  What food I did try, was pretty good."
4,"This is one of my favorites stores to head to when I need the motivation that comes from new triathlon clothing and accessories. The staff is knowledgeable and helpful, without being intimidating.   They have a decent selection of women's items that are high quality and come with a high price - so I normally head there when I'm looking for race wear/accessories and go elsewhere for regular workout clothes.   They do have some sale items, and recently I found some great Pearl Izumi tri shorts for half off - woo hoo! It's great to have stores like this geared towards triathlons!"
4,"Great white sangria and margaritas!!!  We went for dinner, but ended up ordering appetizers and a pitcher of white sangria. All I can say is the service was great but the drinks are amazing!!!  The tortilla chips  were fresh and homemade.  The ceviche was so tasteful!"
4,"Food is top notch and within a good price range for a weekend breakfast.  I dropped a star because it's always so crowded there's usually a line to order your food.  That and they're closed on Sundays.  It's a perfect weekend breakfast, how can you be closed on Sundays?!  But I eat here all the time."
4,"Whenever you want a refreshing drink, go to Tea Infusion.  (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral) + Comfy tables and chairs.  It's a bit like a coffee joint, a place to sit, relax, and talk with friends. + The tea selection is AMAZING.  I don't drink too much tea myself, but I know my friends like it.  They have fresh tea in boxes and have a very large assortment. + You can do so much to your drink.  Blend, ice, hot, boba.  I like to get smoothies (they also put green tea in their smoothies) with boba.  It's delicious. - Location.  A place like this should NOT be sandwiched between stores in a crappy mall.  It would be better in a shopping center, away from Tempe Marketplace. -/+ Food is alright.  If you're looking for a snack, good, but if you're looking for a decent sands"
5,"I'm on a community social action committee and have spent the last year planning a community-wide service day. We were each responsible to lead a team of volunteers in a different community service project and per my passion I chose the Humane Society. We arrived on Sunday afternoon with a group of 12 people at the Campus for Compassion on Dobbins Rd. Kathy - the head of volunteer services - met with us and gave us a thorough introduction. She included the history of the AZ humane society and the process and procedures by which they take-in and shelter animals. She really focused on promoting spaying and neutering pets and cited some very impressive statistics. Did you know that over 7 years un-neutered  cats can breed to reach 420,000 in numbers??!!!! and dogs 67,000??!!! thats CRAZY and so compelling.  Kathy proceeded by giving us a very educational tour of the facilities... we saw dogs, horses, cats and bunnies. It was very eye-opening. First off it shattered any stigma you have about a shelter. The animal accommodations are so impressive!! The dogs have BIG size kennels with indoor and outdoor spaces that are really spacious. I was nervous to go in and see the dogs in kennels but I really wasn't as heartbroken as I thought I'd be bc they really had nice size spaces.  There are sprawling lawns in the back where animals can run and play which even include a public dog park! There are also private puppy rooms.  The cats have big crates as well and even private bedrooms where they can hang out in groups and the facilities were squeaky clean w/o any odors.  The volunteers were so nice, kind and devoted to the animals. We got to feed horses, play with cats and bunnies and put together leashes for dogs. The most encouraging thing though was that the place was busy on a sunday! buzzing with people wanting to adopt pets and several cats were actually adopted during the 2 hours we were there. It was a wonderful and meaningful experience and I encourage anyone who is looking for a pet to adopt from the Humane Society and to look into volunteering with them"
3,"Bad service, great food, awful coffee."
2,"For what it is, cheap easy family friendly food with a bit of a yuppie bend, its not bad. But they messed up a grilled cheese sandwich. How do you do that? My mom, god bless her, can't cook to save her life. None the less, she can still make a pretty damn good grilled cheese. Its not rocket science. Let me walk Sauce through this: - Cut slices of cheese. Precut is pretty gross. - Put bread around cheese. - Apply butter to the outside. - Grill til melted. Yet, my girlfriend's grilled cheese was horrible. Bad bread, thin on the cheese, and it tasted like heated cat turds. I'm just not that impressed. I know lots of you love this place, but I don't for the life of me know why. It would have been 1 star, but the mac n' cheese bought it an extra star.  Why is it so hard to find good pizza in Phoenix. You'd think with its mob proximity to Las Vegas that it'd have better Italian food. And yet, not so much. I blame the Mormon influence on this town. Too many years of Kraft products and special underwear have really killed the food talent here."
4,"Jamba is definitely as good as it gets when it comes to chain smoothie places. We are big fans of the Acai antioxidant smoothie, which is unlike the other smoothies that we've tried there. It is super healthy and has a distinct flavor to it which we like because it's not as sweet as their traditional smoothies are. I like going to Jamba because they are always reliable, fast and friendly when we have visited, even if the smoothies are a tad pricey. But, you get what you pay for, and I would much rather pay a little extra for a consistently good smoothie that I know will be delicious than take my chances on an unknown place that most likely won't deliver the goods."
4,"Oh Orange Table, what can I say about you? I am, to say the least, a regular here. Completely by default, of course, given that I work directly over this great little coffee shop.  The food here: amazing. The coffee: the best. The atmosphere: perfect. So why only four stars? Because the service can be absolutely abysmal at times. Given, there are a few star performers here who give it their all, bust their ass, and never forget a customer's name. And Sue, the owner, really seems to genuinely care about each and every person that walks in the door. But the service is so unwaveringly slow that I am often prevented from eating here due to time constraints. Example: I once ordered a cup of soup to go-- soup, mind you, that is completely ready and cooked, just sitting in a big tureen in the back-- and it took 35 minutes.  So, yes, the food is amazingly fresh, inventive, delectable. The prosciutto is shipped in from Italy. The bread is natural and baked locally. The chef's in the kitchen are mad geniuses, whipping up sandwiches, salads, appetizers, all completely fresh and filling. But you absolutely must have the time to wait for it. I've never had anything I didn't like!"
4,"The parking lot is too small so watch out for your car doors.  The seafood is about as authentic as it gets in the US. Arizonans cook their seafood like New Yorkers cook their steaks: rare = medium, and medium = shriveled. Still, the shrimp & octopus cocktail was tender & plump. The peppers stuffed with shrimp were savory. The rice was not sticky and the refried beans didn't taste like they had lard. But I didn't ask. I would do this again, but next time I'll bring a friend. It's a very social place, 4 girlfriends chatted it up before, during and after I left."
4,"We came here because we figured it wouldn't be busy; we were right.  But, to our amazement, the food was really good. I had an extremely flavorful cheeseburger that was as good as any burger I have had in Phoenix.  Thankfully, herd instinct will keep the masses flocking to lesser establishments like Lenny's, In-N-Out and Lucky Boyz so we can have Village Inn practically to ourselves."
5,"I almost NEVER give a chain restaurant a 5-star review, not because I'm opposed to the idea but because very few are worthy. But Bandera is just that good, from the upscale casual, relaxed and inviting atmosphere to the excellent service to the delicious food. Ordering the cornbread to start is a must - it'd be a crime not to. The grilled artichoke and queso/guacamole apps are also wonderful. I had the macho salad, which was quite large and packed with good stuff. I also had a side of the mac and cheese that was outrageously good. Dessert offerings are limited to two choices, and neither blew me away, but the Oreo one was the better of the two. Bandera is, like its sister restaurant Houstons, always a wonderful experience with reliably terrific food."
5,"My boyfriend and I stopped by to grab a bite to eat before work and long story short -Greeted immediately  -Lots of variety -Meat lovers pizza is amazing -Ask for Tawnya she's really nice and a wonderful server  -Will be back, loved the excellent service!!"
4,I've been to Joe's & Bobby Q's but Dave's takes the BBQ on this one! We got Dave's family portions for one of our many tailgating experiences. We tried all of there dishes and the beef brisket was delicious as was the pulled pork. And don't forget the cornbread muffins. While this is a place you cannot go often or you will be the pig! Its worth the calories every now and then!!
4,This store is 2 miles from my house so I am there all the time. I find their customer service has been consistently good. Even on Black Friday at 7am the sales help has been very pleasant and very helpful.
5,I can't believe no one has talked about Pasta Tuesday. Definitely the best time to go but make sure you get there early because the pasta literally runs out. It is that good. They have this guy (Guido) come every Tuesday and he starts making hand made pasta early in the morning. He picks 2 unique dishes. It was one of the best pasta I have EVER tasted. I crave it all the time. I had a fettucini noodle in a alfredo creme sauce with herbs and pine nuts on top. I can't even describe the taste (wow what a good food critic i am). You just have to go check it out. I am going TONIGHT!
5,This place is heavenly!!! I have dreams about it on a regular basis. The cookies are so fresh and you can choose two different kinds and two different ice cream flavors. TASTY!
3,"This bar reminds of an old pair of pants. It fits. Not too tight, not perfect. Just kind of fits. There's some holes in the knees, and its a bit faded. It's certainly not perfect. Mulligans is that bar where you can go and kick it with your friends. You never know what kind of people you are going to run into. Co-workers, drunkards, bottle rats who got kicked out from other places. The drinks are cheap. The beer selection is so so. The bartenders are pretty nice, but aloof. It's just an average bar though. Nothing great, nothing bad."
5,I've been coming here since the 70's when it was across the street and had a screen door. I know the staff and the daily specials by heart.  When I lived away from PHX it was the place I wished for. When I go to NYC I have to take RM food to my friends. The whole family agrees. I don't understand the negative reviews. The reviewers must have had a bad day. I love the food and so has everyone  I know.
4,There is a Leinenkugel beer stand on the east side of the first floor heading toward Fatburger! SO so so excited to discover that! They only take cash though!
4,"Since I was in AZ area for the weekend with my gf for pleasure we decided to visit one of my friends in the area. She picked this place and we decided to get seafood instead of steak or a meat house.  First of all, I'd suggest making reservations otherwise DO NOT COME HERE. We showed up at 7pm but weren't seated until 845. Good thing we ate a really good lunch otherwise I'd be starving and complaining like a baby. At least this gave us time to have a few drinks before dinner in the LARGE outdoor waiting patio area. I think it was so crowded because it was the weekend before Fat Tuesday. This place kinda reminds me of Bubba Gump or something similar. It seems fun and they do have a large bar and waiting area.  We ordered alligator and frog legs as an appetizer. LOVED IT!!! We wanted the fried alligator and frog legs but the waiter absolutely loved that he worked here and HIGHLY recommended that we order it grilled instead. Since he worked here, we figured why not? I was thinking to myself that the cooks were a bit lazy and maybe they didn't want to prepare it. Lol. To my surprise, it was good as he mentioned. I have had both before but not for a few years so I was pleased. My gf ordered the crab stuffed shrimp which was really good. I ordered a  combination seafood plate which was good but not great.  There are way too many things to order on the menu. A lot of fried food so if you are trying to watch your diet/weight then don't come here.  I would definitely come here again but I wouldn't be in any rush. Great for a lot of people and groups, but PLEASE make RESERVATIONS."
5,"Imagine for a minute that you're waiting in a really long line. No, it's not the line ride. You see a menu on the wall with your ordering options, but before you are anywhere near someone that could take your order, you're yelled at. ""Hey! What do you want?"" Don't be afraid, but don't be surprised either. Keep your cool and order your dogs. Immediately start thinking about if you want fries or rings (onion rings) and be prepared for when you're called upon again. Then watch as your hot dog is mutilated in front of your eyes and what appears on your tray is what looks like a hot mess of decapitated food. Never fear though... because it is amazing. Well worth the wait and one of the best dogs you'll ever have. My favorites here are the white hot and the bratwurst. Whenever I know I'm going, I end up salivating like Pavlov's dog for hours. The booths are classic hot dog stand style and the pennants lined up along the top of the walls are fantastic to look at. One started a whole conversation and research one day about a basketball team we knew nothing about."
4,"The pho was good and a generous portion, but compared to most Vietnamese places... way over priced. The owner is very nice and entertaining :) The spring rolls were decent, but smaller than most places for the price. It still beats anything in the west valley."
1,"I'll be charitable - this place sucks! I went there because a friend had *exactly* the piece of furniture I needed and he got his from Ikea.   After wandering around the store forever, I finally found the right department. The people working there were cold. uncaring. not helpful. no concept of customer service.  I left in disgust! Couple of days later, I was in Cost Plus World Market @ 18th St. & Camelback.  Voila!  I fould what I wanted - for close to the same price.  the BIG difference:  Warm smiles, friendly people, volunteered to go out of their way to help me.  Felt like I was among long-time friends!  They even delivered when they said they would. And, no need to drive half way to tucson and back! Ikea?  Don't be foolish.  Cost Plus?  Now, there's a place that earned my repeat business!"
5,"I love my eye doctor!  Platonically, of course.  The entire staff is relaxed, friendly, easy going, and personable.  No one ever makes you feel rushed but instead take time to make sure that everything is okay, that you've thought of everything, gotten all of your questions answered, and had plenty of time to make decisions and think.  The doctor takes time to get to know you and to talk about how you use your eyes (staring at the computer, sports, etc).  The assistants try to think of things from your point of view so they can volunteer useful information and ask a lot of specific questions while doing so.  This place treats you like family.  There's a broad range of styles, but mostly, they're fashionable frames.  When I go in, I see a lot of kids, young adults, and 20 and 30-somethings as well as the older patients who so often come to need glasses.  Horwitz costs a little more than the mall chains, but my prescriptions have been consistently better thanks to the doctor taking time, the lenses are much higher quality, and the frames are worlds better in terms of availability of things that aren't ugly and durability."
5,"The PERFECT Breakfast :)  If only I could have this every day :) Matt's is all you want a breakfast spot to be...cute, friendly and the most amazing food out there. I highly recommend the hog and chick.  You just can't go wrong with eggs*, bacon*, home fries* (get the home fries, not the hashbrowns) and their toast* served with Terra Verde Farms preserves.  * = best ever, ever, ever I could write on and on...you've seen the reviews.  Just make sure to make it there, you won't be sorry, you'll be addicted!"
5,"Great little hole in the wall with authentic New Mexican food.  Chili Relleno was awesome, and the red and green chile was flavorful and spicy.  Rice and beans were good and the sopapilla was delicious. Atmosphere was cozy.  If you want real red and green chile vs. sauce this is the place."
4,"This place is great if you are looking for something sweet and are in Scottsdale. I had the tin roof sundae and it was out of this world. I love sweet and salty together. Sugar Bowl is also open late so its a great place to go if you are hungry or drunk or have the muchies and need something good to eat. The service, however, is a little slow and I would never dream of going during normal hours (I have been late at night) with the amount of kids that are probably there!"
5,"I moved from Philly this past summer and I've searched all over the Valley for a ""GOOD"" Pizza. After eating lots of tasteless and cardboard pizza, I found Momma Mia when I moved into Arcadia! I love the hole in the wall vibe! Just like home :) The sauce is great and super tasty! The dough tastes slightly sweet and is fluffy..It's what makes the pizza so great and there is a brickoven!! I love it! My husband and I order the pizza/wing special .The wings are so hot and spicy ( we order the hot, but it comes in buffalo and mild) They have an extensive menu of pasta, sandwiches and salads. I want to try their Philly Steak next, but for the time being I still make mine at home.  Every pizza place likes to say its ""New York Style"", but this place really does a NYC pizza. Well the best nyc pizza you're gonna get in AZ, Something about the water."
2,"I always hate giving bad reviews, but our service left quite a bit to be desired. I can normally dismiss such things, but it became evident that our bad service was not a fluke. We arrived around 10:00 and was told that food would only be served until 11. That wouldn't be a problem at all except that our waitress didn't return with menus until close to 10:30 and then returned to take our orders at only a few minutes before 11. The place had other patrons, but it certainly wasn't so busy as to take an hour to get our orders. Unfortunately, on each of our visits, the waitress was half listening and seemed easily confused The food itself was quite good. The Shepherd's pie was hot and tasty and the bloody marys were actually perfectly spiced. Neither was worth getting excited about, but they were certainly decent and reasonably priced.  Considerably later in the evening, our waitress returned with the bill. There was one extra drink on the bill which no one ordered and she was perfectly friendly about saying she'd remove it, but we spent a good five minutes as she kept getting confused about our - apparently - very complicated instructions of ""$20 on the credit card. The rest in cash"" She continually read back excessively complex scenarios, and we kept asking her simply to put twenty on the card, that's all. When she returned, she had taken $20 of our cash towards the bill, charged $60 to the card and kept the remaining $55 in cash as a tip. That's just shy of a 75% tip she assigned herself.  We spoke to the manager, who couldn't find her for some time, and when she showed up, she blamed us repeatedly. She finally refunded the card and brought us our new bill, with the extra drink. It wasn't worth arguing about at that point. The sad part is that everyone at my table, and our surrounding tables started telling similar tales from past visits. I guess this kind of service is not uncommon."
4,Like I said with a double double you never go wrong
2,"Walgreen's has the best nuts. However, they recently changed their prices and only give a cheaper, 2-for on the halves and pieces. And they upped the price (again) on the whole cashews.  I will be shopping elsewhere."
3,"Thank you, Mobile Yelp App!  Without you, I would have been stuck in Phoenix with no idea of where to find Thai food for lunch that was near a Light Rail station in Tempe! I arrived at Thai Rama about 11:15 AM.  On entering, there was no indication of waiting to be served and no one visible from the staff, so I selected a table and sat down.  My waitress came to the table and asked if I would be more comfortable at a 2-seat table instead of the 4-seat table I had selected.  Since there were about 25 available tables of various size, I declined and told her I was comfortable where I sat.  There were 3 other tables active in the restaurant, so I did not anticipate the restaurant needing my 4-top before I was done. The waitress set the lunch specials menu on the table and went to get a glass of water.  The lunch specials menu had 10 options available, but no Som Tom.  I asked the waitress if Som Tom was available and she answered that she did not know what Som Tom was.  She reached for a full menu as I explained that Som Tom is green papaya salad.  She handed me the menu and directed me to the third page for salads.  There, first on the list, Som Tom. I ordered Som Tom, the yardstick by which I measure every Thai restaurant, 10 spicy (5 makes my nose run, 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes), leaving off the green beans and shrimp, and jasmine rice.  Waitress asked if I wanted anything else to drink, but I said I would stick with water. Ambience here is pretty plain...and the paper napkins are not of the highest quality.  The decor reminded me of a formula-type restaurant like an Applebees or Chili's...with a hispanic flair.  I observed the chef as he came out of the kitchen and made a loop around the dining room.  As he walked by, I asked in Thai how he was doing.  He stopped and replied that the day was starting off slow, but that it would be busy soon enough.  Then, he continued back on to the kitchen after wishing me a good day. About 5 minutes later, my papaya salad was brought to the table.  Portion size was nice, about 2 1/4 cups.  I took a taste and evaluated a 5 spicy.  When the waitress came to ask if I needed anything, I asked for more chili and lime.  She returned quickly with red chili pepper and sliced lime.  I doctored up the order and fell to with a gusto.  For the price, adequate.   Jasmine rice was about a cup, and not too sticky.  The waitress was good about keeping my water glass full...and in Phoenix, that is important! On completing my lunch, I sat and waited for the waitress to bring my bill.  I saw no one for about 10 minutes, then the chef came out of the kitchen and made another round of the dining room.  He asked me (in English) if I enjoyed my salad.  I answered in Thai that it was not spicy enough, and I was surprised he was using red chili instead of Thai chili.  He chuckled and replied that Thai chili was a little more expensive.  I asked for my check and he said he would send the waitress out. For the convenience, outstanding!  For the next experience, I will be sure the chef sees me before I place my order.  For the wait on the bill, a little too long."
4,"Creamy, luscious, divine...just some of the words that barely describe the wonderfulness that is Ritter's frozen custard.  Short of having real Italian gelato (never been to Italy yet, so I can't even begin to compare the schtuff we have here), this frozen custard beats everything this side of town. Mix-ins, schmixins.  The custard's yummy with or without.  It's more flavorful than teeth loosening sweet and they have over 65 to choose from...although they rotate around about 6 of them per day. It sure makes the moody blues go bye-bye with each spoonful.  Okay, I'm being a little over-dramatic.  But it really is good! Price is right, service is great, and it would take a long time before you became bored with the flavors.  You could literally go every day and try something new.  Bad for hips, good for the little kid in all of us."
4,"This review is slightly bias, seeing that I was in the press box. This park is very nice. Has ample parking and a ton of restaurants in the area for before or after the games. The food in the stadium is typical overpriced stadium food. I had the chicken teriyaki bowl for $7. The vendors are comical (you will hear the lemonade guy from across the stadium). I'd definitely see another game here in the future."
4,"I've been here a few times. I love that it's vegetarian friendly! I think I've ordered every vegetarian option they have, the most recent being  the Veggie Cole Turkey. I think it might be my favorite. The mock turkey they use is divine and the coleslaw & Russian dressing are so tasty!  The staff is always super friendly and the service is always quick. Prices are a little higher than what you'd pay at any other chain sub shop, but that's not really a con to the place. The quality of the ingredients make it worth the price. And you get a lot for what you pay for. A small is more than filling!  A few things I wish they would change is the fact that they use so much paper to wrap their sandwiches. It's quite wasteful and I feel like my small sandwich wrap paper takes up the entire table. Also, I really wish they would have a Veggie Bobby on the menu! I'm sure many vegetarians who eat there probably feel the same way."
5,"When I met some friends for dinner at this restaurant at the end of October, I liked it so much that I made a mental note to write something later.   I've just signed onto Yelp, and this is my first review. Our group of friends hadn't seen each other for a while.   Busy catching up, we didn't open our menus for quite a while.  I was impressed that our waitress (her name might be Mel) kept coming back in the nicest way to check on us, but didn't interrupt our conversation.   She kept letting us know that she was ready when we were.   When we were finally ready to order, she asked:  ""Separate checks?""   Terrific.  That was exactly what we needed. I hadn't expected to like the food, because I had heard and read that it was all the  high-calorie ""comfort"" variety.   It was a nice surprise that I was able to get low-calorie substitutions for the sides that went with my entree. Overall, it was a very nice experience."
4,"Great early bird specials on wine and mini-pitchers of beer before 5pm, only $5.  The food is very good and taylored to a wine menu.  A very nice place for a date with your wife or significant other."
4,"Went to Sticklers for the first time today, with a friend who works across the street.  I'm a little leary of places that get talked up so much, but Sticklers was everything she talked about and more.   A family friend once told me that the way to tell a good restaurant is how busy it is.  Seems like common sense now, but how many times have you walked into a restaurant with less than 10 people in the whole place and then walked away disappointed? Well Sticklers was packed.  My first impression was ""Crap, the line is 20 people deep and we only have 40 minutes for lunch...there's no way""!  Well I was pleasantly surprised when we got through the entire line, food in hand, in about 5!  The guys and gals that work there are efficient and have it down.  And they showed some great patience for a newbie. The chicken salad and provolone sandwich was outstanding and the hot peppers gave it a great kick.  Word of warning to the lactose intolerant - it's a 2-piller!  The atmosphere was active and lively but not overly loud.  We were still able to have a conversation without shouting.  I just wished the people at the next table realized that.  We didn't need to hear about their daughter ""wrongly"" accused of DUI...for the third time!"
4,"It was a busy bustling little town perched atop a small hill between the mighty Superstition Mountains to the east and the Goldfield Mountains to the west.    The first gold-strike was made in 1892, and it took just a little under a year before the town came to life. One rich strike after another supported the town and approximately 4000 people who lived in the district for five rich years.    The town boasted 3 saloons, a boarding house, general store, blacksmith shop, brewery, meat market and a school house. Just when it looked like the town would outgrow Mesa, the vein faulted, the grade of ore dropped and the town died a slow painful death. After several unsuccessful attempts to reopen the mines, the town did come to life again from 1910 on and off until 1926."
1,"The 3 employees were so busy talking to each other they couldn't remember what we ordered, kept having to ask, and still didn't get it right.  In the midst of the three employees continuing in their personal chaos, my husband finally said, ""ok, time out! I'm the customer.  Make our sandwiches and then take care of your issues."". They stopped for a split second, all three looked at us, then they actually IGNORED us, finished their conversation, then finished our sandwiches.  We were the only ones in there and we really were shocked!  Good thing I like avacado, because it ended up on my sandwich & I didn't order it, and after telling the girl, she said, ""I thought you said..."". Still had the order wrong!  Whew!"
4,It's like Paradise Bakery but with a more diverse and far better menu.
5,"A friend of a friend was telling us about this place on Sunday morning, and how awesome their pizza is.  It sounded awesome, but he warned us the line is usually an hour and a half long.  Oh well, we went anyway.  Luckily, we were early enough where we didn't have to wait long for a table.  When we were leaving, though, the line was easily an hour long. We started with the wings, which come in an order of 14 and were delicious.  Five of us were dining there, so we ordered two small pizzas, with each one being a half, so we had a nice variety of pizzas to try from.  We got the BBQ Chicken, the Frisco, Grandma G's, and one more that eludes me now.  All were pretty delicious, and I give them mad props for going out of their way to create unique pizzas with untraditional toppings (Grandma G's had potato on it).  Our entire bill with a few drinks came to under $80. Oh, make sure you sit outside... the inside had a lot of loud kids, and it seemed to echo off each wall and annoy the hell out of our party.  The women in our party also said the air temperature kept changing in there.  Keep in mind, too, that they don't have a full bar, so if you're going there hoping to start off with a bloody mary, you're out of luck."
5,"Let me start by saying that I love tacos. I eat lots of tacos. When I get hungry one of the first things to cross my mind is tacos. That said, I love El Nopalito for their tacos. I'm pretty picky about my tacos. I don't really like dumb-ass flour tortillas, dry tacos, unseasoned meat in a taco, taco bell is not tacos, the list goes on. I prefer authentic Mexican street tacos. That being said, El Nopalito is the one place in town I feel like I am getting the most authentic street taco that I have been able to find in Phoenix. The only reason I am not here more often is the commute is a bit much as I live in the East Valley.  However, if I am anywhere near the area it is almost mandatory to stop and have at least a taco or two. I recommend trying all of the tacos though my favourite has to be the cabeza (it sounds creepy but is buttery and delicious). It does help if you speak Spanish as it will make ordering and asking any questions you may have easier."
5,Great variety.  Great price!  Beats other buffets in the East Valley.
5,"Bike cabs beware! You've got nothing on this rig!  Tour de Tavern is a tribute to tipsy teamwork and a perfect way to host a unique group event. As ""pedalers"" on their inaugural tour, we enjoyed the celebrity treatment of cruising down the winding streets of Old Town Scottsdale as onlookers snapped photos and cheered us on! We rocked out to top 40 hits and, by special request, our Lonely Island favorites on their awesome sound system. Our guides were flexible and let our party run the show. If we needed more time for let's say...... an impromptu horseback ride in front of Shotgun Betty's, they were more than happy to wait.  As an added bonus everyone gets to burn off some of those unwanted cocktail calories in between your favorite watering holes. If you are concerned that after a few stops (and a few shots) your legs might lose some of that forward momentum, there are a few coveted ""non pedaling"" seats in the back of the bike. We all compromised with a friendly and fair rotation system.  Our tour guides were helpful, accommodating, and entertaining. They even proved to be exceedingly patient upon discovering that we did in facts have ""that guy"" in our group.  If you're saying to yourself,  ""Such a marvelous experience could only cost an arm and least the majority of a leg"" then you would be wrong! With the cost of gas being substituted for sheer earth friendly man power, our group of fifteen people spent less than $30 bucks each for the experience. But wait, there's more! Included in this price are all the amazing special deals that Tour de Tavern exclusively brings you at select bars along the route. On our tour we were offered drinks specials ranging from $3 to ONE PENNY!  I say this in all caps because it's ONE PENNY! So next time you are planning an event, I recommend Tour de Tavern 100%! ""Look Ma! No hands!"""
5,Harvest hash is incredible - ask for their house made BBQ sauce on the side.  Vegan raspberry banana bread French toast!!!  Sooooo good! It's a busy place on a Saturday morning but they work fast and everything runs smoothly. A gem!!!
2,"Food was pretty good but my biggest issue was with the service. We made a reservation and still had to wait an hour. Isn't the whole point of a reservation...so you don't have to wait an hour? One of the three hostess, tried to help at the end of the wait but by then all we waited was to eat/drink. All in all, I enjoyed my chicken and bbq ribs but would not go back."
3,"Its been a few weeks since I've eaten here..but its only now that I have time to write this long, overdue review. Hm...its upscale...kind of comparable to Mikuni's in Sac...but their menu is to some extent, smaller and less tasty.  I don't recall exactly what i ordered but...I wouldn't recommend this place to friends.  It was okay, nothing that stood out...and trust me, food, when its good...it sticks with me.  :)   Without further a due, edible but i would never crave for it again."
4,"Drove into Phoenix today and headed straight to Mrs. White's.  It seems we were a bit early, and we had to wait outside while it opened.  An employee came outside while we were waiting to grab a smoke.  He was friendly and started up a bit of conversation with my husband about the place.  It turns out he was one of the cooks. When were able to finally get in, we were offered drinks, and ended up getting sweet tea, which I don't care for.  I got the smothered pork chop and two sides, the mac and cheese and the black eyed peas.   We got a corn cake to eat while we waited and when the meal came it was pipping hot and very good. Service was excellent and prices were reasonable.  I recommend this place for some true southern food."
4,"I have been to this Mojo fro yo location several times now and really enjoy their yogurts! The yogurt tastes great, is light and refreshing and somewhat healthy if you avoid all of the chocolately/candy toppings yet they offer tons of fruit options. Priced by weight, a great stop after retail therapy at Saks or dessert after Stingray Sushi or True Food at the Biltmore. A must try, plus they have punch cards for free fro yo after a couple of visits! :)"
3,"In the office, Fiesta Burrito is aptly known as ""across the street.""  Kind of like, ""How about across the street?""  ""Yeah, I could do across the street, today.""  If I ever said, ""How about Fiesta Burrito?""  I would get, ""Where's that?""  Then I would have to say, ""You know, across the street.""  And the response would be, ""Well, why didn't you say so in the first place."" The primary reason we eat at ""across the street"" is because it is convenient - it's across the street.  And in the immortal words of my most quotable co-worker, ""It is fast, cheap, and good -- no questions asked.""  The part about it being good is debatable.  I could do with a little less greasy.  Fast, no question.  And despite that fact that ""across the street"" charges 60 cents for spicy carrots now, the prices are low.  I like the chorizo plate with a side of sour cream, although I might start branching out as we eat at ""across the street"" way too much, and I'm getting tired of always having the same thing. At just above a dive, I would call it a hole in the wall, but really, it is just a generic Mexican joint that hides in plain sight.  Even the name is rather plain as no one can seem to remember it.  There is a smallish, generic inside dining area, which is accompanied by a small, generic patio for outside dining.  Some high school students seem to come by for lunch leave.  The staff is polite.  Until they move or I no longer work across the street, I'll be a regular."
2,I wasn't aware the hamburgers came with two patties until I bit into the large fatty food eating competition mess of a burger. It was good but my arteries screamed at me for the rest of the day. The fries were ok. I opted for the cajun fries which were a bit soggy.  The place it diner-esque. Music bumpin' and the coke machines are all high tech and fun to use.  I don't plan on putting this place in my rotation of burger joints but I'm glad I tried it to see what all the hype was. Hype is usually just hype!
5,"Service is good... The newer waitors tend to forget you're there. Food is delicious, never gotten food poisoning... Cheesecake is magnificent... The best kind is the Godiva, expensive bit worth it!"
4,I have since revisited the store several times and I would be remiss if I didn't update my rant.  Debbie the owner has been friendly and helpful ever since I asked nicely.  I suppose with the amount of lookie loos or window shoppers in Old Town I can relate to the lack of enthusiasm.
4,"Alberto was so cute!  He cheerily greeted us and showed us to the bar.  We ordered the bruschetta with wine while we waited for our to-go order to be prepared.  Alberto visited with us briefly to ensure we enjoyed our bruschetta - and we loved our appetizer!  YUM!  Fresh, fresh, fresh tomatoes and bursting with flavor!  It was fun just being a part of the experience at Alberto's!. Try the desserts!"
4,"Hey Guys,  This place is awesome....but I could be jaded because of all the wonderful wines I sampled! From the gris, cabs, sparkling shiraz, riesling to the chardonnay, this shop had what we were looking for and what we weren't looking for! The atmosphere was amazing and quiet for a Thursday night get together. Our hostess was sweet and doted to our every need. The food was amazing. I completely recommend the crocodile pot stickers.  For exotic wines and exotic meats appetizers, look up Down Under Wines!"
5,"Beautiful hotel, great rooms, best views out of the resorts in the immediate area.  Service is comparable to a Ritz Carlton.  Very understated and clean feeling, yet still over the top luxurious."
4,Good place and food I'd very good for bar food. A bit pricey but good atmosphere. Great service.
5,"As far as indie record stores, this is truly as good as it gets in the valley. It is a breath of fresh air because it is a REAL record store, and you can sample CD's along the wall to get your music fix. I love how they have a list of recommended new releases. I definitely refer to them if my music is getting stale. Recently, my husband and I have bought albums from Beirut, Andrew Bird and Iron & Wine. They have everything your heart desires- so go and get you some! OH- and I just found out you can buy concert tickets there, and they usually give out a free ""Magnet"" magazine with each purchase. Woohoo!"
4,"Reasonable prices, good service, over-priced snacks (like every other theater) and comfy seats! I do enjoy this AMC very much though when I have to come here versus the Harkins on Northern. The one MAJOR drawback and this is a BIG WARNING is that if you go on the day of a Cardinals home game, EVERYONE and I do mean EVERYONE has to pay $10 to park in the parking lots at Westgate. The parking attendants will give you a ticket to take inside and AMC has a person there to give you back the $10 but the fact that you have to pay it to begin with sucks. What if I didn't have cash on me? This by no means is AMC's fault. I suspect it's the City of Glendale's or the Cardinal's convoluted way to soak people but at least you do get the money back if you are paying attention."
4,"Basicly i would let anyone know i like it, never heard a wiper of a bad experience here.   Def a fan, i work very close by and if i really need they would deliver, yeah their that nice.   How can i put it Ladybug House of Sandwiches or Sandwich shop for short what a great place in phoenix to take care of the lunch fill with out going to Subway, (not saying i don't go there).   When I need a real sandwich I stop in here.   They are a lunch spot so they close early and will have specail summer time hours.   Why ladybug house of sandwiches well, great meats choice of differnt breads and its like what I love the ladybug theme.  and just what you think of ladybugs their nice not pests, pretty and would make a cool friend.   Small note, i put my business card in their bowl once and actually won!  I got half off for the whole office, thanks ladybug ladies your the best.   Once again Kevin, lets you know whats real, kind of like me McDowell right accross from the Banner Hospital  right smack in the middle of the whole campus of medical buildings and offices."
2,"I wasn't that impressed.  The machines look old and rusted, there didn't seem to be any air-conditioning and it had to be in the 90's inside since it was about 110 outside.  They did have overhead fans.  The price was cheap--45 cents per load to wash in a top loader but we only found one top-loader available that actually worked.  Half of them were Out Of Order.  Instead we dumped everything into two front loaders that claimed to do double loads and were out of there in pretty short order.  We took the clothes back to my daughter's apartment building to dry in the laundry room there so she didn't have to stay with them."
4,"The new, old El Chorro Lodge has been reopened for all of two days, and a friend of a friend managed to secure a reservation during their soft opening, so I got an opportunity to check it out.  I was impressed, but not blown away.  Everything I tasted was quite competent, but if I had to choose a word to describe the menu, I would suggest ""staid.""  Perhaps even ""stodgy,"" but that may be more harsh than I intend. Review the dinner menu.  http://bit.ly/aWqVVJ.  There, see what I mean?  Replete with Traditional American entrees and sides, at what I would consider fairly exorbitant prices.  I would say that I wouldn't go back to eat this food at these prices, unless someone else was paying.   I should note that a big part of why I wasn't impressed is because this place is simply not my style.  The wait staff, attired in khakis and blue shirts, was a little too informal for the prices we were paying, I felt.  The menu options were a little boring for my taste.  The cocktail menu is exactly not what I'm looking for these days, although I will be very interested to see what Happy Hour looks like.  The decor is a tad heavy on the Old Southwest theme, although to be fair, this place not only pulls it off rather stylishly but also is among the most authentically old and southwestern establishments in the Phoenix metro area.   The patio and open bar are fantastic.  The bar area is considerable, and the patio is palatial - up above Lincoln Dr enough to be fairly quiet, with a gorgeous view of Camelback, sunset here must be incredible.   Anyway, back to the food.  Everything was very well executed, from the sticky buns we were served upon being seated to the desserts we ordered.  I chose the soup of the day to start, a tomato/basil concoction that was quite hearty and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The salads my dining companions ate looked boring to me, but they all claimed them to be excellent, with ""the best Caesar dressing ever"" and ""polenta croutons?!?"" being the verdict for the Caesar salad, at least.  On to the entrees.  I ordered the crispy duck, which I found to be delicious and quite hearty, though not what I would call crispy by any means.  It was a very sizable portion, and very well prepared.  My dining companions ordered the pork chop, the lamb, and the salmon, and we each sampled from each other's plates.  I would try the lamb if I went back, but the consensus seemed to be that everything was very well prepared, with the duck being a winner.  It was served with a heap of mushy sweet potatoes (just like my mom makes at Thanksgiving - delicious!) and red cabbage, which I sampled and declined to finish.  Again, not quite my style.   We moved on to dessert - sticky bread pudding with a bourbon glaze and the warm chocolate cake.  The bread pudding was a winner at the first two or three bites, but grew one-dimensional as I continued nibbling at it.  The chocolate cake was decadent, among the best I've ever tasted.  It was clearly made with a considerable amount of dark chocolate, which seals the deal for me.  And in case you were wondering, my dining companions apparently have no stamina when it comes to dessert.  Suckers.   Anyway, as I've said now several times, this place is just not quite me.  It's totally classy and very high in quality, but not quite adventurous enough for my taste.  I'd love to come back for brunch, and once they unveil their happy hour menu, I'm sure I'll be back to check it out, but I won't be back for dinner unless I can convince someone else to pick up the check at the end of the evening.   As a side note, this place is so very Paradise Valley.  It's a welcome relief knowing that there is a place that is so anti-scene out there.  It's been a little while since I've been both the youngest and among the poorest in a room, and I will say it was a little comforting.  Just don't tell the Scottsdale people about this place, and we'll all be happy."
5,"Today our travels took us to the Chandler Mall on 10/31/2012. Therefore we were near to Abuelo's for lunch. Nothing like returning to a Restaurant that you found to be very good! We arrived after 1PM, so we were seated ASAP. We ordered drinks first along with a serving of Guacamole. Nice way to start off lunch! My wife ordered the Dilla Lunch while I ordered the Grande Burrito Lunch special. Both item arrived on a very hot plate-wonderful! Whenever we are dining at another Restaurant, a hot plate is always expected but all too often the hot plate fails to appear. Our lunch stay hot until the last bite due to the hot plate service. Everything was great with the meal and no requested drink refills-always a sign of great service! Both restrooms were very clean and serviced many times during the day. We highly recommend Abuelo's for a great lunch or dinner!"
3,"Best time to work out at this gym is in the early morning.  Went in the afternoon a few times and it's usually packed.   This place has everything I need to work out. (threadmill, free weights, machines, basketball court, swimming pool, and sauna).  Rarely do I see any of the machines out of order/ broken.  Although the men's sauna bench was broken for maybe 2-3 months before they finally fixed it."
5,"I am 5'0"", so I require a lot of alterations and it is essential that I have a good alteration service.  I will never go anywhere other than Elegant Reflections for my tailoring services.  I have had innumerable pairs of pants hemmed here and have been completely satisfied.  They have nice private dressing rooms with real doors (I refuse to undress behind nothing more than a curtain), everyone on staff is competent and very friendly, the prices are reasonable, and they are almost always able to complete your alterations in less than a week. I have only ever encountered one issue..when I had two pair of very thick trousers hemmed with a cuff at the bottom, the cuff seemed loose.  Since I didn't want it to get caught on something and come apart, I took them back to be adjusted.  The second alteration was done in just a couple days (in winter, which tends to be a busy busy time for them) and the new stitching was nearly indestructible! The staff here also seems to have an exceptional memory, because even after a year hiatus- they greeted me by name!"
5,"So far, I have been to Lola twice (a Saturday night and Monday morning). Saturday night was very quiet compared to the super busy Monday morning. Free Wi-Fi, coffee, baked goods, and awesome location...you can't beat it. The morning we went, we had a Monterrey Jack scone that was really good. I laughed when I got my latte in a ""So I Married an Axe Murder""-esque cup. We sat along the high tables facing Central Ave and I really enjoyed surfing the internet and looking out towards Central. There are various types of seating as well as some outdoor tables. I really loved this place but worry that it will be one of those places that will be so popular, you'll never get to sit there. That is why I stopped going to Lux because it eventually got so crowded all of the time. My favorite part of Lola coffee is being right on Central and watching traffic and the light rail go past. Love it, love it."
4,"So i'm not here to buy spices or shop for sheesha, i'm here for food. Lots and lots of food. Luckily for me, Haji-Baba is known for tons of food at decent prices so I have a promising evening of stuffing my face without breaking my wallet. God, I sound like a really cheap buffet commercial. But really, to be truthfully, super blunt, honest-to-go-honest truth, Haji-Baba's food is not the best in the world but it is 1) fresh, 2) good quality, 3) tasty and 4) cheap. I am sure you can find better Mediterranean food around town, but this place is really good on your wallet and fits my needs just right. And hey, 215 reviews can't be lying. THE PEOPLE LIKE IT. They like it a lot. I ordered the gyro deluxe (gyro with raw onions and feta cheese), a side order of hummus, Babaganoush (eggplant dip), tried my friends lamb tongue and a pistachio  baklava.  If you are feeling adventurous and want to try the lamb tongue, lemme tell you: don't. Really, don't. There is nothing tasty about lamb tongue. It tastes slightly like roast beef but the texture resembles congealed liver patee and the big chunks are really scary. The only positive about eating tongue? Infinite pun jokes about talking about it forever. Get it? The gyro meat was pretty standard in the Gyro deluxe sandwich, the best thing about it was the creamy fresh salty feta cheese. Its the freshest i've ever had and they really DO slap it on that sandwich, like a boss. The babaganoush was also very very tasty with the pickle and the black olive- however- i would have liked bigger pieces of roasted eggplant than a hummus-like texture. The hummus was just A-OK, it needed more of a PUNCH of flavor. Last but not least, the baklava is my favorite dessert in all the land.. so obviously I enjoyed it. Heavy on the honey and not very crispy on the nuts, but pretty decent nonetheless. In conclusion, only use the tongue in your mouth and not the one on the menu, get as much feta cheese as your body can process and buy a desert to-go. BAM, lunch is served."
3,"this may be the fastest I have ever Yelped and it proves that I am hopelessly addicted to this foresaken site!!! Was in the area and figured I would hit up this burrito place.  i was in the mood for the slop that makes a tasty burrito.  This certainly was not bad. HUGE burrito. lots and lots and lots of meat tons of sauce, guac, cheese, pico, and more of all that too. Pretty tasty and now I am stuffed.  I am in the area from time to time so I think I will go back and kill some more burritos."
3,"Slices or Spinato's? When you're near Tempe Marketplace and don't want to miss the movie you are about to watch you should check this place out. Slices is more of a ""New York"" style pizza where as Spinato's is more of a homemade style pizza, and I don't say that with any disrespect. In fact, if I had to suggest one of the two places I would most definitely suggest Spinato's. I'll try outline my reasoning behind this choice. Slices just has their ""NY"" style pizza, and to be quite honest they don't even do it that well. There are tons of places in Phoenix that do ""NY"" style pizza, and a notable place is Venezia's on Southern and Mill, not too far from Tempe Marketplace. Spinato's does have an ""NY"" style pizza and a Sicilian pizza, and the latter is actually pretty good. On a Friday night, this place gets somewhat packed for dine-in, but you can order ""eat-in"". So basically, you order you food, wait to be seated, and then shortly after being seated you can get your food. This worked out pretty well. The service is also good, and the staff are pretty friendly. Bathroom was small, one bathroom for the whole place, but it was clean and well kept.  The pizza was very interesting, we got a Sicilian ""Traditional Vegetarian"" pizza. Essentially, if you could compare it to another pizza it'd be DiGiorno. Seriously though, the pizza reminded me a lot of DiGiorno's frozen pizza. This place has a unique homemade feeling to it, and even the pizza. I'm not saying its bad, its just unique. The crust is actually delicious, and I usually don't care too much about the taste of the crust, but this one actually tasted pretty good. The downside though is the way they served it, nothing to pick up slices with, and it was super easy for toppings to slide through the grill when it was warm. It became somewhat of a pain to handle the first few slices.  This place has serious selection issues. Let's see, pork, pork, more pork, and a little bit more pork, oh and a little bit of vegetarian stuff. Ok, so where does that leave kosher meat eaters? Not at this place. If you eat kosher meat, and enjoy it on your pizza, this is not the place to come. There is literally no chicken or beef available here in terms of toppings. This place is pretty good and moderately priced. My significant other and I shared a 14"" sicilian, and got waters which totaled to something like $15. Certainly not a terrible price, but for the price I think we could do a little better. I suppose if we wanna catch a movie after dinner we would visit this place, but it is certainly isn't on the top of our pizza visiting list. Its good pizza, it filled me up, it was tasty, but pizza is a competitive market."
5,"I have been going to Arizona Auto Care since about 2002 when I worked in the same complex. I have since worked all around the valley and moved out of state and back and I have always only taken my vehicles there for service! They are honest and professional and always take excellent care of my vehicles. Jeff is one of the owners and a Subaru master tech and has worked on countless Subaru's for me, friends and family! Jeff and team will give you honest and sound advice when fixing your car and not try to oversell you just to make up sales and quotas like the stealerships. Thanks again Jeff, Chris & guys at AZ Auto Care for years of great service and to many more!"
5,"Jason Silberschlag pulls off a pretty amazing thing here in the metro-PHX area.  Three shops with their own quirky details, passion and identity.  Each tailors specifically to the demographic at hand, which I can totally get behind.  The fact that each shop has its own deal going on is awesome - I really dislike chains and the chain feel/look.  I hadn't seen Jason in a while at the other shops, the times I'd frequented, and was happy to see him behind the bar when I came here for the first time. Just the same way the other Cartel shops have a selection of brewing methods, this one does as well.  Pour-over, aeropress, Chemex and traditional espresso (La Marz GS/3). As expected from him, our drinks were flawless.  He transfers this knowledge and passion to the baristas, which is obvious even when one leaves his establishment to go somewhere else - they stand out in the crowd of many coffee-pullers.  The beans, who can complain?  Jason made his name with the roasting. I got a prepared sandwich here, and my was it tasty.  Bread was fresh.  Sauce, ingredients and overall creation was good.  Big Ben: you stole my tastebuds' heart that morning. Casual lounge area (see: couches), outdoor covered seating (see: hallway - shaded and cool!) and plenty of seating inside.  As normal, his handiwork shines throughout the shop.  Somehow I've never reviewed a Cartel shop before, despite my years of patronage.  My latest experience changes that."
2,"A friend and I stopped here today for lunch. I for some reason thought it was an odd choice, but he seems to go often and enjoys it. In fact the woman taking the order said to him, no drive through today? It would looks as though he is known in the whataburger world.  The people working here are very friendly if not a little disconnected. I ordered a whataburger with cheese and onion rings and a small drink. I opted for the Hi-C. I do not like sloppy food and this burger would not have been if the bun had held up. But as it is onions lettuce and tomatoes are falling all over the place. The meat was dry and lacking an particular flavour. The onion rings were very generic and sort of soggy. I loved the Hi-C.  You know you just never know if you will like something until you try it. I tired it and that is enough. Nice friendly folks though. I do like friendly."
5,DUDE..where is the manga....where are the card tables. .....What the heck is this place doing selling comics! This is outrageous!  And why are you talking to me and trying to help me comic clerk! Your job is to give me a huge sigh and exasperated look as if I asked you to perform surgery. This being helpful and friendly is really bothering me. You guys are just too weird. I need to go back to Atomic.
4,"Why go to some new place that tries to recreate the ambiance of an old fashioned ice cream parlor when you can just go to an actual old-fashioned ice cream parlor? Unlike newer parlors, Mary Coyle's doesn't try to be self-referentially hip or ironic, they just serve good ice cream without pretense. The thing is, they must be doing something right since they're popular with all age ranges and different groups of people. Plus, it seems like the high school kids working there are having a good time and actually glad to see you when you come in."
5,"We showed up out of the blue on Valentine's night looking for food. We got a seat at the sushi bar right away, but the place was otherwise packed. I guess we were lucky. We passed on the V-day prix-fixe menu and decided to order as we ate. Our waitress was visibly perturbed by my wife's order of tap water to drink and vegetable tempura to start. Judging by her expression, she took us for deadbeats; it wasn't offensive but hilarious, we're old enough to be confident in our own opinions of ourselves. Anyway, the vibe at the W was definitely people trying hard to be cool and of-the-moment. In any event, we struck up a conversation with the chef behind the bar where we were sitting. We initially ordered some basic sashimi dishes, but when I asked the chef for suggestions, he started rattling off a series of custom creations he could make. So we let him do his best, and he turned out a great collection of sashimi dishes, none, at least as far as I could tell, on the menu.  We had a great meal, and we would definitely return, at least if we didn't live in San Diego. (The waitress eventually warmed up, probably thawing as she watched us eat through plate after plate of sashimi....)"
4,"Recently, I found myself in downtown Mesa looking for a place to sit an write a while while my son went to a concert - I had 4-5 hours to kill. I planned visiting one of the coffee houses within a 5 mile radius but my lack of familiarity with Mesa made that a disagreeable prospect. Fortunately, I noticed Lo-Fi Coffee, which was literally part of the concert venue building, before I began my trek. Lo-Fi was a comfortable place that served good coffee. But what made me a fan of Lo-Fi was the barista, an Air force vet who was friendly and went out of his way to make me comfortable (they closed at 9 and he let me sit in  until 9:30 - concert lasted until midnight). If I lived closer, or if Lo-Fi opened shop nearer where i live, I would go back again."
4,I visited Sala Thai with a friend and I had the Pad Thai.  Food was pretty tasty and very filling.  It had a nice tang but I might have preferred to have a fork and knife to cut the very long noodles with.  Other than that I'd definitely visit again.
5,"Navajo Food at it's best !!!!!! I loved everything there ! I guess I love ""BLAND"" food . :-) everything was terrific ...  I ordered the bowl (12 oz) of Mutton Hominy Stew I got it with the Tortilla bread which was AMAZING ! I also ordered a side of Blue Corn Mush to dip into my stew ( which is an awesome combination) ... And I also ordered a Grape Shasta Soda :-D ... My Husband ordered the Vegetable Mutton Stew with fry bread and ordered Strawberry Shasta Soda. He loved everything ! Everything was well worth the wait and the food was extra hot and tasted very FRESH !!! I LOVED IT !"
5,"Dr. Ellis is compasionate, caring, and really demonstrates his passion for what he does. The entire staff made us feel comfortable from the moment we walked in to the time we left the office. They went the extra step to make sure my 5 year old was having fun at the dentist! I would recommend this office to anyone who has children. Dr. Ellis and his team are the best!"
3,"My husband and I tried this place out since it is fairly close to our house and gets decent reviews.  I drank, my husband ate.  The wine selection is ok and the staff seemed friendly.  My husband's dinner was okay.  I'd probably give this place better reviews had they not attempted to give themselves a $15 bump on their tip.  I'd also probably give them better reviews if the manager would have called me back after leaving a message with a staff member about the charge especially when I left all the details necessary to fix the issue and was promised a call back that afternoon when the manager arrived.  Now, I can only assume it was not an inadvertent mistake since they give me no reason to believe otherwise.  I really would rather not have to keep calling back and chase my $$ down. Edited review - took them from 1 star to 3 stars since I received a phone call today from a manager and was advised it was a mistake and they credited me back the funds.  Also will be sending me a gift card for the trouble.  Overall, I appreciate the follow up and their efforts to fix the issue and bring me back in.  I was routing for them since the patio seems like a pretty chill place to have some drinks and unwind."
2,No good
3,"The fitness part of this place is great: machines are new and plentiful.  Good classes on the schedule, and plenty of cold water and fresh towels. Now, the spa, on the other hand, is mediocre at best.  The pool is a bit of a walk and available to anyone at the hotel; same with the jacuzzi, which also means the jacuzzi is outside!  Why no jacuzzi inside?  The steam room is small and there is no sauna.  There are only 3 shower stalls, with shampoo and shower gel, but no conditioner. The lounge area is also small and not at all relaxing.  And the robes are super thin (with a chilly room; that's not even nice!) and not very big.  I had to sit very carefully so as to not expose myself to everyone. Hello! haha. The massage itself was very nice, but the spa is not relaxing, especially for the prices.  I wouldn't return to the spa, although the gym is good."
5,"One of our favorite restaurants in the Valley! We go here about once a month. Some of my favorite dishes are the whole fish, salt and pepper shrimp, Pho with everything in it, Spring rolls, Shrimp/Pork over rice noodles, and the Seafood over soft egg noodles. We also have the Vietnamese coffee as our dessert! YUM!"
2,I've fequented here often enough to know that all the majority of the games here are all those ticket games and little claw type games. I come to hang out with friends and play some games. I can in on tuesday night around 6pm and thought to have dinner there since I had a coupon for the place. I really didn't care about price at the time with the coupon.  After being seated our waitress got our drinks took our order and everything was fine. After we recieved the food we were left unattended for quite some time. When the waitress finally returned I had to ask for a refill and some ketchup as well. My drink was empty so I would assume that would be something that the waitress would ask but I caught her before she left. My boyfriend did not recieve a single refill the entire night and we were there from 6pm to 9pm. We had friends meet us there and we just chatted it up for some time. It wasn't for some time that we realised that the place was bare not just of customers but of staff as well. It was as if they closed the place down and just left us. After the waitress had taken our check and cashed us out that was the last we saw of her. The plates of our food were still in front us the entire time and we had kind of placed them all together so that she could come and just take them...kind of thought that the bunch of plates stacked together would give the hint we were done but I guess I shouldn't be so subtle next time.  The food was ok at best. Nothing bad nothing good in hind sight though if I had to pay full price for what I got if that waitress had left us like she did and I didn't frequent the games I would've walked out. Probably wouldn't notice.  All in all go for the games if anything else. The games are even ok that is IF they are running. Sometimes I come in and games are off or not working. This is just a place that is convienent for myself and friends to meet up.
4,We've eaten at this location quite a few times. We've always enjoyed it. The pizza is great and the employees are friendly. We also threw my son's 6th birthday party here in sept. Our hostess assigned to our party was great and very patient with all the kids.  My son said it was the best party ever. We'll definately be having more parties here!
4,"I don't usually shop at AJ's unless I am looking for something very specific that I cannot find anywhere else. The item in the past has been canoli shells. I like to make home made canolis occassionally but I am never daring enough to make the shells. I can never find them anywhere other than AJ's. I would say that if you are looking for something special that the average grocery store doesnt have, try AJ's. They are a bit expensive though so I would go here as a last resort. Now normally, I would give this place only 3 stars, however, yesterday, I discovered their dessert counter. OMG, I was in heaven! I knew they had cakes and fruit tarts (which btw are outstanding although 30.00 apiece), however, they also have a vast array of mini gourmet desserts for when you have a major sweet craving and want something special to satisfy it. Im talking mini carrot cakes, mini fruit tarts (yes!!! I dont have to pay 30.00 whenever I want a tart from them), mini tiramisu's rounds, brownies, canoli's (WTF?) and even mini creme brulees! Additionally, they have home made chocolates which looked equally delicious. I opted for the tiramisu which was not only tantalizing but light, creamy, and honestly, one of the best Tiramisu's Ive had in awhile probably since the wine train in Napa. My best friend said that her praline chocolates were very good as well. I got a brownie for the hubby which is enormous and I will post an update once he tries it. What's even better is that the mini desserts are really reasonably priced so if you are looking for a dessert for someone to celebrate a birthday, anniversary, whatever, this is a great place to go."
4,Where else can you get a Chile Relleno wrapped in a tortilla to make a burrito? Super crunchy friend goodness with oozy melty cheese in every bite.. Oh the overkill and love every second of it!! Jen Red Pork in a quesadilla with a side of black beans and jerk fried rice.. this is some serious hybrid comfort food.. may sound strange but works very well! You'll leave super stuffed and change in your wallet from a $10!
2,Went downhill. Not clean and the food isn't what it used to be.
1,"Went to Sol for restaurant week.  Was less than impressed with the bitter salad with MIA avocados, the carnitas that were very bland and boring, the rice was delicious, however the black beans tasted like aspirin, dessert was a dulche flan that was hard, solid and icky.  Service was average, took 2 hours to get thru dinner.  Best part was the refreshing wine and beer! Cheers to SOL, we wont be returning."
3,"Not the best burger I've ever had, but a fun place to try with the coworkers on a Friday afternoon. I had the quadruple bypass and a few helpings from the all-you-can-eat fry station. Better than BK/McD's, but nothing to write home about. The waitresses were hot and they happily wheeled me out to my car in a wheelchair! But it's more of an attraction than anything else."
4,"If the melting pot exists, the cheeseburger may well be its most palpable product; to take a bite of it is to take a bite of history... -Elizabeth Rozin, Primal Cheeseburger Who could argue with that statement? Checked out Delux Burger today; Delux is a burger joint that gets some serious buzz and numerous Best Burger awards from the local media. They are also a late night favorite since they serve food until 2 AM. This gives them street credit in my opinion. The mystery dining companion, otherwise known as L. joined me for this burger excursion this evening; we arrived around 10:00 PM for a late supper. The seating is a bit cramped in the dining room and the patio. The Delux menu is very nicely limited, meeting my personal rule for just do what you do best. We both ordered the signature entree, the ""Delux Burger""($9.5), starring a half-pound of freshly ground Harris Ranch beef; supporting cast includes a toasted demi baguette topped with Maytag and Gruyère cheeses, sweet caramelized onions, applewood smoked bacon and organic arugula. We also ordered the Combination Fries ""a la cart"" ($6) which came out before the Burgers. The fries were fantastic! They were served in a mini shopping cart (making them easy to share) and included french and sweet potato fries. Two sauces were also included with the fries, a standard ketchup and a house aioli which resembled a thousand island type sauce with some kick.  The burgers came out shortly after the fries. They were impressive looking before we took the first bite - robust in size and the beef was perfectly cooked. Delux recommends to order their burgers at medium rare allowing them to showcase the juiciness of the beef; L. and I ordered our burgers medium and they were prepared perfectly. As we bit into these works of art, the beefy goodness oozed wonderful flavor onto our palate. The beef truly is the star of this show, however supporting cast complements it nicely without taking away from the magnificent flavor of the beef. This burger really hit the spot. I was able to command and conquer this burger, however L. was only able to master one half and took the other half home. Adam from Man Vs. Food would have been so disappointed with her. A few other good factors that Delux offers: Good service, fantastic beer selection, which are primarily microbrews from across the country, and reasonable prices. If Delux has a weakness, it's an atmosphere that's a bit trendy and possibly even slightly pretentious, but the burgers are so good that it's overruled. Overall, a fantastic experience... and another bite into burger history."
4,"Superb service and food. Better than average wine list. Steaks and seafood were cooked expertly, sides were just right. Seafood tower was put together appropriately for our 6 person group. I gave 4, not 4 1/2 or 5, stars because it was just tood darned dark and noisy. But still an excellent experience. Pricey as expected, but not overpriced."
5,"great service, efficient bartender, the place was packed and he flew around that place serving brewski's nonstop...awesome outdoor patio and great view of camelback...happy to see this little gem and will be back"
4,"Food : Fried. Carbs. Cheese. Yum. Selection: Main specialty and dessert. Sufficient.  Price: Under ten bucks a pop. Great. Parking: Sucks! I nearly died after having to park across the street (no room at the inn) via a running jaywalk across the 7th ave midday madness. However, I don't care. Gluttony is so worth it. Hours are rather limited. Better for me anyway, otherwise I'd have to start popping Lipitor because you'd probably find me here way too often."
4,"The best sweet and sour soup ever!  Food is delicious and favorable.  Delivery is pretty good, nice people."
5,"The bar and wait staff couldn't be better at this location of PF Chang's.  The food and service is better than any other 'Chang's' country-wide.  We just moved here from NY and missed our ""local hangout"".  The bar tenders and wait staff have made us feel at home.  We go at least once per week for wonder food, drink, and company with the staff and other patrons.  Thank you Clint, Gerry, Nate, Kyle, Nick, Angie, et al."
5,If you have never been before you should really try harder... Your mother taught you better than that. Go and buy a smoked pecan paleta.
3,"Alison B. sums up all the great things about this unique store - and I would return if I was looking for a unique gift for any female friends of mine. However, when I went in on a Sunday I was 1 of 4 women in the store.  The man working was chatting it up with the 3 other women who turned out to be together, and once they left he had a seat and didn't say a word to me as I browsed.  I walked out after several minutes of silence."
5,"I have to give them a 5 for their Guacamole and chips. I am just in love with it. Everytime I go to the US, I have to go there. Cheap, super tasty and I love the salad bowl option they have (as I cannot eat wheat flour). The meat is always tasty and fresh and again .....their guacamole ....the best !!!! Always clean and fresh with friendly staff. Healthy fast food ..... Just wish that we had it in Canada !!"
5,"This place has negra modelo on tap.  I would almost give them 4 stars alone for that.  The food here is incredible, very reasonably priced, and is mostly locally grown and raised.  Add in there musical taste, a mixture of latin and indie rock, and you have a place about to explode from too much hipster cred.  I mean that in a good way.  We live in the east valley, so this is a haul for us, but this is THE place we take our out of town guests.  Everyone loves it."
3,"Being the B, L, and D (breakfast, lunch and dinner) restaurant of a major valley resort takes allot of versatility. From scrambling eggs to grilling a piece of meat the new Rico's American Grill at the Point Hilton Squaw Peak Resort shows that all this can be done and more on a daily basis.  With two massive patios, a large bar and lounge area coupled with a fantastic selection of locally made beers on tap, just beckons you to try them all out. This is easily done by ordering up a Beer Flight ($7) which gets you 4 5oz glasses of their best brews, though this will be tough to chose, they're all good. Then you can order a capped 64oz growler ($20) to go! A growler is simply a large glass jug filled with your favorite beer, your choice. These are all the rage in other cities so I was excited to see Rico's making this offer. Id fill it with my latest favorite, Left Hand Milk Stout Sweet Stout. Think rich flavors of chocolate and coffee blended with milk sugars to give a sweet and creamy taste.  In the large dining room you'll notice a wood fired oven. Unfortunately Rico's doesn't take full advantage of this, only offering a handful of menu items cooked in it including the BBQ Chicken Flatbread ($12). Covered with pulled chicken, red onions, Rico's BBQ sauce and mozzarella, this paired well with our beers though could have used a bit more salt, easily remedied. Another glimmer of what could be was the Wood Oven Baked Penne ($13). Several large meatballs, roasted tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella and pesto ricotta cheese and al dente pasta made for a hearty satisfying meal.  A bit lighter but bold with flavor, the Chopped Salad ($10, add grilled chicken $3) made with grilled corn, black beans, bacon, tomatoes, cucumber, avocado, and BBQ-ranch dressing was shaken, not stirred, literally. The salad is brought out in a large martini shaker, dressing added on the spot then shaken well. Kind of a neat twist on table-side salad service, what's old is new again.  The Wicked Meatloaf ($15) could have used some of Rico's BBQ sauce for a sweet contrast instead of the semi-boring-more-like-brown-gravy cracked pepper demi. The meaty slabs were paired up with roasted garlic mashed potatoes that were well seasoned and comforting.    Perfectly cooked and perfectly tender, the New York Strip Steak ($21) had a warm poblano and bacon relish that I could have eaten by the spoonful. The smoky sweet relish made the need for any sort of steak sauce not necessary. Along side was a heaping helping of green chile mac 'n' cheese, so creamy and so gone, delish.  Apple Skillet For 2 ($7) takes apple slices simmered in a brown sugar and cinnamon, thanks to the wood-burning oven, then topped with cake crumbles and served with cinnamon vanilla gelato. If the skillet weren't so hot I would have licked it clean.  While Rico's may not have yet achieved culinary greatness, what you do get is solid Southwestern influenced American grub."
2,I believe this place is over-hyped.  the menu is overpriced.  the portions are small.  the meat is low quality.  slow service.  sterile decor.
5,"Such strange combinations of flavors, yet they taste so good.  We've been here three or four times and are never disappointed."
4,"So much food to choose from on the menu! They have so many options (healthy eater,unhealthy eater,  vegetarian, breakfast, lunch, etc)  for every kind of diner. I tried an omlet with turkey and brie and I enjoyed it very much. The orange juice was fresh. I was expecting very large portions but they are more than perfect for a super hungry appetite. Service was very good."
4,"I still like Lux better. Cartel is very appealing, though, to those who know their coffee. The menu is not huge, but it does offer basic, good drinks.  They have plenty of syrups to flavor your drinks, if that's what you're into. I like the atmosphere in there, and the bike wheel ""art"" is pretty interesting and unique. This place is probably really great to study in, considering the fact that I see a sea of macbook apples every time I walk in here.  The employees are funny and nice. Anyway, it is definitely worth checking out."
4,Their Bruschetta selection was absolutely amazing.
5,"T&S Glass did a wonderful job replacing my car window. They came right to the house within 2 hours of my call, had the window replaced within 30 minutes and treated me like a queen. Frank installed the glass and couldn't have been nicer. Thank you T & S Glass!!"
5,Food was really good. Waitstaff were all really friendly and helpful in selecting drinks and entree. Would for sure go back.
5,"It's pretty awesome here!  I was traveling in Phoenix for work and had to get my raw food fix (I eat a raw diet at home and as much as I can while traveling) and this was excellent!  The portions were large and the price was good.  The same type of food in places like Chicago are much more expensive.  I got the raw taco's for lunch and the blueberry fields salad to-go.  They were both great!  I also had an appetizer but that ended up being too much food so I packed it, too.  The location is actually fairly close to the airport (10 min drive) and so it will be my preferred place to go when I'm in Phoenix."
5,"Excellent food! I do say the service isn't always the best, but the outcome of the food exceeds my expectations. Definitely recommend ordering the Artichoke Salad! Not what you'd expect out of a typical boring salad! Not just stuffed with a large amount of dull, boring lettuce, but filled with spices and tons of flavor."
4,"This place is a nice little change-up from the usual mall/Target/splash pad destinations that summer requires.  We have an 18 month old son that loves the noodle forest and the tricycle area.  The place has so much going on it is easy to focus on different things even if we go once per week.  The price is high if you don't get a membership, it pays for itself just in summer visits and then the rest of the time is icing on top.  I admit to enjoying climbing around in the big maze in the center of the museum, that made me feel like a kid again."
5,"Anything I write will not do justice to this awesome, awesome hotel. I've stayed here a good dozen or so times over the past three years and it's always fantastic. I love all the rooms. If you can get a suite, you're an extra lucky duck, but even the basic rooms are adorable with phenomenal bathrooms. The bar and restaurant is also great, with fantastic appetizers, wonderful specialty cocktails, and fun rat pack music. Breakfast is better than most restaurants, forget about comparing it to standard hotel fare. The location is also good, with plenty of shopping, restaurants and bars within easy walking distance. This place is not within my normal price range at all, but it is worth every penny and I would never stay anywhere else in the Phoenix area."
4,"The service here is wonderful. Let me start by saying that, our waitress (I'm mad I didn't remember her name) waited on us on the patio. She was so nice and our friend can be a little overwhelming and has a strange sense of humor. She made sure everything we wanted we got. Even modified the desert special so we could have a hybrid of the white chocolate chip ice cream and a brownie dessert. My filet was wonderful and at a great price of 24 bucks... Me living in san francisco where filet's cost 40 bucks a piece this was up to par. The corn salad is also worth mentioning, wonderful flavors. Anyway, I could have been happy with many items on their menu... Also, get the dragonberry lemonade it is on their specialty drinklist and is great on a hot day!!!"
2,"Boring.  Uninspired.  Generally sauce-less, which means the meat courses are plain and dry.  The salmon tastes like styrofoam.  The filet is flavorful but they use low quality cuts.  The veggies are simply steamed.  No doubt the options are healthy, but at the sacrifice of flavor.  When I pay this much to eat out, I want to taste it and enjoy it."
3,"Similar to Los Betos - Fiesta is decent inexpensive mexican food. The staff is nice and accommodating. I did have a pretty hilarious conversation with the girl at the counter though... I was trying to order my burrito without onions, and she kept saying ""okay"" and ""yes"" and nodding at everything I said. I would ask her questions and she would say ""yes"" and press buttons on the register. It took me a few minutes to realize she had absolutely no idea what I was saying.  Aside from that, my burrito wasn't bad... nothing special though. The beans were from a can, the guacamole wasn't fresh (I doubt anything was), everything is cooked in or made of lard, their chips are flavorless and kinda stale, and they are seriously lacking any sort of salsa. They just have the typical generic nameless hot sauce found in these joints.  As I said - Los Betos... but cleaner and a little better maybe. It's just a place for convenient late-night munchies."
3,"We made the trek down from northern phoenix to get some authentic ramen.  I wanted to love this place and I wanted it to be worth the trip, but it just wasn't.  The decor is as previously described - you sort of time warp back to the 80's but it is clean and well loved by its owner.  They do have a lot of authentic menu items and a great kids meal, but the ramen was just not that good.  Its downfall was the broth.  Hubby got the salmon chirashi which was also not that fresh.  If I'm in the area, I may give it another try for the don-buris."
2,"I know this place has been around forever and is well established in the Valley. But I think its about time for some CPR! Everything about this place inside and out screams old school...all the way down to the service staff's uniforms! Ummmm...has anyone else noticed that this place used to be their parent's old stomping grounds? That's cool but how but making it inviting for the 30-40 yr old crowd?  I had prime rib that was barely warm and I swear had the flavor of a dry piece of toast! The most bland Prime I've ever had. The ""fresh"" horseradish I requested on the side was even bland. My friend had the buffalo meatloaf (half buffalo/half ground sirloin). Now that my Dear Reader was a home run! Tender and full of flavor!  The ribs were decent and the ""baseball"" fillet was par at best also.  We went on a Friday night and were 4 of perhaps 20 other people in this huge place! The website reads like its scrumptous. When in fact, the experience was more like waiting in line at the new hot club only to find no one inside!  Oh....the only redemption was the desert. Pecan pie and their citrus creme brulee....Both make you rub your belly!!! Bon Appetite!"
4,"Huge fan of this bistro. Everyday or two there is a new exotic meat that you must try. The staff is super awesome and Brant is my go to guy. I highly recommend sangria sundays, the wagyu and veggie burger are my absolute favorites. Not to mention, the sweet potato fries and Purple Haze beer.  If you like sliders, this is the best place to go in scottsdale."
2,"I really liked Joe's; the food and service was always good. But one bad experience has me wondering if I will ever return. The problem I had was with the service. We walked in on a weekday around 11, the place was pretty packed and there was only one server on the floor. We grabbed a table and waited about 10 minutes before she came over with water. We told her were ready to order, to which she replied ""I am really busy and have other people who need to order ahead of you."" In my 16 years as a chef, I have never heard a server say that. She didn't even offer to bring us coffee or anything. If anyone from Joe's is reading this, here's a little crash course in restaurant 101...if a customer says they're ready to order, TAKE THEIR DAMN ORDER! Anyway, we ended up walking out. Guess we'll be eating exclusively at Matt's Big Breakfast from now on."
4,"I will begin by saying that I've been wanting to try this place for months now, simply because they have a salad that bears my name. Which reminds me of my high school days, when the internet was new and I spent an afternoon with a friend visiting websites that also had our name. Most ended up being adult sites, but tonia.com* was an Asian company that had my name written in a fantastic logo. I wonder what it means.  Anywho, not only does the salad live up to its given name, but Moto is now on my backup sushi rotation. Reasonably priced and of good quality, I was extremely full by the time I ate only half of my dinner. The Tonia salad I actually had for lunch a day later, and was very filling and delicious. I can only imagine what it would've been like eating it the same night. Had it not been as great, I would've never came back and written to the owners, demanding the salad change to a lesser awesome name, maybe one more common or boring. My to go order was ready exactly when they said it would and I was in and out the door in minutes. I'll be back. *I have no idea if this is still the same site anymore. I am not responsible for where the link leads.. now.. or in the future"
5,I love this restaurant.  I really enjoy the reverse happy hour from 10pm-12am after I see a movie.  The appetizers are 1/2 price and they have some really good drink specials- better if you are a lady.   l like sitting out of the patio and relaxing. The sushi rolls are good.  So are the avocado eggrolls. Before I was a vegetarian the only thing I would order was the macademia crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and a creamy soy sauce.
4,"I didn't eat here, so I guess I can't give a full review. But I did have a beer, and I did take the Orbit to downtown Tempe, and I walked over here and had a yummy pint for 2 bucks on Sunday evening.  The more places that I can drink then take a bus home, the better."
3,"Overall this place isn't so bad for a quick mexican food place. It's not like eating at a restaurant or anything like that. The food portions are pretty great and sold at a fair price. I really liked their salsa and I felt it was nice and flavorful. I'd say this place is a small step up from Filbertos. The staff here, however, were really rude. They seemed to want to rush everyone around."
4,"I've been meaning to Yelp for a looong time now, and after having brunch at Scramble today, I thought it only fitting that I give them my Yelp virginity. My boyfriend and I arrived around 1pm and it was pretty quiet. There was a young lady at the counter, taking orders, and another stocking juices nearby. Both were very friendly.  I requested a vegan menu (the vegan options didn't seem to be listed on the large menu near the door), which was quickly furnished to me. There were 2 tofu scrambles, a soy chorizo breakfast burrito and french toast as possible choices. I couldn't decide between the veggie scramble or the french toast, so... I ordered both! My boyfriend went with the bacon and mushroom omelet (off the regular menu). We were offered bread options of white, wheat, rye, or an english muffin. The side dishes were fruit or sweet potato hash... and I think a lot of the menu items come with rosemary potatoes, but we both opted for the hash. The cashier gave us our number. It was a beautiful day, so we found a table outside. In a matter of very few minutes, our food had arrived. I noticed that the vegan items were on red plates to differentiate them. My scramble was yummy, with a good enough amount of veggies in it, and a bit more wet than most other scrambles I've had. I did find myself wishing the portion was a bit larger.  The order of french toast came with 3 good-sized pieces and was super duper good. The highlight for me, was the amazing sweet potato hash! It's served in a patty and is chock full of onions, zucchini, carrots (I think) and seasoned with rosemary. I've never had anything like it. I highly recommend it. My boyfriend did seem to enjoy his omelet and definitely agreed with me on the hash. Scramble is a great place, especially considering their vegan breakfast options, which are far too few-and-far-between in the valley. We will absolutely be back!"
4,Great fried fish and crispy onion rings....yum!
5,"Okay ya wanna know a little secret? I LONG for Green. Ever since moving back to New Orleans I'm surrounded by an embarrassment of culinary riches but our one vegetarian restaurant can never hold its own against Green. I passed through Scottsdale a few weeks ago to visit the Grand Canyon and the second I stepped off the plane at the Phoenix airport and secured the rental car we drove straight to the restaurant. Everything was just like I remembered it and slightly better. The staff was warmer and the food just as good. I'm still thinking about the ""crab"" puffs and the eggless rolls."
2,"I have to add to Andrew's review..... I just can't believe the things that happened!! Yes the app was good.  The entree was good too, but there were bites of just bread with no chicken in the panini.  It definitely would have been better with more chicken! But the girl working here is one of the worst waitress/bartender/hostesses EVER! When we walked in, she didn't even sit us.  We stood there forever waiting until she finally told us to seat ourselves.  We went outside since there was nothing left inside.  It was too hot outside so we came back in and figured we'd sit at the bar.  Luckily a nice guy noticed us looking around and let us sit at the end of his table that he moved apart since his whole party didn't show up for dinner. I was so excited when I saw they had cider on their menu!  And not just one, but two that I like!  Wyder's Pear Cider and Strongbow!!   I ordered a Wyder's.  After I finished it and asked for another, she said they were out of them.  Okay, so I ordered a strongbow.  She came back and poured it into a glass for me.  When I took a drink it was disgusting!!  It was Boddington's!!!!  When I finally got her attention away from flirting with a man sitting at the bar to ask her for the correct drink, she told me they were out of Strongbow too!  How are you out of both drinks??  You're a restaurant.  Shouldn't it be stocked?  You're right across from a BevMo for god's sake! When we ordered our food, he ordered the app.  Then I ordered my entree and she walked away!  She didn't even get his order!!!!  We figured it was probably for the best.  We'd split the app and the entree and eat less.  Stupid of the waitress to lose money that way, but whatever. When she brought my food, she didn't bring the correct things.  How hard is it to remember?  She had maybe 4 tables to take care of!  Maybe if she stopped texting while she's behind the bar on her cell phone or if she'd stop having a conversation with the guy at the bar, maybe she could have done her job a little better."
3,"Live entertainment, friendly, restroom clean, my dish was good, but my hubbies dish the meat was not seasoned at all and for a fajita they gave him a burrito flour size tortilla and took about 15 mins to bring a second one.  Plus hrs are posted wrong on yelp. States open from 6 am to 2 pm even though they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner."
5,"5 stars all the way.  Let me begin by saying that I'm a big fan of the products. The store is done in very warm tones and the drinks are incredibly aromatic and these 2 things combines seem to make all my stress melt away when I step in the door.  I'm not a huge coffee fan, but I can order some of the coffee drinks here. I'm completely unable to drink the caramel frappuccino from Starbucks, but I can't get enough of the caramel ice blended from Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf. So now that we've established that I love the product, we can move on to the real reason this place gets a 5 star review--the staff. I've never seen anything like it. If you come in 3-7 times someone will probably know your name and might even know your drink. Leila is the best at this. She knows peoples names, their drinks and if you come there often enough she even knows which car you drive. She'll see a regular customer's car pull up and she'll have the normal drink ready and waiting for them by the time they walk through the door. THAT is the epitome of customer service."
1,I will make this real easy for you.  Just go to in-and-out Burger if you don't want to feel gross and poor.
2,"So it's so freakin' hot in AZ I didn't mind that yet another frozen yogurt place was opening up in town. Stopped by on opening day to check it out. The place seems really small compared to Yogurtland and Zoyo, the yogurt is the same but they had these neat gummi butterflies as toppings that I loved. They were supposed to give yelpers a free gift but when I asked about one they said come back in a few hours because they weren't giving them away right then. Yeah right, this place is not worth going out of the way for."
5,best. grilled. cheese. and. tomato. soup. ever.
4,"Roka Akor Scottsdale is an extension of the celebrated Roka in London. I attended the opening night and a follow up for lunch the following day. Overall, I was impressed with the offerings of fresh sushi, and robata grilled tidbits. The dish that really won me over was crab hot pot and the creamy rice was absolutely zoftik. I drank many fresh sochu  infused cocktails, and crushed three bottles of sake with skilled Kikisake-shi, Sayaka Watanabe. This Japanese sake sommelier is London-based and the zuma-roka group sake trainer. They do have a fantastic sake selection. Easily the best in Scottsdale. She loved my sake brand I created with Midorikawa called Green River, and my low alcohol brand sake, Koide, as well. They also have a great Italian Sommelier named Alessandro Marchesan, who is also based out of London. Too bad they are only loaner personnel from HQ in London. The room is clean and beautiful with post modern Asian inspired lines. The staff is eager and young, but quite unskilled in refined service.  I am sure that will be a long cycle for the Roka management to fix. I have a dear friend who dined there on her birthday. She told me the service was ""shockingly bad."" She then reiterated that is was,  ""so bad that it was entertainingly bad!"" The food great and hopefully the service will match soon. Kanpai, Roka..kudos on your sake program."
2,"Not impressed. The young lady behind the counter aked like she could care less about my 15 shirts I had to drop off. I had used them before and nobody ever smiles at you. When I asked about pricing and how they protect shrinkage she said "" we can't guarantee anything"". Well, I can guarantee I will be goping elsewhere. You would think based on how expensive they are that they would care more."
4,"Great food and a fun atmosphere! service is a little slow, but the food is always delicious!"
5,This was our first time at Texas BBQ House. They gave us a sample and help us with our order. The brisket was fantastic. I got the moist and my wife got the lean. We both enjoyed our choices immensely. I will definitely go back. I wanted some spicy BBQ sauce and apparently they have it but I didn't see it.
4,"Brio is delish, plain and simple. I have yet to get something that isnt tasty. I live about 15-20 miles from one so I dont get out there too often but I do wish there was one closer to my area."
1,"I wish I could rate this place higher but my blow out is terrible. I asked for a blowdry with lots of volume and curl. It seemed that the cross between the mai-tai and cosmo would be perfect. My hair is flatter than what I walked in with. My hair is curly naturally so has decent volume, but for some reason its flat! Also the stylist pulled my hair alot while blow dryng and apologized for hurting me which I appreciated, but have never experienced with a blowdry before. I don't think I'll be coming back, sad since I love the concept and the salon is lovely. Update: They offered me a make up blow out. I decided to try the place out again, thinking it was a fluke that my blowdry was so awful. Mistake! Not only was my second blowdry here mediocre, I ended up paying for the service. I wrote to their manager who had offered the complimentary blowdry, but no response."
5,"I pride myself on being 'that girl' that tries out every restaurant I come across. It's practically a hobby for me. For YEARS I kept saying, ""I want to go to Cowboy Ciao"" but we never made it. Then, thankfully, the hubs' best friend had a big birthday dinner there, so we just HAD to go. (Thank you hubs' best friend!) I have to say that the service was incredible, and the menu was almost overwhelming. There were SO many interesting choices, but I had to stick to the tried and true chopped salad - everyone and their mother has told me about this salad, and I wasn't about to miss out. The hubs ordered the Tenderbelly Pork Shank.  The chopped salad has earned its reputation. That thing is de-freaking-licious. The Pork Shank dish was fabulous as well, but I couldn't get over how great the salad was! AND the server always came over to make sure that my wine glass was never empty. Seriously, can it get any better? For dessert we ordered the spumoni- I have had better (no offense) but I'm not sure anything served after that salad would have made me happy :) I'm very glad we finally made it to Cowboy Ciao and I look forward to going back - SOON!"
5,"Figured it is time to write a review after going here for quite a few years for dinner on special occasions or just to have some of the best seafood and Bone in fillet around.  First off you have to understand that the cuts are top quality so you can order almost any steak off the menus and be dazzled by the flavor, which is fantastic to the point that adding anything to it would destroy the integrity of the taste as is.  I mean the meat is perfection on a plate and this needs no other explaining. If with friends or even your significant other you must start with the the seafood tower, which can be order in many different ways to match your appetite and likes. When presented at the table you and your guests will be blown away at the quality of the seafood and rightly so as it is brought in fresh daily. The sides are too awesome in their taste and quality and i suggest the Lobster mash or the Maestros Mash potatoes neither of which will leave you hungry in their own right, but often wanting more :)  Wine selection is great and the atmosphere is top notch, but topping it with some of the best servers in town makes this one of my favorites for entertaining.  you will not be disappointed."
3,"I've actually never set foot inside this restaurant, so I can't comment on the place itself. But every now and then we've picked up orders from Old Spaghetti Factory at work, so I can comment on the food itself.  The food is as basic as it gets. This is definitely ""family food."" Most adults won't complain about it, and kids will enjoy the simplicity. I recently had the Old Spaghetti Factory's Chicken Parm. I won't call it bland, but it's nothing that the average home chef couldn't cook up for their family.  I will give the place credit for the portions. It's not expensive and you get a lot of food. While the chicken itself was not huge, it comes with Spaghetti, an entire loaf of bread and butter, and a side salad. The salad was way too plain for my taste, but at least I had a little bit of vegetables to go with my meal. It's also quick. Take out orders are almost always said to be ready within 10 to 15 minutes."
3,"I recently attended a conference in AZ and stayed at the Squaw Peak. The grounds were very nice, and with all the on-site activities this hotel would be quite a draw for the kids.  Being I don't have any kids, plus it was too cold to be out by the pool, activities on site were pretty limited. The gym facilities and the comfort of the bed made up for the lack of adult festivities. The gym was good sized and had ample new equipment. The bed was really comfortable and had great pillows.  Great for a family vacation, A-Ok for the business traveler."
4,"The Good Egg is a breakfast spot I frequent on a regular basis. During the week it's hopping with folks on their lunch breaks and the weekend crowd seems to be most predominant during brunch hours. The menu offers a wide variety of items to choose from. They are only open for breakfast and lunch, but you can order any of them at any time during business hours. Pancakes of a mammoth proportion are often seen zooming by on the arm of a server. Instead of hashbrowns, homestyle fried potatoes are served on the side of most dishes. The serving staff have always been very friendly and accommodating and it makes the experience a very pleasant one every time I am there. The patio is very large and can seat many. This is especially nice during sunny days, but not so much on a cold January morning even with the large heaters operating. If you go on a weekend morning, prepare for a bit of a wait. You can sip complimentary coffee outside while waiting for your party to be called. It's always fun to give a fake name for your party as it is eventually announced over a very loud loudspeaker for the world to hear.  When you hear Captain Caveman's party being called to go take their seats, keep an eye out for me giggling somewhere nearby."
4,"I hadnt been there in years, and it was all I remembered.  I went with a coupon that I go purchased on the Living social website.  Champagne toast, appertizer, salad and all you can eat entree.  They also do a complimentary photo for you.  Very quaint and romantic.  But the food was fantastic.  We had the cheese fondue that was just delicous.  The meat course was also wonderful.  But the thing that really made our experience great, was waiter.  He was great, and funny and he was there when you needed him. But I do not suggest turning up there without a reservation.  You can make reservations online, very quick and easy and you get a confirmation."
5,"I used Harvil's Auto Body after a fender bender. They were one of the auto body places that was included in State Farm's program. They were efficient, friendly, proactive, highly-responsive, and helpful. I especially appreciated that they kept me updated on the progress of my automobile and advocated for me/my vehicle when needed. This level of high-quality customer services is hard to come by. If you have a choice, choose Harvil's. You won't be disappointed."
2,The only thing I like about Fez are the pomegranate margaritas.  Food could be better...
5,"I loved Joe's Farm Grill...you haven't lived until you have tried the Blue Cheese Burger..(not sure what it is named on the menu)...I fancy steak encrusted with blue cheese, this burger is the next best thing.  Their garlic fries are to die for...heck, everything they cook is incredible...worth the drive..."
1,Filthy place.  Bad tasteless food.  Rude waitress.  Yuck!!!!
5,The best food I have found the area and the price is right.  You get so much food you have to take home.  Get there early to get a good seat fills up for lunch.  Priced just right.
4,I was so excited to visit The new Postino in Gilbert!!! I love and frequent the original but this new location is much closer to my house. Bruschetta is amazing!!! Love the atmosphere and staff too. Wine selection rocks!!! Great Happy hour prices!!! Highly recommend a visit!
3,"Not bad, but not my first choice for the area. The staff are friendly and the food is good, but it just feels too much like a man's club.  That being said, it is a great place for guys to go for dinner who are really looking for dinner. I think I need more... of something."
3,"Very good food but a little overpriced for the amount of food you get so the price is the only reason I am giving it a 3 star instead of a 4 star.  Cost about $11.50 for a small sandwich side salad and an ice tea.  All the food seems to be of the organic nature so definitely taste is higher quality. I have been there 3 times and each time left still hungry; however, did feel that I had a healthier lunch than other options in the area. If you are in the mood for a high quality / healthy light lunch and okay with paying $10-12 per person definitely give Essence Bakery a shot."
4,"I am excited about this place, even though I have not had many opps to try northern style Chinese food.  Think dough, and don't mistakenly believe it's the same dough steam/cooked/fried/stuffed in different ways.   The kind owner lady proudly told me each of our 3 dishes was made w/ a unique dough recipe...  At first I was worried all the dough would overpower my tastebuds, until I asked for some dipping sauce... they kindly made me a black vinegar, ginger, and scallion sauce... that just upleveled everything.  Who knows if it's traditional or not, but I implored the owner to start dishing this out when Americans like me (smiley face) come over and eat. The off-menu items are written on a small whiteboard sitting atop the freezer stuffed w/ to-go dumplings... luckily the folks there speak English, so I'll be working my way thru this secret menu and who knows.. this might go 5 stars! SW corner of Ray and Alma School, next to the JCC."
2,"My darling SO just looooooves this place, supposedly because they have a BLT that comes with avocado and a half-cooked egg on it. Ummm... OK. When he finally dragged me here, I realized he probably likes it because the waitresses hit on him. (Honeybuns, if you're reading this, they'll do anything for a tip. ANYthing...!?) I got a veggie egg white omelet, which had all my favorite components of caramelized onions and broccolini, but it tasted as if they had sauteed the veggies in the drippings from the burgers that just came off the grill. Uh, gross. This alone takes the rating to two stars, and I'm not even a super-strict vegetarian. It's just disgusting. The English muffin was this weird little hockey puck that really served no purpose other than to serve as a vehicle for the tasty, homemade apricot preserves that came on the side. The chocolate cherry scones were delish and the coffee quite good. The booth next to us held three 20-somethings (two dudes and a chick) downing mimosas, still wasted from the night before, who thought it fun to play their cell phones and/or iPods at high volumes. Just annoying as shit. Later, when I visited the swanky bathrooms, I saw the girl out crying in the lobby. Guess the swordfight didn't end well. I'll go back, so my SO can continue to get his ego stroked and his cholesterol raised, but I'm staying away from things from the grill..."
5,Yum yum yum. Husband and I first went there early on a First Friday night and were pleasantly surprised to be seated right away. We didn't want anything too heavy since we were planning on doing some walking so we split the Spanish cheese plate which was delightful. The fig cake is delicious!! Splitting the plate made the bill pretty affordable and it was just enough to fill us up without overdoing it. The server was very helpful in suggesting a champagne for me and red wine for husband. Don't remember what we had but my champagne had a strawberry in it and was perfectly bubbly.  Ambiance and decor is nice and mellow. We've since been back with friends and it has been enjoyable for both a date night and chatting it up with people. Enjoy!
5,"I admit it I eat donuts almost everyday and twice on Sundays. Today a I found a new addiction, french crullers, uhhh they are soo good. Melt in your mouth."
4,"Not a bad visit. I regularly visit the Location in Columbus, OH. I have developed a certain expectation as to the type of service that should be implemented in this concept. Compared to Hooters, this place will eventually put Hooters out of business. The food is consistent and delicious. I am a huge fan of the shepherds pie  and Quinlans 5 cheese pizza. The service at this particular Location was a few notches below the service provided at the Scottsdale and Columbus Locations. The servers seemed under trained in how to communicate with the guests. That preferred to fraternize amongst themselves which was the only fault that was noticed. The place was clean, restrooms well maintained, and the food was expeditiously served. Prices are a little high but who are we kidding, commodities are up everywhere. I will always stop by when passing this concept. Compared to it's competition of sports bars it is among the top of the list."
5,"After flying across the country we were hungry and as I've done in many other cities, I went in search of pho.   I ordered the pho dac biet.  The broth was not oily, and packed with flavor.  The noodles were just right and there was a generous amount of tripe and tendon."
1,Was I there on a bad day or what?  I showed up 15 minutes after they opened and EVERY item I tried was either luke warm or cold.    They have 15+ items on the lunch buffet and I tried a bite of all of them.   Gross and bland.   I felt sick to my stomach after I left because I kept thinking how bad the food was. Yuck!
4,"*Gamestop Burger* Visiting a friend in Phoenix I first see Smashburger from the street. Upon first glance my other friend and I thought it was a Gamestop cuz the sign looked just like it. We both said ""Haha, we thought that was a Gamestop."" Our friend goes, ""Yeah I first thought that too when I first saw it. It's pretty good there. Do you guys wanna go?""  So we ended up eating our first meal in Phoenix at Smashburger, and we were glad we did. The food was really good, and the smashfires were a great addition to our burgers. I ordered the BBQ Bacon & Cheese. It was quite delicious, and a little on the greasy side. BUT that's where all the flavor is!!!!! This burger has some hot steamy buns. Yeah I said it . Unlike most places that use the typical sesame seed bun Smashburger uses egg buns. These buns are a lot softer and compliment the burger very nicely.  I decided to order the smashfries which are seasoned with garlic and rosemary. These were an awesome choice. For those of you who may not like those flavors they offer regular fries as well.  Seeing that I hadn't eaten since morning I also ordered the Arizona devil dog. This had guacamole, tomatoes, jalapenos, habenero cheese and a spicy chipotle sauce all on an all beef hot dog. I liked it. It was like nachos minus the chips on my hot dog.  Now this place is on the pricey side, but if you feel like dishing out $8+ for a burger and fries then this place is not too shabby.  Different locations call for different items on the menu, so don't be surprised if the Arizona devil dog cannot be found outside of Arizona. I say that they should combine all the regional menus to make one giant-mega selection-awesomeness menu. But I highly doubt that'll happen."
4,"Nice atmosphere, especially outside patio.  Strange to see some people dressed gym casual on a Friday night, as well as some kids.  They poured Chimay into a pilsner glass, so bad marks for that.  Falaffel appetizer was nice, but Falaffel itself was too finely ground and flavorless.  Salads were really outstanding.  Enchiladas, also, were very good.  Thai short ribs were pretty good as well.  Great dessert options.  Overall pricey, but fair."
1,"I used to go here at least 3 times a week for Happy hour.  The volcano chicken was my favorite meal.  However, the last time I was in there I had a cricket in my water.  I took a sip squeezed the lemon, and thought there was something wrong with the taste.  I checked and at first thought it was a lemon seed but no, sure enough it was a cricket (in which i took a picture).  The way this restaurant handled an insect in my water was repulsive.  One of the male bartenders came over and brought a new water saying, ""It happens.""  No, sorry that's disgusting.  If i hadn't been craving the volcano chicken I went there for I would have just left.  And then on top of getting a cricket in my water there's no discount or compensation off of my bill."
4,"Copper Star is a great example of adaptive use in the heart of the Melrose curve. Who would have thought that a building initially designed to provide fuel to cars would so work so well serving fuel to humans? Their coffee is locally roasted and, while not my favorite, is well above average in Phoenix. Their drive-thru is a great feature for those mornings when I'm running late. For the coffee adverse, Copper Star serves chai, tea, smoothies, Italian sodas, and some unique drinks including a black cherry limeade. Foodwise, there is a wide selection of baked goods,including some of the best bagels. They also have decent lunch offerings, such as sandwiches and a tasty hummus platter. But where they shine is their 'home baked' cupcakes. (I've seen Mayor Gordon here on several occasions getting his cupcake fix!)  Despite being in a converted gas station/garage, the atmosphere is quite a bit more cozy than most of the other coffee shops in central Phoenix. While the sandblasted block walls and exposed ceiling let that building's industrial past peak through, this is offset by rotating art work and selection of comfortable (if a bit dingy) couches and easy chairs as well as small bistro tables and long 'work' tables to choose from. The staff is friendly and helpful, and the owner, Bill, is a great neighborhood resource. He can tell you anything and everything going on along 7th Ave. All in all a good place to grab a coffee and cupcake,  meet a friend or get some old fashioned reading done. I can't recommend it for serious work requiring internet access, however, as the wifi access remains intermittent at best."
4,"My mother located this resturant and wanted to go. I of course, looked at the reviews on yelp and was expecting a lukewarm time wih flavorless food.  I went to pepin last night and was pleasantly surprised to find the opposite.  There were 3 adults and 1 child in our party. My 2 1/2 yo decided to get cranky the moment we sat down.  The place was about 1/2 full.  Our waitress came right over to our table and started to take drink orders.  My mother didn't like the location of the table so they promptly moved us to a table of her satisfaction. The waitress saw my child was squirmy and offered to get her food out right away which she did.  I had the red sangria. It was good but I've had better. My mother had the tiramisu drink that was so strong it knocked her sandles off but it was good. I had the paella which was good and tasty. My mom had lamb which she enjoyed.  I forgot what the 3rd party had but he enjoyed his. My baby had chicken fingers and fries which were actually sliced potato and she ate most of it. The entertainment was great! I kept laughing to myself about the other reviewer who said they were intent on driving nails through the floor. Yes they were stomping up a storm but it was great. My baby was so entertained and yelling and clapping. Everyone was entertained by her too. Our bill came to $123 which is not bad for food and entertainment. Oh it was saturday night about 6:15pm"
5,Believe the hype. That's all I can say.  This place is the kama sutra of flavor for your taste buds.
5,"I will give this place a 5th star even though i wait for 30+ mins every time i go. that can only mean it's good right? Well, it's that friendly AND that good that i dont mind waiting. i hope it doesnt lose that customer service aspect that makes it so approachable.  best sausage gravy in town with a nice spice to it. i'm not fond of their potato has thingys... but their bfast nachos are fab and their white out omelette is also very tasty. my favorite item - turkey sausage eggs benedict... DD style (trade sausage gravy for hollandaise) - very filling as you can imagine.  breakfast club will still be the old town brunch location for when visitors come visit me but for week in and week out sunday morning brunch, this is my spot."
2,Friendly service but food was just ok. Maybe an off night.
3,"3 Stars only because the house margarita and guacamole was so good.  The food was decent (fish tacos), however the patio atmosphere was a bit sad. I understand this is more of a bar than a fine dining restaurant but the patio tables had no place settings, condiments, etc... Just cheap metal tables and chairs. Also - there was no music out there, just this incessant humming of a back alley generator.   The service was a bit sporadic out on the patio as well. We were asked by three different servers if we have a server yet. Not much in the way of organization.  Maybe management just hasn't gotten around to fully organizing and furnishing the patio yet. I hope they do, because they are in a great location and the food and drinks give them lots of potential."
3,Decent airport with a limited variety of food choices and a strange layout. It feels a little outdated but I was only at the airport for a quick layover.
4,"Good place to have a beer, duck fart, or whatever you may fancy.  I am absolutely in love with their fried pickles. They are so far my favorite in the valley. Long sandwich style slices with a crispy light beer-esque batter. They also have some wonderful perogies on the menu. If you order a burger... you must try the red cabbage slaw as a side. I like going here to just have a low key night. Good place to watch sports too- that's just not really my scene."
4,"KIerland Commons is a fantastic development. Lots of great shopping, restaurants, lofts, etc.... Only problem for me is that I live in Scottsdale and frequent the Scottsdale Public Library, therefore I want my tax dollars to go into Scottsdale's coffers so I will try to do most of my shopping and dining across the street at the Scottsdale Quarter (except for Zinc Bistro - I'll keep going to Zinc regardless of what zip code it's in)."
2,"REI.. I love you .. what and who did you hire??!!! BECAUSE you are such a 5star.. you rock.. you have all things for the active.. even for my active doggy! My active everything.. BUT when I drop over $100 on a reflective North Face jacket so Mark doesnt get run over on the run in the dark on his business trips.. & your startofffriendly and turntobeastwhentoldNO workerbee clerk boy checks me out and I deny his REI loyalty club membership.. not once.. not twice.. he asks whats my DEAL? Wait, DID he just ask me whats my DEAL??? (come here college boy.. ILL show you what my deal is!) followed with.. what you dont see yourself shopping here much? I glared at him.. and stated I was in an absolute hurry.. PLEASE give me my paid for merchandise because I SAID NO! My friend said thank you as we left.. and he actually chuckled.. umm no thank you back.. bad bad bad.. but I love the merchandise and the friendly folks in the bike and running area.. so its gotta rate a 2 for that.."
4,"I'm not a sushi expert by any stretch, but suffice to say that the rolls here are well-priced, fresh-tasting, and overall pretty damn delicious, with good presentation.  I'm not a fan of their tea, but that's just a personal preference, I think. I enjoy the Las Vegas, but the Spank Me roll was really good as well. We usually mix and match our way around, and right now they're running a ""happy day"" 4pm-9pm special on a lot of their rolls which makes them cheaper by $1-$3, each. Definitely worth it. Good service, laid back vibe, even if the decor is a little ""college dorm"" with the lighting, but overall, fun, good food, and affordable."
4,"I read that the guy who owns GoDaddy shot an elephant...at night...using spotlights...I'm thinking his fully tumescent ""manhood"" must be the size and color of a 7 year old raisin...I can't imagine what he thought he was proving by felling one of these magnificent creatures with high powered/laser sighted rifle from 500 yards away, while it stood transfixed by the spotlights glare. There was a word that we used for poachers that did the same thing while hunting deer, when I was a kid back in Oregon...""Asshole"". He did prove to me that I will need to move any and all business I can away from GoDaddy...""vote with your feet""...but I guess that's another review. The Beautiful Carin and I were in Scottsdale on business this past week and we take these opportunities to spend time with those near and dear to us! At the very tippy top of the ""near and dear"" list is our lovely daughter, Whitney. Whit is a Vegan...with a capital ""Vege""...and she was distraught by the wanton slaughter of an African elephant by some dot bomb misogynist. So she was thrilled that her meat lovin' daddy was going to take her to Green for dinner...an experience so very alien to me that I made Carin pick up a pound of fully cooked bacon and bring it to dinner in her purse for me...just in case! I am not a Vegan...I was born and raised on a cattle ranch...I do love a good medium rare rib-eye...I don't think it hurts Elsie the Cow to have a teat twiddled so I can have cream in  my coffee or cheese on my burger...and yet, the elephant deal brought a tear to my daughters eye and touched my black flinty excuse for a heart! I checked Yelp and saw that while my Vegan friends on yelp love this place, my decidedly carnivorous Yelpy friends were also nearly unanimous in their agreement that Green is foodgasm inducing! We ordered way too much food...Chili Fries, Egg Rolls, a Green Burger, the Secret BBQ Chicken Sandwich, No Harm Chicken Parm...I barely had room to choke down a couple of Tsoynami's and an oatmeal cookie sandwich! Even after we were stuffed, Whitney took home enough leftovers for a week! The big question about Green is ""why didn't I ever eat here, when I lived here...Why?"" I don't know...but I will be putting on my hemp cargo shorts, a tie dye t-shirt and growing a neck beard...and I will be eating here again. I like to ""fit in"". The menu is fairly extensive...the portions are plenty big...the flavors are bright and well defined and the textures and aroma's (always a big deal for me) are both exotic and welcoming. I didn't have to break out the bacon (although I should have taken my flask...no cocktails at Green for Donald...oh well, agave sugar cola was a delightful departure from the ordinary). I really could eat this way on a regular basis...it's that good...I probably won't, but it's nice to know I could! I imagine that Karma will have it's own way of dealing with a self-justifying, trigger happy technotard...for me, the occasional dinner at Green nicely balances the Karmic forces at work in my life...and tastes good, too!"
5,"Yes, it's on the Northwest side and its tucked into a non-descript strip mall better known for being the home of Padre Murphy's Sports Bar, but don't let appearances fool you, this is a great gym. The gym offers a large selection of cardio equipment, weight machines, free weights, and group exercise classes. It also has a pool, hot tub, sauna, and steam room. But will really makes this gym special is its kids care facility. It has video games, pop-a-shot, and a giant climbing structure that my kids like so much, they are begging to go to the gym... and it's a lot easier to get a workout done when the kids are excited about going! Definitely a great find and well worth the drive to the Northwest side."
5,"I was in this area and went here for lunch today based on the Yelp reviews. I had a molete and lengua, fish, and pastor tacos. Washed it all down with a Mexican coke, made an awesome lunch! Everything was so good I ordered a shrimp burrito to go and shared it with a friend after I left. I'll be back to try more things next time I'm in the area!"
4,"Over the last 3 years we've lived in the area, this place has changed 4 times.  First Uncle Bear's, then Tio Oso's, then Thirsty Cactus (or Thirsty Cantina, whatever, it sucked), and now it's TC's Pub & Grub.  The menu is typical bar food, including burgers, sandwiches, pizza, wings as well as some taco and quesadilla selections (which I always appreciate a good quesadilla so I will have to try it next time).  The restaurant section (which was always dead before) has now been opened up and TVs added so the whole place is more of a bar feel (thumbs up).  The place was packed for Thursday night football (Cardinal's game!), but still got a good table close to a TV.   Server (who admitted multiple times he was brand new) was very friendly but had to keep asking other servers for clarification on menu, etc.  Still, nice enough and very attentive. We ordered wings (""medium"" but they were spicy!) and their ""ugly"" crust pizza with mushrooms and olives.  The wings, very good, I would get them again.  Pizza, I wouldn't order it again if someone paid me.  The ""ugly"" crust basically is a thick hand tossed crust - too much crust (and half of it was burned) and very skimpy on the toppings.  It was pretty horrible honestly.  The actual toppings (although sparse) were very tasty... good cheese and fresh mushrooms and olives, so I would order pizza here again IF they have a thinner crust option.  Otherwise, if you are coming here to carb load and really need your bread fix, by all means, order the pizza.  I personally prefer a thinner NY style crust. All in all I would come here again based on the good wings and service, and I'm looking forward to trying their other menu options.  p.s. text TCSPUB to 411247 and they'll send you a text coupon for a 50 cent draft. Score! (I'm a sucker for a deal)  Cheers!"
4,"My man took me to Fuego for a pre-birthday meal on a Wednesday night. I was surprised to see how many diners were there a. Because it's a Wednesday and b. Because it's in such an odd spot!! Once you get past the randomness of it's location, you will see how quaint and homey feeling it is. The two servers working the front of the house were friendly multi-taskers who welcomed, advised and fetched drinks while we decided on, then waited for our meal. We started with the scallop app and agreed that it was great, although small (3 scallops/$13). How bout one more tasty morsel? Apparently, it was small to save room for the hulking entrees we graciously received next! Wow! I had the seared ahi-a huge portion of it spicily seasoned, lightly seared, and great tasting! The man had the stuffed chicken breast, and inhaled it. It looked great as well. Also in the ""great"" category were the side dishes! Omg, the cheddar massed potatoes were so freaking scrumptious I could die! I also had the jalapeño creamed corn, that I mixed with the potatoes to make a combo from heaven! Man got the green chile cornbread casserole, which sounded meh, but tasted incredible! Such a fantastic meal! Stuffed with amazing food, and pampered by attentive servers, I was disappointed that I couldn't give Fuego 5 stars. But it wouldn't be prudent.  Why, you ask?  Because the sangria sucked. I had both the white, that tasted like watered down kool-aid, and the red, that tasted like old, cheap red wine mixed with coke a cola. They both sucked. Not good. Hopefully it was an off night, beverage-wise and I just happened to be there for it. Everything else was spot-on!"
1,"I have so many friends that love this chain, but I'm not a fan. I've eaten at different locations across different states, but always end up sick. I think that I must be allergic to a seasoning that they apply to everything. I've gotten sick from salad, pasta, to steaks. Needless to say, if a friend wants to eat dinner here, it's tea or water only for me."
2,"Over the last 5 years or so, I've eaten lunch at Dilly's Deli a couple dozen times. The location is excellent, as it is near my office, and the interior décor is clean, modest, and charming. The music seems to vary, but on today's trip, it appeared to be a mix of oldies and jazzy easy listening. While I've never had to wait for a table to clear, seating can be limited during lunch hours. The service is friendly and quick and the menu offerings plentiful and interesting. Vegetarians will find a handful of options here, though it is likely you can request to omit meat from any sandwich or salad.  Carrying Boar's Head ingredients is a plus, however the way their sandwiches are assembled and the ratio of ingredients used simply doesn't work for me. Oftentimes, I find my sandwich has a bulge of deli meat in the center and much less (and sometimes none at all) toward the outer parts nearing the crust. It has been my experience that the wraps are not treated this way, though the only wrap I've tried (Mexi) lacked flavor and tasted processed.  I've eaten one salad at Dilly's - the Greek - and, while it is tasty, I discovered a dead fly in it halfway through and haven't ordered a salad there since.  As other reviewers have reported, the soups aren't as piping hot as I'd like, though the variety and additional ""daily soup"" is appreciated.  The bread is deliciously soft, warm, flavorful, and large - ideal for accompanying a soup or salad. If you're accustomed to filling up on a sandwich made with normal-sized slices, I suggest ordering a half sandwich so you can sample a side of soup, salad, or dessert as well. All sandwiches are served with a pickle spear. The cookies and brownies get 4 stars on their own. Today I gave Dilly's another shot and ordered a new menu item, the Red Bird, on wheat. Personally, I'm not a fan. The Blazin' Buffalo, Dilly Bird, and Smokey Mountain boast far better flavor combinations, IMO. Also, my pickle spear had a hair on it. Dilly's is a bit pricier than its nearby competition (All whole sandwiches are $6.99), though a reasonable price if shared. Overall, this is a higher quality sandwich shop than Subway, Blimpie, and the like. Unfortunately, the fly and hair experiences combined with the bread/meat ratio issue guarantee I will not return."
4,Great egg drop soup.  Kung pao chicken - meh.  Beef broccoli - yum.
2,"Meh. I've experienced better pretty much sums up my experience here tonight.   I have a sneaking suspicion that this is the go-to sushi place for people who either  A) don't know anything about good sushi or  B) have no taste buds and money burning a hole in their pocket I didn't really know what to expect from this place before we arrived. I'd never heard of it before and the only reason we agreed to go was because it was close to my boyfriends house and our friend said it was pretty reasonable in price and quality of food. My boyfriend and I arrived before our friends and we walked to in an almost completely deserted restaurant. There was some really bad techno remixes of popular songs playing in the background and an episode of Dr. Phil on the television. I sat down in one of their ridiculously tall bar chairs while my boyfriend went to grab us a menu we could look over while waiting for our friends to arrive.  Most. Uncomfortable. Chairs. Ever!  I couldn't have been sitting in it longer than a couple of mins before I had to get up out of it. The seat had an aluminum bar or something all the way around it that dug into my leg after sitting down. It's hard to describe how or why they were so uncomfortable, but if you've been here before you know what I mean. They clearly chose these chairs based on aesthetics alone.  Anyway, our friends arrived and we all ordered our food. I decided on getting the ultimate salmon roll and I believe it was called the sun roll. I could be wrong on the name of that second one but it was something close to that. My boyfriend got a couple rolls and we decided to share a plate of tuna sashimi. For the 2 rolls I ordered and the plate of sashimi it was almost $40. My boyfriend got the sunshine roll and a las vegas roll. Those two rolls plus a drink was more than $20. So all together we spent more than $60. I love sushi. I would be more than happy to pay those prices for a plate of delicious fish. But what came out was not what I was expecting for the price we paid.  My rolls were pretty, but they were almost inedible. I pretty much choked down the ultimate sushi roll. 2 or 3 pieces into eating it I debated wether or not it was worth finishing. The little tiny bit of smoked salmon that was inside was dry and I could barely taste the fresh salmon that was conservatively layered on top. I moved onto the whatever-sun roll and that was a little bit better but it was still lacking in flavor and texture. The sashimi was just awful. It didn't taste like fish, it almost didn't taste like anything, and the texture of it was really weird. It was almost chewy. My boyfriend and I have been known to just down entire plates of sashimi in less than a min or two, but after one piece he called it quits and it took me the entire rest of our time in the restaurant to finish the plate. The staff was pretty nice, I mean they weren't going out of their way to be pleasant with us but they weren't rude either.  All together I'd say this visit and the food was a total failure. I feel like this place's only saving grace is that it's clean and it's in a pretty convenient location. I would have liked to give this place another shot and try another couple of rolls before writing my review, but I was REALLY disappointed with the ""food"" (I am having a hard time even using that word because it was barely edible) I ordered. It wasn't the worst sushi in the world, but it wasn't anywhere near the best. And with the prices they're charging for these lack-luster rolls, I really don't see myself ever coming back here again."
5,"I just have to tell you that this place is amazing. Not only is the food top notch so is the service. It is a rare find to get awesome food, a comfortable environment and excellent service at a reasonable price all rolled into one. The homemade sausage is excellent, the pizza is perfect, the choice of deli meats is extensive and homemade side salads (red potato dill is my favorite) and everything on the menu is fantastic. I have read that people say the wait is long, (which I find unfounded) but when you are considering what you are getting, the wait means nothing. I have waited longer for Sysco reheated food in a restaraunt (bleh) and had worse service. I would take a 10 min longer wait for really good, fresh food any day. If you can't appreciate that then maybe chain restaurants is where you should stay. We really do our best to stay away from those and finding places like Defalco's is really tough. We will continue to be loyal customers and spread the word of one our favorite places to eat. Don't pass the opportunity to try this place!!"
4,"I'm a gelato purist, so Chill is right up my alley. You don't have a million flavor choices, but the ones they have are classics done right, so there is no need. The same lady is always working when I go, and she is very friendly and upbeat. They haven't yet perfected the multi-flavor ratio in one cup, but I'm sure that will improve, and I'm a huge fan of anything with a punch card. So far my favorite gelato spot in the Valley :)"
5,"I was given a $100 gift card to use at Willow Stream Spa last December... I've been waiting for the perfect day to use it since then.  Well, guess what? Today was that day! With my fiance out of town for the weekend, I took advantage of some much deserved ""Gabi time"" as I like to call my downtime.  I called a few days ago to make an appointment and I asked if there were any specials going on.  Lucky for me, there were several!  The one that was most appealing to me was the ""book any 60 or 90 minute treatment and get a complimentary 30 minute treatment to go with it.""  I chose to book a 60 minute aromatherapy facial and a 30 minute complimentary massage to go with it... I was in heaven! I'll back up a moment and just say that I've been to the Willow Stream Spa before... years ago.  Today was even more heavenly than I remembered.  I checked in around noon and didn't leave until after 6pm.  I could've stayed longer, but I had to come home to take Minnie out! The Willow Stream facility is gorgeous and includes every amenity you can imagine... I started out in the fitness room for a quick workout and then took a glorious shower before my massage and facial.  I had Tomi for my massage and she focused on my neck, back, and shoulders... (I've been having shoulder pain so I think she customized this based on my situation).  She was fantastic but with just 30 minutes, it felt like a tease... my facial made it all worthwhile though- it was pure bliss!  Heather was my esthetician and did a fabulous job.  I highly recommend her - she explained every product she was using as I fell in and out of a relaxing sleep while she not only worked on my face but my shoulders, chest, neck, scalp, hands and feet... the products felt amazing and smelled good too.  So much so that I bought a couple on my way out.   After my services, I had lunch (a delicious salad with veggies and chicken) while I wrote some thank you notes and read my book... It was so peaceful.  It was like an escape from the world and I enjoyed every second of it! So, bottom line - if you are thinking about getting a spa-lover like me a gift anytime soon, Willow Stream Spa giftcards are always welcome... what an experience!  I'm feeling energized, relaxed, and peaceful."
4,"When I found out I was going to Scottsdale for a vacation, I signed up for Groupon and was excited to score a tequila tasting at Cien Agaves! Well, I didn't read the fine print and it was only for the last Thursday of every month.  Not a problem - the owner/manager was great when I told him I had kind of skimmed over the fine print, and he still honored the group on.  We had delicious tacos, yummy margaritas and left thinking how great people in AZ are :)"
2,"I went to Gordon Biersch for a birthday party at the beginning of the month.  I had fun, but it had little to do with the establishment.  We had a special ""deal"" of $17 because we were such a big party.  There were soft drinks included in the price, but alcohol was more.  I have no issue with this, but the food was not very good.  I had a pasta dish and it was fine, but I am not dying to eat it again.  Then, we get our bills.  The price was not $17, there was additional tax and tip added on (which again is fine, but deceptive when we were told it would be $17 per person).  Then, my pregnant friend had a cranberry juice and sparkling water.  This apparently was not on the included menu and she was charged a $2 alcohol fee for her non-alcoholic beverage.  It just seemed a bit fishy to me.  Had it been an excellent meal, I wouldn't care about a few bucks, but it was just ok."
4,"I order the same thing at every Vietnamese restaurant. Rice Vermicelli Bun with Grilled Pork and Egg Roll, and spring rolls. This order does not change. Ever. They do the pork here more like a pork patty, or meatloaf if you will. In Vietnamese cuisine, there are two different ways to do it, the other being grilled slices of pork. I don't know which I prefer as they are very very different. You get a large amount of noodles, very fresh vegetables, and a generous portion of meat. The sauce is tasty, and everything seems very high quality. Spring rolls are good, as is the peanut sauce they serve them with. The service could be worse, but not much. It's pretty horrendous. Atmosphere is typical of a Vietnamese restaurant, total dive."
5,"Seriously.  I seldom give 5 stars, but it deserves at least this much. If it wasn't for the location and the super scary after dinner club scene, I would go every.single.day. Truly one the best BBQ places in greater Phoenix.  My mouth is watering as I'm thinking about the Hog Heaven special.  In fact, my puppies mouths are watering too.  Decent prices, giant selection.  One of those places where the early cowboys of the SW would appreciate.     If you are a cracker family, I suggest going super early, like super early bird special early , like when the snow birds come out for the senior special early, because after dusk, the whole place transforms into a pulsating super loud, super dicey Mexican Dance Club, and the blue hairs are sure to have a coronary attack after indulging in such a  lipid laden meal as they attempt to make their way out of the Club.     Ah the sacrifice for decent BBQ...."
4,"My niece and I were having that conversation...where do you want to eat...I don't know where do you want to eat when we drove past the Rocket Burger corner.  I turned around to try it because of good Yelp reviews and my curiosity regarding the variety of Soda Pop.  We both got a large hot pastrami sandwich and soda pop.  The price was reasonable, the food was good and the soda pop made it a nostalgic experience.  I brought home half of my sandwich.  Just reheated it in the microwave and enjoyed it again.  I'll return to try the french dip sandwich on the menu.  P.S.  The meat and secret sauce gave the sandwich a great bite.  It blows away the 'roast beef' sandwich I had last week at Subway that looked like reconstituted meat."
5,Nice Plaza.  Very well located.  Clean store.  Friendly staff.   All you could want
5,Tuck Shop is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Phx. Everything is superb from the service to drinks to food to overall experience. Definitely go soon!
3,Honey Bear's is no Joe's BBQ in Gilbert but I actually enjoy it. I usually get the pork sandwich and potato salad and I find myself going here. I like the BBQ sauce and the quality of the meat is good. If I'm in Tempe and want BBQ I usually go here.
5,"Visited this great place last week with my parents and sister and we all had a great time!  The service was a bit ""in the weeds"" but everyone was friendly and nice and the food was very good.  The tour is worth the $5 and then some, very informative, and our guide was very funny and knew her stuff!  products for sale are lovely and the  drive is worthwhile.  It is a bit way out but it was different and a great way to spend Sunday.  GPS do not like the address so try google maps and your phone/ipad it will get you there."
5,"The family and I love this place, as does anyone I've taken there.  First time I went I had a cheeseburger pizza - huge and delicious.  Their beer is great too - brewed right on the spot.  My wife loved the fish tacos -- it says a lot about a place that every time you go, everything you try, is fantastic.  You'll pay a little bit, but it's worth it."
3,"I really want to like MADCAP. I love the idea of playing old b-movies and some forgotten favorites. The boyfriend and I went to MADCAP last weekend to see their Chuck Jones presentation. Unfortunately, we were pretty disappointed, not that it was completely MADCAP's fault but still. My biggest problem with MADCAP is the price of admission. $10! That's more than a new movie. Why should I pay $10 to see a movie that I could get on DVD for half the price? I know the money is going to a bigger cause - having a cool theatre in town - but I just wish it was cheaper. If it was $5 I think I would go a lot more. For $10 it has to be something I really want to see and after not being so impressed by the Chuck Jones things I'm a little wary.  There wasn't even a screen in the theatre - just a white wall. If they showed new independent movies for $10 and old movies for $5 I think they would really have something cool going on. I hope they can figure it out because I'd really like to see the place become what it could be."
2,"Not a great experience last night at Eastwind. I'm going to start this by saying that I've been eating here for over 20 years, when it was Tokyo Express and now Eastwind. I was a customer weekly when I lived closer, now it's every 60 days or so. We went for dinner around 8:00 and it took way too long to get seated in the half empty restaurant. We were seated next to a family that must have been friends or family with one server, as she was constantly at their table. She was there while we were waiting and obviously saw us before finally showing us to a table.  Our server was a guy that must have been new, as he seemed very nervous and didn't know the menu.   So we ordered the sushi sampler for me and the Korean beef and a veggie roll for her. I got the sushi, but not the salad and soup that it comes with. The veggie roll turned into an egg roll. Everything came at once, and the server didn't make his return until we were done. After consulting with server #1, he took off the egg roll and our drink. Guess that's supposed to make up for it...."
4,"4.5: The only thing keeping this place from 5 stars is the location. The view from the patio is pretty much parking lot and the backs of buildings.  But, holy cow! The wine selection is VERY good. The staff are friendly and helpful and make excellent suggestions (thanks for the zinfandel tip! YUMMM). The prices are fair too! And, as much as I love green chile, my new fave is the fig and gorgonzola app. Still a pannini... I didn't know blue cheese could get that creamy when it melted! Man, I wish this place was closer... I'll still be back!"
2,"The food was good but, for the price, there are a lot better steak houses.  For this price point, I would suggest Donovan's or Mastro's."
1,I will never go here again. So disappointed when I went in its a cute store don't get me wrong I would buy so much there for my dog. But the day I went I went to get a treat for my dog for his birthday. The lady was on her phone the whole time talking personal business while my mother and I stood they're waiting for her to get off or put the person on hold. All we wanted to do was to ask her to get that dog cookie for us. So after 10 minutes of waiting we decided to leave and while walking out the door the lady shouted thanks for coming. That pissed me off cause she put down the phone to say bye but not to get an actual freaking sale. I'll continue going to to petsmart. Tried to support a local business but I guess when you own your own place you can have poor customer service
3,"I appreciate any airport restaurant that doesn't feel over-crowded or cramped.  We usually have to stop in Phoenix for our layover going to and from California from Texas, so I think this might be our new dinner spot.  It's big, plenty of seating, and clean. I love the affordable menu options...especially for being in an airport.  My husband and I both got the taco plates (mine steak and his fish) which come with two soft corn tortilla tacos, black beans, and rice.  The tacos were tasty but the rice and beans were flavorless and the rice seemed a bit undercooked.  After I drenched everything with hot sauce I was able to finish my meal. Although I love the cheap food options (around $6 for a taco or burrito meal), the drinks were super expensive.  Our Bloody Mary was $11!  My mango fresca (non-alcoholic) was about $4. The service was good and we don't really have any complaints.  This is a good option for someone looking for something not too greasy or heavy."
4,Thank you fellow yelper's for this recommendation! Probably the best chinese food in the west valley!
5,"Once we went to Grimaldi's in Hoboken, NJ and weren't all that impressed.  Yet the first time we ate at this Grimaldi's, we were blown away!   Upon entering, you are enveloped by the aroma of pizza baking in a coal-fired oven.  This is swoon-inducing---and I mean that in a good way.  The smell almost has you believing that you are in a pizza joint with a coal-fired oven in the Northeast. When ordering pizza baked in a coal-fired oven, I like to get a plain cheese pizza.  IMO, this is the best way to fully taste the sauce, cheese and crust without anything else get in the way.   There's nothing like a thin crust pizza from a coal-fired oven with that char on the crust.  The crust has just the right balance of crispy and soft.  The sauce is well flavored with proper proportions of basil and oregano.  The amount of cheese is just right.  I love to savor each and every bite. There is more to this Grimaldi's than the one under the Brooklyn Bridge.  This one has other items in addition to the pizza.  We like their antipasto.  It has sliced mozzarella which is fresh and creamy, black and green olives (the black ones are pitted, the green ones have pits in them),  roasted red pepper slices which are bursting with flavor, and a good, flavorful salami. Everytime we're in AZ, it is so worth it to us to deal with the heavy traffic in Old Town Scottsdale to dine at Grimaldi's!"
5,Wow!  I enjoyed staying here!  Huge rooms!  We had three adults and two children and everyone had plenty of room!  Highly recommended!
3,"Typical unpretentious dive bar where you can meet a friend after work, play pool, watch sports, whatever...  There's a pretty big food menu too.  I had the nachos once and they were quite filling and tasty.  Nice happy hour specials also.  I heard it was a place to watch Ohio State sports but it was pretty dead when I went there to watch a football game.  However, it was kind of nice getting a prime spot in front of a huge tv and the service was really good."
3,Similar to Desert Ridge.  All the typical chains are here. I like the Jimmy John's for a quick lunch.
4,Great location and within walking distance to Scottsdale and old Scottsdale.  Really well maintained and bed / pillow were the most comfy ever!  We typically stayed at another resort but this was a great substitute. They allow pets in many rooms so request a non-pet room if you wish.
5,"A very reliable local garage. Bill is all about great customer service, and goes the extra mile. He deflated my fears about ""being taken"" by other mechanics playing on my automotive ignorance. He's a truly good guy, knows his stuff, and will work to save me money if he can find it. I trust Bill, and 25th Street Automotive. Thanks, and we'll continue to bring our wheels into your shop."
4,"Very fun atmosphere and really good tasting food. Portions were large but not overwhelming so. Banana walnut pancakes were fragrant, tasty, light, and just the right balance between salty and sweet. Eggs Benedict was also very very good.  Definitely a place to frequent often as long as you don't mind a line, counter ordering, and finding a place to sit without a hostess."
3,"Other than at grocery stores, it's becoming more and more difficult to find a simple, decent donut shop. And for some strange reason, there aren't any Dunkin Donuts in Chandler or Gilbert (can someone explain this phenomena to me?).  I know, for donut purists out there, Dunkin Donuts is just another corporate chain.  But I happen to think their donuts and coffee are pretty tasty!  That said, Bosa Donuts is nice alternative.  It's a small shop with a good variety of freshly made donuts.  I especially liked the chocolate frosted cake donuts.  They were really good.  The coffee was ok, let's say... better than ""breakroom"" coffee.  Located just north of the Downtown Chandler area, Bosa Donuts has both walk-in and drive-thru service 24 hours a day, 7 days a week."
2,"Food was alright, nothing special, a bit bland. The water tasted so bad though, bad enough that you could still taste it through iced tea or tap water, do they not have a filter!?"
1,"I give this place NO stars. They have karaoke which would be good except for the co-host is NASTY! The rest of the bar is typical with darts, pool and poker. The food SUCKS! don't bother to go here unless you like being whined at by a wussy faggot at night long. I know that is harsh but the co-host really is nasty."
5,Amazing food and excellent service. LOVED the porcini rubbed delmonico.
4,"This is an open-air mall.  Unlike most malls which are totally enclosed, this mall is outdoors.  In the outdoor area they sometimes have ""events"".  The Batman ""Tumbler"" was there for a day once, we've heard concerts here, and this last visit they had a sculling team there with their boat. They have many of the usual shops (American Eagle, Gap, Aeropostale, Victoria's Secret, etc).   The Harkins Theater hear is pretty nice.  We like the Genghis Grill for food (see my review of them).  The Paradise Bakery is nice also.  There are several other eateries here, but we haven't tried most of them yet.  However, several choices are available. This is a nice mall to just wander and shop, and eat and drink, and enjoy whatever is going on."
5,"I booked our anniversary trip to the Westin Kierland through Priceline.  It was so reasonably priced that I was a bit concerned it would lack quality, and after reading a few reviews on Trip Advisor I was worried.  I was COMPLETELY wrong.  This is a 5 star resort from the moment you park your car.  The front desk staff upgraded our room, and this very nice gentleman greeted us with a smile every single time we passed through the lobby.  They have golf carts available to drive you to your rental car.  The food in Deseo is amazing.  I would definitely recommend trying the ceviche sampler and the muddled cocktails.  I can't forget to mention the amazing bread made with tapioca flour, they will even give you the recipe.  We especially enjoyed talking to the girls in the information center (the one that looks like a mine).  They were VERY helpful in giving us advice on local restaurants and insisting we take a day trip to Sedona......we did and Sedona is now one of our favorite cities. Thanks to Ashley, Miranda, Tiffany, Chelsea, and Pat.  When we returned from our Sedona day trip, we had chips & salsa, and two cold coronas.  This was a very thoughtful touch. If you are looking for a fine dining experience, Mastros Ocean Club is right across the street and has incredible food.  I highly recommend the lobster mashed potatoes and the seared scallops.   Back to the resort.......our room had a great view of the golf course which was massive.  Although we are not golfers, we certainly enjoyed the view.  Our room was a pretty good size and the Heavenly Beds are my absolute favorite.  When traveling I will do my very best to ensure we stay at a Westin Resort."
4,Solid place to grab a cup of coffee and a morning pastry.  Not sure about their lunch or happy hour but really love the layout of this place.  I tried their chorizo breakfast burrito too and it was very tasty albeit a bit pricey in my opinion.  Check this place out if you're in the area for breakfast.
4,"I have gone here several times and have tried the pizza, subs and the calzones.  I have not had anything there that I did not like and the only reason I don't give this five stars is because everytime I am in there it seems a large group with lots of young kids has just sat down (or come to run around me while I try to eat) at the same time as my date and I.  I admit, I wish restaurants had sections for families so that those who do not like watching kids run around or spitting food out of their mouths on to the table could eat in peace, but that is just me and that is why I have dogs and not children. Anyway, this place has awesome food, good service and if you can handle large groups of families then I highly recommend you take the drive out here to give it a try."
4,"This place shares with a Circle K. Hate to say it, but get your 44oz. drink in Circle K for 86 cents to go with your chicken. But I'm here just to deliver my Inside Skinny: Tuesday has a leg n thigh for 99 CENTS, mild or spicy! If you've had issues with freshness, go on a Tuesday, everyone knows about this deal and they're making lots of chicken all the time. LOAD UP!!! I get 5 orders and make it last a few days. MY PIG-OUT STUNT: Take the layer of skin from the top of a thigh and place on a plate crunchy side down, then peel off a chunk of chicken from the piece and place it on top of the skin. Apply a really generous amount of Frank's Red Hot or Trappey's Red Devil cayenne sauce. Fold skin like a taco and shove the whole thing in your mouth!!!! No one can top this deal. Church's tried but they just couldn't hang. Sometimes the Popeye's thighs are a little small, but hey for 99 cents, what a deal! Attire: Formal (Jacket Required) HAHAHAHA!!! I just had to."
3,"Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum. Good selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience. I think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.   Dim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures. If you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh."
5,"Not exactly what I expected ..................I liked it.  I was thinking some sprawling ranch house with wood floors and saw dust everywhere, maybe some old west artifacts on the walls and grumpy old waitresses.  What I got was a cool little funky building, with cool interior and neat things on the walls. More of a sports bar atmosphere with a good sized dining area. Killer staff and great food.  I had a burger, I believe flat grilled, cooked medium rare and I could tell it was good beef. They said they grind it themselves. The fries were great as they are a fresh cut type. The beans were different. They were a lighter vinegary type of bean with onion and bacon. I liked them but could not eat the whole pot that came out.  It ended up being a little expensive. 9 for the burger and Fries, 2.50 for the drink and 1.50 for the beans. Tax and tip it was an 18 dollar lunch."
5,I went here for my birthday this year. The best part was my friends picked up the tab:) The food was fantastic. When I found out from a friend who works here that the same chef who created the city hall menu is the executive chef at ocean club I knew getting a steak to compliment my fish was the right choice. The only down side was that everyone who went out that night were so full that we decided that it was a better idea to go home ad sleep than hit the clubs.....well maybe that wasn't a bad thing after all.
4,"My husband and I lucked into one of the best dining experiences in a long time on a recent business trip to AZ. The hummous appetizer was exceptional, as was the ""what's in this steak?"" dish, tender filet wrapped in yukon-gold potatoes (how comforting is THAT?). Nice selection of wine by the glass.  The only disappointment was a dessert referred to as a ""twist on Tiramisu,"" but which bore no resemblance to it at all, with toffee cookie dough ice cream. I'll go back next time in town, but try a different dessert."
2,"I recently went to The Breakfast Club for the first time with a good friend who I hadn't seen in awhile. It was a weekday and so, while it was still busy, we didn't have to wait to be seated. The food was good, but slightly over-priced. My biggest problem with the restaurant - the service. They were slow to deliver our drinks and food, yet once our food came, they were swarming around like bees every five minutes to take our plates so we could get out of there. I felt like they didn't care at all for the fact that I was having a nice morning with a good friend but instead wanted us to pay and leave. After we had been there for just over an hour and fifteen minutes, out waitress actually told us to leave the table and finish our conversation outside so they could seat other customers. We were mortified. I have NEVER been asked to leave a restaurant in my life. Needless to say, they didn't win a loyal customer with me."
2,"As much as I wanted to like this place, I just can't I've it 3 stars. Honestly I HAD to compare it to Postino's since 1. In my eyes they have the BEST bruachetta and atmosphere and 2. I heard the living room copied their style, and unfortunately it's a bad copy. They did get the atmosphere/ambience right. However the bruchetta not so much. We tried the steak, tomato and apple fig. The apple fig was delisous, but u can't really go wrong with that receipe. Been there done that. The tomato was a disappointment. Seems like they tried to do their own unique take on the original and for me it just didn't work. The steak was ok, unique yes. But I could live without it."
4,Great flatbreads and atmosphere
2,"I met some friends here for lunch, the menu is a weird mosh of Italian, Mexican and American food....it is almost like they can't figure out what kind of restaurant they want to be.  I ordered the cheese enchiladas which was probably the wrong choice at a non-Mexican restaurant, but I just wasn't feeling anything else. The two people who were with me got their food, and I was still waiting, and waiting and waiting. Finally the waitress came over and asked if anyone had been here to talk to me...isn't that her job? She said that they gave my dish to someone else by accident, so they are making me a ""fresh"" plate.  My enchiladas finally arrive, and look like they were just slopped on the plate. i take a bite and guess what? They were barely warm! You would think that a ""fresh"" plate would be served piping hot! I took a few bites, but by now I was over them and late for a meeting.  A waitress that was different than ours brought over our check, which included my enchiladas. I told her what the problem was, but she didn't seem to speak English very well and said she would go ask someone. They did take them off the bill, but that really should have been done automatically since the other people at my table were done with their food before I even got mine!  The decor is odd too, it is like they are trying to be a sports bar, but maybe aren't sure, evidenced by the 6 plasma TVs sitting in the corner still in their boxes!  If I have a say in the matter....I won't be returning to Deemos."
5,"This place has been here 7 years and we have never been. Are you kidding me? The food is excellent. The people who work here are friendly and seem to be happy to be there, which is most important. I tried the make your own half salad and half sandwich. YUMMY!!! There are many choices for salad toppings. There us nothing I like more than a huge, fresh salad. I chose to top my salad with avocado, tomato, bacon, edemame, feta cheese, and whipped balsamic vinaigrette. I really think this was the best salad I have ever had! They make the salad in front of you and mix in the perfect amount of dressing. I chose the chicken pesto sandwich. The combo of these items was a perfect portion for this hungry girl. The sandwich was excellent. My hubby ordered the Cuban pork sandwich. This is one huge sandwich! It was difficult to get his mouth around it, but once he did, it was awesome!! Typically, we don't like coleslaw, but it was really good, especially combined with the tender pork. We will return to the Market Bistro, again and again.  Loved it!!!!"
5,"We love The Olive Tree! We call it 'the grill' We eat there at least once a week - my littlest one has swim lessons right next door. Both my picky eaters love eating there! We love the chicken kabobs and the chicken shwarma(sp?). Family ran, great food we love it!"
3,"I had heard they were spiced just right but for me it was too salty of a burger.  It was also expensive considering a I had a burger, hot dog, fries and a shake.  Not a favorite but wouldn't mind coming again."
1,This is the closest to a New York hipster style coffee shop I've seen in Arizona.  They serve beer too.  Problem is that the espresso was unbelievably bitter.  Cookie happy hour is pretty cool though.
4,"In Phoenix on Spring break vacation, we found Baby Kay's by using the entertainment coupon book we bought to use while out there. They were in the front for fine dining, and had a great coupon deal, along with a sample menu. Everything on the sample menu sounded delish, and we very much like the spice of Cajun cooking. It was a little hard to find, although we were not at all familiar with the area. We had the wings as an app. and used the Louisiana gold hot sauce, something new to us that we are having trouble finding in Ohio since we fell in love with it there. The gumbo was outstanding, and even the alfredo pasta had a spice sprinkled on top for a Cajun style kick... it was unexpected, and awesome! Huge portions - that we both had plenty to take with us for a whole other left over meal. ... the prices were great, especially with the coupon (or actually the entertainment card that they punch for fine dining restaurants). Excellent staff- close to closing for the night, and welcomed us in, and didn't rush us at all - made sure we were happy with everything we ordered, very friendly! Definitely would recommend it for any one who likes a little Cajun kick, and something different from chain restaurants..."
4,"They have plenty of equipment so there should never be a wait for anything. They offer great classes, although they tend to get too full sometimes. It would be nice if there was a restroom up front so you don't have to walk through the entire shower/locker room if all you need to do is pee!"
5,"Restaurant 28 is a solid hole-in-the-wall that's pretty easy to miss, but it's definitely worth a stop.  On my visits I've gotten brisket and other barbecue, and my friends swear by the chicken and say it's some of their favorite chicken in the Valley.  The hush puppies are great- the greens are good too. Another review said it well when they said this place doesn't underseason food.  Every time I've gone it hasn't been bland- it's got some great flavor and it's tasty stuff. It's in a pretty dull area where there isn't much else to do, or I'd be out there more often.  It's a tiny place too but I've never been in and had it be hugely busy or busy to the point that waiting was crazy. Definitely recommended, and I hope they're able to grow and thrive."
5,"So glad to have found great Thai in my neighborhood.  We thought when we moved away from Tempe that we had lost our access to great ethnic food.  Luckily we found this little gem.  Great ambience, friendly quick service, and fantastic food.  We ordered the green curry chicken and the drunken noodles with vegetables.  Great sized portions for reasonable price.  We got ours on a 3 out of 5 scale of heat and it was perfect for us.  I have a feeling we'll become regulars."
3,"First of all, I have to give Dos at least three stars just because it's Dos. I mean did going to Dos make me feel old, yes, were there some interesting people there and not in a good way, yes, did I spend more money than I wanted to, yes, but all in all you always have a great time. Nothin' but laughs. The giant jenga didn't suck either.  Dos Gringos is a staple among the youngins, as I like to call 'em. In college, one will totally fit in, however, now'a days it's a place meant solely for people watching. And boy do you get an eye full.  Drink's are cheap, tacos are good, and the bathrooms aren't as scary as you would think. Go! Have fun, get drunk.... but don't expect anything classy."
5,Love Love Love!  All you need to do is order dessert here. It comes in small shot glasses & the flavors explode in your mouth..
5,"One of my fave places in Phoenix. Well stocked and friendly staff. I don't normally peruse the DVDs or CDs because they tend to be pricey,but one day I just decided to take a look. That's when Border's became one of my fave places. I was able to find a fairly rare documentary DVD. I paid 40 bucks for it,but have never seen it offered for sale anywhere before. I very much appreciate a business who refuses to cowtow to the ridiculousness of political correctness. For that alone was well worth paying 40 bucks for. I was even more impressed by the staffer who rang up my purchase for not only being knowledgable about the DVD but letting me know they had a biography of the director of the film that had just come in. Even though the shipment had not been tagged and put on the floor for sale yet,the staffer called to have someone open the box,and bring a copy for me to look at. I bought that too! I will coninue to patronize Borders and any other book store that chooses not to censor!"
1,"Don't do business at this unethical business. My $25 savings account from 2009 was  recently stolen from $5 a month for ""account inactivity"" fees. They are a bunch of crooks. It appears you now need to nickle and dime your customers with BS fees in order to stay in business.  Account closed."
5,"This little spot in the art district of Scottsdale is as good a lunch restaurant as I've been to.  I had the mahi mahi tacos, and was blown away by the attention to detail in the flavors bringing the dish together, as well as the wonderfully tasteful presentation.   Of particular note was the attractiveness level of the waitresses, about which I don't have sufficient words to do justice.  Both my father and I were hard pressed not to buy a condo in Scottsdale just to stay and have all our meals for the rest of our life there solely to appreciate the view.  They were dressed tastefully, not in the slightest bit 'slutty', but holy god."
4,"Totally a locals hangout. This very unpretentious wine bar is a favorite.  The owner, Darlene, has a great selection of wines from smaller labels for you to try.  If you're not sure what to get they'll help you find a bottle in your price range.  They've got the cheap stuff all the way to the $80+ range (if you feel like spending some money). You can buy a bottle at retail, open it up at their bar and enjoy it with a nosh.  Lots of smaller appetizers (cheese and crackers, etc).  Or, order by the glass/flight from their bar. Checkout their website before you go.  Or if you live in the area, subscribe to their email newsletter.  There is something different going on every day (live music, tastings, specials, etc.)"
3,"DVAP.... You have to go at least once in your life. It really is a neat place with alot of history.  The service is great, it appears to be family run.  The food is good. Better then Dennys but not as good as Mimi's.  I had the all u can eat of beef ribs, lasagna, meat loaf, cat fish, chicken, mashed and diced potatoes, stuffing, rice, homemade apple pie, etc and salad bar. I know I am missing a bunch of stuff they had but you get the drift.  They run specials on Prime rib and stuff so you might want to call to see what they are serving the night you go."
3,"If I could eat a southwestern Caesar salad once a day, every day, I think I would. This is one of my favorite salads...ever. Paradise in general is a little overpriced but one in a while, I'll bite the bullet and splurge. My only complaint is their lack of vegetarian options. For a restaurant that specializes in soups, salads and sandwiches, it would make sense to have more than one or two options in each category suitable for veggies."
3,"For quick fast food.. this is my choice.. I usually call ahead and get take out.. Dont expect super friendly.. but its just take out.. not clear table service.. even if you stay.. I always get the chicken salad with sesame vinagrette on the side but I will say, Im not a fan of the pungent dressing.. I get the chile sauce instead.. vietnamese rolls.. and its not so unhealthy.. NOW my friends that usually nosh with me.. hate the foods they get.. they say it every time I suggest this place.. who knows? Since I  havent really tried anything from my norm salad.. I cant say.. but for me its a strong 3.."
5,"As a bonafide recovering Art Bitch, I give this university gallery the blue ribbon award for kickassery! Truly a ""hidden gem"" (i hate that phrase) in Tucson, the collection and the revolving pieces never cease to impress me. I have brought almost every single tourist from the east coast to this gallery, including some photography professors, and they leave with snoooty mouths agape that in this pleasant little desert town resides a high-caliber, well manicured collection of the arts.  I am always upset when I visit and I can't stop by this gallery-and don't miss out out on their catalogs, magazines, books, postcards and prints they have in the atrium as unique gifts/decoration. Splleeeendid."
4,"I really like Bandera.  I really LOVE their cornbread.  Best dang cornbread I've ever had.  I dream about it in fact.  Food is always great, service is usually great as well.  Great place to take guests if you're not sure what they like. My only complaint...Bandera is a fairly casual restaurant, yet last time I was there my father was asked to remove his cap.  No biggie, he willingly obliged, but then I noticed the staff didn't seem to have a problem with the cute little thing wearing hers at the next table.  Come on, be consistent guys."
4,"I want to make love to a cream puff sundae.  Maybe even marry one.  They're that good.  Other than totally awesome desserts, this pace is a dump. The g-damn flickering fluorescent lights give me a headache. Go there for dessert, inhale it before the flickering lights give you a seizure then run before you get sucked into a shit-hole linoleum time-warp."
4,"Hike #4 for 2010 was North Mountain Park.  Got there around 10:30am on a Sunday.  Sunny and wonderful weather!  We got a parking near Trail #44.  We hiked up trail #44, it was strenuous but we needed a little more so we went down the pavement and off to this little trail that led us to trail #101.  Cool!  It was a little declines/inclines and between two mountains.  The scenary was goregous!  We walked until we hit trail #100 and we took a left.  Walked and walked..  Watched people walk their dogs & people riding horses.  Neat!  We got to where the trail ended.  Hum?  Went off to trail #60 then.  Another strenuous hike and it was a circle.  Circled back to trail #100 and we back tracked all the way back.  3-1/2 hours later we were back at the car.   Man, my calves are SORE today!"
3,It was my first visit to Wienerschnitzel and OMG two words CORN DOG! It is better than the ones at the State Fair. I also had the polish dog. I am sorry but Costco's is better. The french fries were OK. The best thing I had was the corn dog.
3,OH T.T.  at first you were intimidating...all these crazy people fumbling out of your doors....the odd screaming coming from the patio. Not to mention your lack of elbow room that causes your patrons to drunkenly shoulder check each other all night...but now i've grown to accept you. I don't love you yet...i'm still seeing other people...but i feel that we may have a future. see you soon T.T. like in a couple hours....
5,"We came here the weekend of the Grand Opening. I will say we were very impressed and  there was so much to choose from at this new and improved Pets Mart.  There is a Hotel here for Cats and Dogs. There is a Banner Pet hospital, and there is a Grooming station ,as well as a Dog training store as well. Talk about your one stop shopping. I even got to hold a beautiful baby girl Pug just 6 weeks old. She was absolutly adorable.   We took a picture but have not figured out how to download it yet. Nice and Clean all throughout the store . We purchased a few items and then we were on our way.  Lots of Parking in the lot. Plus nice clean human bathrooms."
4,Fantastic atmosphere. Very Very friendly staff. Food presentation was spot on. We had drinks and a Brick Oven Flatbread (cheese) and it was delicious. I can't wait to go back and try a full entree. They had a Salmon dish on the menu I am going to try when I return. I was staring at other dishes and they looked mouth watering.
5,"One of my new favorite lounges to go to with the girls.   1. I am a HUGE champagne fan 2. You can smoke on the patio 3. the drinks are great and 4. I LOVED the decor and atmosphere.  My friend and I were at Salt next door for a friends birthday party on a Friday night and decided to sneak next door for a drink to check it out.  The staff as a whole were awesome, everyone was very polite and sweet.  It has that chic feel with all the servers wearing cute corsets and dresses.  The DJ was great as well, fun music that kept the energy level up without making it too clubby and easy to still cary a conversation. Definitely a great new place to sit back and lounge in a place with a fun atmosphere and good service. Yay!"
5,"I've been a patient of Dr Lienau's since I was six years old!  I usually don't care who my primary care physician is, but when it comes to my dentist, there's no way in heck I would switch.  I even referred a co-worker to him recently!   He's very honest, upfront, and has such a great support staff.  Colleen is the NICEST receptionist!  One of the hygienists has been there for years (I forgot her name!!) and is also a very friendly woman. I definitely recommend Dr Lienau!"
3,"Great ice cream, but still just ice cream. Really enjoyed the salted caramel alongside a scoop of sweet corn. Feel a little silly for driving from Phoenix just for the taste but no complaints."
2,"I planned to order chocolate truffles from Truffle Trolley for our wedding favors.  We ordered the sample box to try them out.  They came in about a week and they were packed on ice which was really nice.  However, when we tried them, we just found them WAY too sweet!  We didn't like them so we are looking for something else.  Just make sure you try the chocolate before you buy to make sure you like it."
4,"This is one of those places that I always seem to forget to review.  I guess maybe because it seems everyone already knows this place is great!! The important details you need to know: - Live music sometimes - Great happy hour food specials - Most wines (3/4 of the wine list) is $5 a glass before 6pm.  Use your Yelp check-in offer to drop that to $3.  YES I SAID THREE DOLLARS!!!!!! - Great bruschetta, burgers, and everything else. Chef's specials are often enough vegetarian so that's nice for someone like me - Great back patio that isn't super obvious to a first-timer that it exists - Clean bathrooms! You know all of the above doesn't matter in the slightest bit if the restrooms are nasty - Wine specials on the 5th of every month.  Now, I have never participated but I think it's like $2 for a specific wine. But since you can use the Yelp check-in offer, I haven't bothered since it's cah-razy cheap every day!!"
4,"Welcome to the funkiest place in Goodyear. If you've been craving sheet-metal winged pigs but regretting that Cave Creek is practically a day trip from the west valley, you may feel tempted to lie on the floor and weep tears of joy. This Armadillo provides fine circuit training for working off breakfast at the Black Bear Diner, including a loft with moderately steep stairs. Like its cousin up toward Metro Center, it's an ""antique mall"" in the sense of focusing mostly on vintage items and less uncommon antiques, plus a smattering of ""collectibles."" This is the kind of antique mall I prefer, since it really functions as a sort of fantasy department store for shoppers who have a middle-of-the-road budget but whimsical or retro tastes. Like the other Armadillo, stock here runs somewhat more to the frilly and ornate than to the mid-century modern, but it's not a total lock-out of swellness in favor of sweetness. Unlike the other one, there's a larger variety of dealers who aren't typical antique-mall fare: things like reproduction hardware, the aforementioned sheet-metal winged-pigs, repro tin signs, garden ornaments made from vintage dishes. This isn't my cuppa, but in context, it provides useful variety, and it fills booths (there are more empty booths here, but it's still fairly new). A number of dealers seem to actually be replicated here, including the scrapbook store. Also replicated is the cheery professionalism of the operation: clean restrooms, occasional seating areas, efficient check-out, and available snacks. When you're hiking a layout this big, these things come to matter."
4,"I went here Saturday night with a party of 4.  It is a pretty neat place in a neat area.  I felt pretty hip and urban being there.  Anyway, I NEVER eat pasta because I ""try"" to stay away from those carbs, so even coming here was a giant step for me.  I wasn't expecting the pasta here to be anything great but boy was I wrong.  Each one that I tried was excellent.  The ingredients tasted fresh and delicious and each was very flavorful.  I don't remember exactly which ones I tried (I tried 4 of them), but each one was excellent.  They probably don't make a bad pasta dish. Some of the dishes have some odd/random ingredients, but don't let that scare you.  Order each dish as it is listed on the menu and you won't be disappointed.  When I feel like I have to get carbed up for a big race I will return! I'm still a little pissed that they didn't have diet coke or any diet soda at all for that matter.  Who doesn't have diet soda?  I get that they are trying to be green, local, natural, organic or whatever else is hip right now but come on.  I know I should probably stick to water anyway, but I always enjoy a diet coke with any good meal.  I'm not sure why, but I just love it and it makes my meal a lot more enjoyable.  Weird, I know."
3,"Went here last night with another couple for dinner.  The pitcher of margaritas was spot on, the chips were outstanding along with the guacamole and salsa.  I ordered the tortilla soup which I ended up sending back cuz to be honest it tasted and looked like a bowl of enchilada sauce.  My husband ordered the filet and enchilada which I have to say was cooked perfectly and definitely would order if I ever went back.  The other couple ordered the beef short ribs which I didn't taste but they both agreed it was over cooked. Service was great but when I have to send something back which I rarely do I can't give more then 3 stars."
4,"We finally went back to Merc Bar last Saturday night and as I suspected would happen, I liked the place a lot better when it was dark outside! My husband and I took my sister (who was in town for the weekend) to meet a few friends before dinner at Lola Tapas (review to come in a few minutes).  We were the first people in the bar, which was a little awkward at first but kind of nice, since we had a fancy, chic space all to ourselves! We all enjoyed our drinks, including my husband's and my dirty martinis. My only gripe was that they didn't come with the blue cheese olives mentioned on the menu already in them. Instead, the server brought them to our table and then asked if we wanted the olives.  I still don't think I'd linger at Merc Bar for hours (unless I was drinking Red Bull drinks to stay awake!) because I find the vibe just a bit too underground for my tastes, but I will definitely be back for a pre or post dinner drink."
5,"Four Peaks serves up some great beers and great eats.  This is no secret so no matter which day out of the year or which hour and minute out of the day you go you will see a full patio, and a populated bar.  Plan accordingly.  Try their Italian beer bread, the Carne Adovada, or the Southwest burger and wash it down with a pint of Hop Knot or Kilt Lifter.  You will be happy you did.  All of Four Peaks' menu items are appropriately priced and you will always leave satisfied."
4,"We went to Central Grille on Thanksgiving for their buffet.  Good food, excellent service and very nice ambiance.  We asked to sit outside and the weather was great for it.  Great place to sit back, relax and enjoy some food.  While I didn't drink they had a pretty good wine and beer list.  I will go back, enjoyed the experience."
4,"Came here for breakfast yesterday, it had been years since I have stopped in here and do not remember the entire place having waiter service.  Place was empty at 9am on a Tuesday morning but the atmosphere was casual, this place is pretty much been here for as long as I can remember and I am one of the 2 people that are native to Phoenix.  I always felt it was pricey but I think inflation has caught up since prices seemed normal when I went yesterday.  I loved the chips and salsa, the hot sauce is fantastic with a great spicy kick.  I went with the recommendation of the chile relleno which isn't my favorite but I like going with what waiters say so I gave it a try.  It was great!  Very flavorful and they just put it on the eggs so you can eat it together, the tortillas are fresh and home-made tasting, the hash browns and beans were good too.  I read my newspaper and drank my soda while I enjoyed the whole place to myself....oh yeah, I read some Yelp reviews and bookmarked my next stop too, ha ha."
4,The food wasn't phenomenal but it was very good. The service was excellent. The decor was very cool. A good experience. Great selection of wines by the glass. Very pleasant experience.
5,"It is almost impossible to find a great sandwich shop that actually has good grinders and sandwiches.  Well my search is over.  I stumbled across this little shop and felt right at home in New England.  Being from Connecticut, I was so excited to see all the great food on the menu.  I had the Vermonter and it was bliss at every bite.  The owners are extremely friendly and you can tell that they want you to be very happy with their food and service.  Great food and great service, you will not be dissapointed...."
5,"What a cool little place tucked away behind a strip mall.  Would never have found this if it was not suggested by a good friend who raved about the cappuccino!  He is world traveler, so, it's a  must try if it's the best cup he's ever had.  He was right!  Don't know if it's in the beans or the care that they take to make it with a fab froth decoration on top.  My hubby and I loved the caramel brulee taste..  My son loved the hot ""warm"" cocoa.  Yeah, we walked in as a family last night and almost everyone turned our way since we did not fit the hip college crowd.  Everyone was really friendly, though. The sweet young man behind the counter gave my son some micro cinnamon doughnuts and scored major points with the little dude!   We will be back."
1,"For the past three months I've been receiving unsolicited spam text messages from these clowns, so regardless of how nice a place this might be, I'll never stay with them or any other affiliated property for that reason alone. I've complained to the hotel (I was blown off), blocked them from my cell phone account, and filed a complaint with the feds. So...since the hotel continues to find it appropriate to light up my cell phone at 3 am with spam texts, I hereby award them a generous one-star rating."
2,"The doctors are great, especially Dr Mouaikel but the set up to communicate is not patient oriented at all .  When the office is closed for lunch 12-2PM you cannot even leave a message .  You need to call back again and listen to the lenghtly preamble about directions , office hours, emergency numbers etc.  You still have to press the correct number and leave a phone number for a return call.  The return call is late that day or even the next day. The recording suggests yiu use the website yet you have to be signed up for the website and I cannot find out on the website how you get signed up.   I would rather go to the DMV rather than have to call the AIA office for other than an appointment.."
1,"I came to the restaurant specifically because of a recommendation. I am now on a gluten-free diet and have other allergies so, suffice it to say, I don't get to eat Italian often. However I was told that they have gluten-free pasta and other choices. I was initially impressed by the sheet that breaks down their meals by allergen so that one knows what is safe. Kudos on that. This is more than most places provide. However, they have Basil Pesto Sauce listed as NOT being gluten-free nor soy free. Finding that odd, I asked the waiter to confirm with the chef, and I was told there was no wheat product at all in the pesto, which seems correct. (I did not ask about the soy, but I would wager that sneaks in somehow thanks to the cheese.) So I ordered the Create Your Own Pasta of gluten-free penne with pesto sauce, shrimp, peppers, spinach, and mushrooms. When my bowl of pasta arrived, it had all of the above. However, it also had onions, zucchini, and eggplant, yet I had to dig to find a shrimp. I originally assumed I had somebody else's order. The waiter, who was wonderful and attentive, took the bowl away and offered to replace it as I ordered. I would have eaten the original bowl, and told him so, but I was more concerned, as I said, that it was someone else's. As a side note, if these flourishes of extra vegetables are an example of a cook's flair, I would say that if a customer orders a straight menu item, that might be acceptable. But when I fill out a cute little checkbox form with what I want on my Create Your Own Pasta bowl, I *only* want the items I checked off. A fresh bowl arrived later exactly as ordered. Except the pasta was undercooked. I don't mean really firm al-dente. I mean some were still way under done. Now, I know that gluten-free pasta takes longer to cook, and they probably rushed the bowl to get it to me. But that bowl was almost inedible. The waiter did offer to get me a third bowl. I declined and soldiered through it. We were having dinner out for my wife's birthday and I did not want to belabor the meal. The waiter then offered us dessert to make up for the problems. Though I did agree to this, and I'm not demanding or even asking for a full dinner cost to be covered, it seems inadequate for management to offer me a three dollar dessert to make up for a twice-failed $14 dinner.  I do not intend to go back."
5,"After a night of debauchery with friends, my friend and I found ourselves craving a comforting bowl of Pho. I've been a regular at Cyclo's for quite sometime but decided to branch out and try something new. I was pleasantly surprised with Pho Ao Sen! I am always happy when I enter an Asian restaurant and see Asians patrons...probably sounds a little weird but to me it speaks volumes. The tranquil aesthetics of this quaint cafe made us feel welcomed and relaxed. The decor had a modern Asian feel: minimalistic organic zen with soft ambient music playing - perfect for a Sunday afternoon. We ordered the Pho Dac Biet Bo Vien- House PHO'nomenal (House special combination of *sliced eye round steak, well-done brisket, well-done flank, soft tendon, tripe, and beef meatball) and the Pho Tai (Sliced eye round steak) and Goi Cuon- Spring Rolls. As with most Vietnamese restaurants the portion size of Pho is quite large and we could have shared. Both were delicious, filling, and had a nice aroma but nothing too overpowering. I've experienced a few places that use a little too much anise, so much that you can't get an overall sense of all the delightful herbs and spices used in this delicious creation. The Spring Rolls had a very fresh crisp flavor and were the perfect accompaniment to the Pho.  I give Pho Ao Sen 5 stars! Best Pho I've had in the valley, beautiful atmosphere and friendly staff makes me one happy girl! :)"
5,"This is my favorite spot, waterfalls everywhere, beautiful flowers, fun slide, and great food!"
5,"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!  I have tried several of their subs and although they are all delicious the Chipolte Cheese Steak (it's the # 43) is my favorite!  It is the MOST DELICIOUS sub I have ever had!!!  The bread is always soft and fresh, it is extremely filling because it's stuffed full of steak, peppers, and cheese!!!!  To make it absolutely the BEST sub ever have them add some of the little red chili's to it (I think they call it chili relish)....OMG!!!!!"
5,"I'd give it about a 4.5, but I like rounding up for local businesses!  The owner has been in there every time I've shown up, and the food comes out hot.  The prices are spot on what you'd expect to pay, and so is the quality.  I'm not from Chicago, and have only been there a couple times, so I wouldn't be able to speak to its authenticity - but I can speak to its taste and the great customer service the crew provides every time.  If you're in the neighborhood and thinking about a hot dog, burger, fried zuccini, italian beef sandwich, or chicken burger, skip Sonic and DQ - they can't touch this place with a 15-yard drive-thru window."
2,"i was really unimpressed with the pizza here. it's conveninetly located, but never very busy, even at it's prime location by a bar even on a friday night. cheap slices, and easy to get in and out of, but of all the many, many people i know who frequent this area, none of them really ever eat there."
4,"Back again.  Still thinking about the flatbread pizza w/ tandoori chicken. I told my friend not to order it as an appetizer b/c I felt it would be too much food intake.  One of the best things I've eaten in a while.  I can't wait to order that as my MAIN dish next time. Soooooo good. You gotta try it! The chutney and all the flavor combinations were perfect.  It didn't sound so special on the menu, but it is!"
4,"Really great burgers...I would hope so with a name like Smashburger. This location is really good, so it gets busy at lunch time. Waiting is a bit of a pain, but it's typically not too long. The food takes a few minutes too, which is a positive in my book. The food here feels a lot fresher and better than fast food, though if you've seen their burgers, it's not a place that's super healthy. They also offer chicken sandwiches (crispy or grilled), and salads, so there are some healthier options, but the winners here are the burgers and fries. Definitely try the smash fries. Tossed in olive oil, garlic and rosemary, they are delicious. Burgers are really good and juicy, and the ingredients they use seem fresh. Cons are the long lines, and it's also not a place where you'll be in and out in 15 minutes. It's also not inexpensive. A burger, fries and a drink will run you $10-11, which seems high for ""fast food"", though I think it's worth it. What's nice though, is that you sit down with your number and they bring you your food, and they'll bus your table, so it feels like a combo of fast and full service...I suppose this is a perfect example of ""fast casual"".  It's pretty close to my office, so I'll be back often. Definitely worth a try if you're in the area and craving a burger."
4,"I entered the CPK world late in life, and I'm sad about it because, apparently, I've been missing out.  CPK is great!  Contrary to what I thought, it's not just a place for pizza.  Although the place can suit all sorts of tastebuds, I would recommend going JUST for the pizza.  I went this evening for the second time in two weeks and ordered the BBQ chicken chopped salad.  It maybe could've used a little more dressing, but it was still good, so I can't complain too much.  When I went last week, I ordered one pizza from the MANY great options available, and I have to say, there is a reason it is called the California PIZZA Kitchen and not the California SALAD or PASTA Kitchen.  So 'Yay!  I'm a fan.' of the PIZZA here.  The other stuff....meh.   The servers are always pleasant here, and I never wait a long time for the food to come out.  Prices are what you would expect for a chain restaurant.  Parking isn't usually a problem unless there's an event going on at Tempe Marketplace.  The up-side to eating at this particular location is that you can browse the shopping area before you stop in or after you're done eating. Be forewarned: If you are ever asked if you want avocado with your salad, and you say yes, you WILL be charged extra.  Look out for this sneak attack."
4,"oooooooooh man am I SO GLAD this place isn't near my house, I would gain 20 pounds in no time!  My sister took me here for the first time a couple weeks ago and my mind was blown by all the unique flavors they served!  The shop itself is very cute and modern. I like that they have a section in the back with a bunch of board games, very cool.  As for the ice cream I got the dutch chocolate and the horchata. The horchata was so so good, I cant stop thinking about it!  The following week I took the husband there. Again the ice cream was very good but the service was terrible. It was an older lady behind the counter and she really couldn't care less that we were standing there. She let me sample an ice cream and then I just stood there for a good 5 minutes while she did other things behind the counter. We did finally get served but my husband wasn't impressed with the serves one bit. This time I got my ice cream in a waffle cone, the cone was so light and airy, I loved it!"
2,"In Short: Long lines, complicated menu, and a fist full of dollars ........ for a hot dog? I guess I never bought into the whole gourmet hot dog fad, and probably never will.  I've heard my coworkers talk about the dogs, and on more than one occasion seen astronomical lines at the counter, so I thought why not, it had to be good, right? Talk about sticker shock, and only for a single dog?  Very overpriced indeed, on top of that, they managed to complicate a simple hot dog.  Various types of meats and topping options were a bit confusing, not because there were too many choices, but because non of them were really explained.  A little annoying for a first timer customer.  The dogs themselves are not bad, but I think you'd have to a complete idiot to mess up a hot dog.  I still don't get whats so amazing about it, definitely way too overpriced, won't go again.  They can keep their wieners and shove it!"
3,I didn't have an outstanding experience in this place. Breakfast was typical and service was rushy.   Solid 3 stars Biscuits were yum
2,"I give up. When you can still see the dough through the sauce and the cheese and the $2.00 extra cheese, and when the manager looks at it and says ""yeah, that's extra cheese"", I won't be going back. Sorry."
4,"If you want bruschetta, you cannot go wrong here!  You get to pick four. Request to have them cut in fours, much easier to eat! FAVES Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone Brie & Apples with Fig Spread  Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil  Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios  Salami with Pesto The green picholine olives ARE SO GOOD! Raspberry Chicken Salad is good.  It's a little sweet, but I always ask for the dressing on the side and just use a very small amount. We usually share this as well.  The Brie and Prosciutto panini  The pieces of paper  with 'your gum here' So cute! Mon/Tue after 8pm $20 bottle of wine AND bruschetta! Awesome! Cons-Loud. Really loud. Acoustics in this place are terrible when it's busy, and it usually is.  It's a little better when the doors are open.  I guess they can't really do anything about it since it used to be a post office.  Hence the name 'Postino'   Desserts are mediocre Crazy busy parking lot If you don't want to valet, you will have to park down the street on campbell near the residential streets."
5,"OK ok ok.  I'll have to agree with some of the below reviewers that this place isn't dead-on authentic Mexican food.  That being said, I love it!  The place is huge, sporting a bakery (said many times before) with unbelievably dirt cheap pastries (not said as many times before), a little carniceria (not as good as Carniceria Sonora) and a huge dining area.   The dining area with all its painted mural glory is so goddamn cool that I find myself wanting to just hang out there for hours watching La Primera Division de Mexico on TV and enjoying a nice $2 Dos Equis.   The food - that's probably the only tougher part.  Keep in mind it's still pretty good, but there are better places in the area for getting your Mexican on food wise.  The potato taco is worth getting because it's fairly unique, but it came out so soggy that I had to eat it with a fork.  I grabbed a couple of the Yelp-Advertised taquitos as well - keep in mind these are not the Circle K, rolling taquitos.  They are literally just smaller tacos, but they were damn good. I guess when it comes down to it, I'm an atmosphere buff.  There were so many cool things to check out in this multi-plex, and the atmosphere was so warm that I'd love to head back again soon."
3,"I've only flown in and out of Pheonix Airport through Southwest, so i've only been in one section of this airport- but it isn't that great. THe food choices are slim and none are fab- I mean, really what airport had fab food- wait DFW does! Anyway- the Sky Harbor does have is a great view and decently clean restrooms."
4,"Friendly, knowlegeable, GREAT coffee, cute place where you can everything from meetings to weddings, take a yoga class, and meet great people on Monday nights for Leashes and Lattes!"
4,"We had the luxury of eating here over the past weekend and what a treat. I had the 8 oz. filet (with the blue cheese on top) and my wife had the 6 oz. Both excellent! Side dishes (starch/veggie) were solid! We ordered the house wine (recommended) and also cheaper by the glass than other featured items. Also, I am thrilled to see some of the newer restaurants coming to the area. Having lived in Carefree for almost 15 years...seeing it start to boom in addition to offering restaurants with flavor instead of simply Western decor really is nice.   Waiter was extremely informative. I even joked that he could of probably been a voice over in some animated movie or tv commercial.  Anyhow, thanks for a great night out. We plan on coming back next time we visit...can't wait to try the seafood."
5,"This is what I love about Phoenix, you find these little treasures where you expect them the least! Loved everything about the place. We had a team dinner in one of the rooms and it really felt like we were having dinner in someone's dining room. Super cute atmosphere, loved the pictures from all over Europe. I has the vegetarian rellenos (sp?) and my mouth is still watering just thinking about it.  We also had the only malbec they have by the bottle and it was delicious!!"
2,"Good price for the location;however it's definitely outdated and appliances are extremely old.. Maintenance people fix things quick but some fixes are sub par.. My neighbor and good friend continue to have water intrusion in there home when it rains hard. They have to have their carpet padding replaced multiple times because of water coming in from under the building. I work for a property management company myself and this half fixed issue is something that I'm not impressed with.  Also, every year they increase rent, they don't work with you on price and don't seem to care about good paying tenants (Like myself). They are too corporate and only care about the money and not the longevity of good on time paying tenancy.. The only reasons I stay is because the location and price is good, but also because I hate moving around. I anticipate that rent will continue to go up and well over what other nearing apartments properties have to offer. This would mean that I probably have only another year or two left before rents over $1000 for a two bedroom...  One good thing is that the staff is nice and friendly but supposedly Equity Residential (managing/owning company) doesn't give their property managers enough power to work with their tenants. It's unfortunate really because I would imagine that companies would rather have long term on time paying tenants and negotiate on rental amounts and try to weed out the consistent late or non paying tenants.  Keep in mind that no utilities are included.. Hope to see some change in Equity Residential but because of how corporate they are, I highly don't think that this will happen.."
4,"Great new addition to Mill Ave.  First stopped by here for a Monday Happy Hour, and instantly loved it. This is a perfect day-drinking place when the weather is nice, and they do a good job of creating a large indoor / outdoor space with plenty of patio. Happy Hour is pretty great - 1/2 off almost all beers. (they do well drink / wine specials too, but don't remember what they were. I think it was $1 off... but don't quote me on that.) Bottom line, I had 3 Firestone DBAs, and i think my bill was about 8 bucks before tip. Score. (normal beer prices are in the $5-6 range. A vodka gimlet not on happy hour (well vodka) cost me $4, which is right where it should be.) Also made a return trip on a Saturday night, to get a feel for the weekend crowd. Not too bad, but mildly disappointed. I was hoping it would remain a little more of the chill day-time vibe, but come 10pm the music gets cranked up, and my group decided to move on to a place where we could actually have conversation without screaming.  (sidenote: every bartender / waitress I've dealt with here has been really, super nice.) Def. worth a shot I'd say, and I could see it being a fave HH place."
4,"This place is a very chill wine bar. Came here after flying in for work and wanted something that would be light, have a good wine selection, and a nice outdoor patio/bar area. Daily Dose fulfills each of those items.  You MUST get the bruchetta plate."
4,"As I revealed in a previous review, my family loves InnSuites. This location is nestled in the Squaw Peak Mountain Preserve, close to the prestigious Biltmore area, and offers easy access to downtown Phoenix, Scottsdale and the Camelback corporate corridor.  InnSuites offers comfotable, clean rooms for a very rasonable price. And as with all of the InnSuites locations, the Northern location includes amenities such as free social hour and free hot breakfast with eggs, potatoes, waffles, toast, cereal, yogurt, fruit, coffee, milk & juices. There isn't really much within walking distance at this location, so either plan to hang around the pool a lot or you'll need to have a car."
5,"Alas...I've given up the idea of writing a review for a place if it isn't at least 4 stars. Sue me; I'm in the industry.  Fuego Bistro is by far one of the best places I've been to recently. I was introduced to it this last weekend on a date. Ironically, it's super close to my house yet I've never heard of it. When we were arriving, I was a little curious to see where the hell he was taking me since there aren't any signs really and it's pretty hidden. Once we were inside, though, it was like finding a little treasure. The patio is welcoming & even though we didn't have a reservation (aka we couldn't sit outside) we snagged a table close enough to enjoy the beautiful weather.  We started off with a round of mojitos and even though it's been a few years since they've won best mojito...I can say the Prickly Pear was the best I've had in a while. The Ahi Tostadas followed & they were awesome...the sauce added a kick to it & it was a perfect start to the meal. After, we shared the Fuego Pasta with chorizo, chicken, mushrooms, peppers, & a chipotle cream sauce...huge! What I did eat of it was delicious. My favorite (and my date's I'm fairly certain) was the special...an herb crusted Mahi Mahi with a pineapple sauce, home-made cornbread, & chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes. Amazing. Even though the Mahi Mahi might be hard to come by if you visit, the two sides aren't & are so good, I'm droolin' just thinking about it. :) Dessert? Try the banana burrito. Heaven on the tongue! Kevin was an excellent server which just highlights the night. It's hard to have a great meal without great service but he provided just that. If you're in the area...check it out. If you aren't...check it out. I'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed."
5,"Great service, great food, highly recommend.  We had the scollops and they were to die for, the scotch beef and mac and cheese were also amazing.  Will definitely go back and recommend to friends."
1,"Love the idea - vegan Mexican. Have tried to eat there twice. Both times checked their FB page for hours, both times they were closed. Called their phone number, no one answered. No sign, no explanation on FB. Pathetic."
4,"Very good food.  Our service was great--thank you, Heather.  She guided us to some good wines and food recommendations.  We'll be back"
4,"Prolly one of the best and definetly one of the better Chinese places in town. they deliver pretty late which is always convienent and have the best house fried rice, wonton soup, beef lo mein, and their honey walnut shrimp is average. The white rice tends to be a bit dry, but overall they have always been pretty nice, and always throw in free crab puffs for free when you order over a certain amount. Definetly the go to place for fair priced, yummy Chinese food!"
3,"So, I'll admit that I'm a ***bertos addict...I truly crave this food and I'm not really sure why.  My mom says that she ate nachos w/ jalepenos on a regular basis while pregnant with me.  Maybe that explains it.  Anyway, I've been wanting to try this place forever since they claim to have ""the best tortillas in town.""  I seized the opportunity to check it out since I had to drop a friend off at the airport this morning.    The exterior certainly leaves a lot to be desired, and the ambiance is about on par with the drunk tank at the fourth avenue jail (a good friend spent a most unfortunate night here and described it in detail).  The cold, stained cement floors, nasty old booths and 70's McDonald's style swivel plastic chairs which likely  needed a new coat of paint back in the early 80's.  I decided on a green chile burrito and my companion ordered the egg/chorizo/potato/cheese burrito.  After waiting for about 5-10 minutes, our number was called.  The first thing I noticed was that the burritos were quite small.   I knew, however, that I was in for a real treat with the piping hot, super chewy freshly made tortilla, and I was not disappointed.  The green chile, while tasty, had too much liquid and after inadvertantly puncturing my tortilla, I was left with a handful of sauce.   I certainly felt more than safe inside this place (despite the somewhat scary clientele) based on the table of twelve Phoenix police officers sitting across from us.  Overall, I would give the atmosphere 1.5 stars, and the food 3.75 stars.   It was definitely different than what I'm used to, and it gave me a small taste of the cultural melting pot known as South Phoenix."
5,"After eating chocolate covered bacon for desert (yeah, that's really one of the options for desert), I say that I was completely stratified with Beckett's Table. From the moment I called to make a reservation I knew that this restaurant was going to have great staff and service. The staff greeted us at the entrance and give us options for seating. I was VERY pleased with the pricing on the menu especially the wine bottle prices! It's just a matter of time, and I will be back for an evening meal! Speaking from living in the Arcadia area, this is just the restaurant we need in the area--a nice community restaurant with pleasing food! If you are looking for a nice dining experience, this is the place for you!"
4,"The best burgers in town at a fast food restaurant. Cajun fries are tasty too. They have the coolest soda dispenser at this location. Hey, I never knew they had Orange and Rasberry Diet Coke."
5,"Love this place! A must stop for anyone downtown needing a snack or a drink! Very good happy hour and unbelievable flavor combinations. On my last visit, I was pleased to try some happy hour toasts and fish and chips. Zero disappointment."
5,"This is not an Asian Topless Bar. It is an Asian ""Tapas"" bar. The guys I was traveling with spent the first ten minutes waiting for the show to start and were disappointed when I smacked them all for actually thinking I would take my coworkers to a topless bar.  ""Tapas"" are little appetizer plates, and Sens is all about getting a little taste of everything. The atmosphere is fantastic - eclectic, moody and very, very cozy (so I recommend reservations).  The little dishes are about four single servings, so you'll want to order several plates! Highly recommend the volcano flamed beef and the sugar cane pork. The food is very flavorful -- but everything is a bit spicy (garlicky-spicy), even the dishes they call ""mild.""  Plates run about $6-$9 each, and each person in our party ordered 3 or 4 plates...we were all full by the time we left! Definitely get a cocktail, their mixed drink menu is fab (White Sin is absolutely sinful...and absolutely worth the indulgence)."
5,"These little sliders are tasty, delicious and pretty speedy.  You get two and you can get them with or without grilled onions.  There is a home made type thousand island dressing on them that adds so much to these wonderous burgers!   Fries are 5 star as well...also enjoy the people watching...Scottsdale at its finest!"
4,"Thanks to Fry's, I felt like I was on vacation today as I traipsed around in the rainforest with the Aztec computer geeks.  There's something just cool about walking into a snake's maw to listen to stereo equipment.  The outside is just as lovely to look at. Now as far as the store itself... ...the cafe was a joke - out of cream cheese for their bagels.  Who runs out of cream cheese by 10am on a Saturday?  Coffee machine broken...don't they sell those things?  Couldn't they just 'demo' one from off the shelf? ...it felt like at least half of the workers knew what they were talking about - which is actually (maybe even sadly) better than some electronics stores I've been to.  They didn't try to talk down to me because I was young or a girl. ...prices were cheaper for some of the items I looked at ...no restocking fee for returned electronics. So in the end, the unique look of the store boosted it up to a four, silly enough as that sounds.  It was refreshing to be in there, and my bullsh*t radar didn't go off as loudly as it did when I was in the Baseline location.  Good thing I wasn't rating just the cafe, they would've gotten a two."
4,"One of the best lunches I've had in Phoenix. I'm still thinking about the fried egg sandwich and fries. A fried egg- yolk just barely runny. Barely. Two thick-ass slabs of good-ass, smoky-ass bacon. Arugula and aioli on a really tasty ass bun. Damn, son. Good as hell. The french fries were so damn good, too, and you have to dip those in the remoulade to really enjoy them all the way.  I would come back for this sammich every day if I lived next door. Don't be afraid of it being called a fried egg sammich, because it's a whole nother level."
4,"I really like this place! I've been wanting something like this to open for years, and now it's right around he corner! I'm a huge sushi fan, but I rarely have enough time during the week to stop and get any... Until now! This place is exactly what you'd hope for in a fast food sushi joint- helpful, friendly staff, good variety, good prices, and a clean dining space. I admit the whole make your own thing can be a little intimidating at first, just order one of their features rolls to get yourself started, then take off the training wheels on your next visit. You pick white or brown rice, meats, up to three veggies, and whatever sauces you want. The possibilities are endless! I've eaten enough sushi to know generally what works together, so I've been pretty happy with what I've come up with so far. The rolls are tasty and filling, and their traditional sides are great if you're super hungry. The only complaints I have are that the fish can be a little bland (even the so called 'spicy'), so you pretty much need to add a sauce of some kind. And some slices of fresh jalapeño! The parking lot is also a nightmare during weekday lunch hour, but I still think its worth it."
4,"Sit at the bar, order tacos and sangria. you will not be disappointed.* *you might be disappointed if you do not like techno music and a wide variety of alternative relationships being showcased around you. If you like to eat/drink and have a little social interaction and have an open mind, then this place is for you."
5,"what is it with me and pricey phoenix hotels? i swear i don't just give out fives willy nilly or do i have any particular adoration for phoenix.  (sorry phx.)  I went to the Valley Ho on an amazing business trip that involved rock stars and the Oakland Athletics, which happen to be my favorite team. it was downright magical.  the decor was fantastic, the rooms were huge, with huge tubs, a poolside patio and a comfy chaise lounge. the flatscreen TV had an iPod doc! yaaaaay! (why don't more hotels do this?)  the pool was phenomenal. i sat around for days on couches drinking bloody mary's and frozen drinks. the lobby bar had a deadly but wonderful drink called the stardust.  The trader vic's attached isn't so hot, but i generally liked all the food i got from the pool bar and the restaurant ZuZus. (room service too- they make their own english muffins!!!) If i'm comparing it to the royal palms, the other phoenix resort i raved about, it's tough. Royal Palms is better for chilling and families; Valley Ho is better for singles. Royal Palms is your wedding; Valley Ho the bachelorette party. Valley Ho had better food and more style, but Royal Palms had a bit more to it and better service. Really, you can't go wrong with either.  What is it about Phoenix hotels??? all i know is i am no longer groaning when i'm sent on a business trip there!"
1,"After repeat visits it just gets worse - the service, that is.  It was as if we were held hostage and could not leave for a full 25 minutes because that's how long it took to receive hour check after several requests to several different employees.  Female servers might be somewhat cute but know absolutely nothing about beer and this is a brewpub.  I asked if they have an seasonal beers and the reply was no, that they only sell their own beers!  Even more amusing is their ""industrial pale ale"" is an IPA but it is not bitter.  So, they say it's an IPA but it's not bitter, it's not a true-to-style IPA.  Then people say ""Oh I don't like IPA's"" and want something else.  Their attempt to rename a beer/style is actually hurting them.  Amazing. The menu was not the regular menu, just a small list of about 4-5 choices.  To make it worse, the actual menu on every table was wrong, yet the kept the menus on the tables anyway.  I heard 3 separate tables order the fried raviolis but they did not have them.   This place is *only* in business because of the location, location, location."
2,"Returned here after a year's absense. I understand they have had a change in management. some for the better, some for the worse. new general manager and now the service seems much friendlyer and efficient. New chef and now food is slow to arrive and not as good as it used to be. steak was charred, mashed potatos were lukewarm. Took over 30 minutes for our food to arrive. hopefully it was just an off night for the kitchen. but the general feel was that they lost the attention to the little details"
5,"NOTE:  I only had take-out, and it was brought to me by my boss.  She rules! She got me a hummus/grilled/marinated chicken combo.  It has 3 different hummus...es...es (HA!): roasted red pepper, jalapeno and plain ole' hummus.  They are sectioned off in the big plastic container, which rules for my OCD, as I don't like my food touching.  In the center is a PILE (a total monton!) of grilled chicken.  It's got some sort or spicy rub on it, but not too much kick.  It had been marinated, too.  And tender....I think this is the most tender chicken I have ever had.  It made my own tender spots as juicy as the chicken was! I'm not big on pita, so instead she got me a side of cukes.   This thing weighs a ton and I've been eating it for 2 hours.  I have made a mess in my ""Make me Yelp"" boyshorts."
5,My car looks better than it did the day I bought it!
1,"I learned of this company through a living social deal. I emailed them to set up an appointment. The earliest available date was a month later, I went ahead and scheduled the appointment in spite of the wait time. One month went by,  on the scheduled day of cleaning in which I was told they would arrive between 12 and 1... NO ONE shows up. I wait, at 3:30 I email asking why was this scheduled appointment not kept?... I've yet to get a response or an explanation. There are many cleaning companies out there, my suggestion - try a different one than Maid 4 it all."
5,"We were here on Wednesday, 12/21/11. We had been at a Rubios in CA recently and was extremely disappointed. Not this time! Jacob was our order taker and was VERY courteous and professional.  My husband got two fish tacos that were a good size and yummie. I went with the grilled veggie burrito and man, it was huge and tasty! This is what Rubios is about!"
2,"One of these days I will learn NOT to take out of town guests to places I haven't tried first.   I was pretty excited for one of my favorite people to come and visit.  Her only request?  Sushi!  While I have my list of absolute AZ favorites (Tokyo Lobby, Toyama, Sakana, Hiro, Dozo) foolishly I decided we should try somewhere new.  Having read many good things about Hana, the choice was made. Walking into the BYOB place with our Kirin Ichiban in hand, we were ready for a great evening.  Too bad that isn't what we experienced.  After being ignored for a few minutes by everyone who passed by and even the person behind the counter, I found someone to tell that there were two of us and we would like to sit at the sushi bar.  Although there were spots open, we were left standing there for quite a while.  Do you want to stand around holding a 6-pack and not even be offered a bottle opener?  Me neither.  Once we were finally seated, we weren't told about any specials, offered water or even glasses for our beer.   Deciding to make the best of it, we ordered: Yellowtail sashimi (good, the best item we had) Spicy scallop nigiri (good) Albacore sashimi (dry, not sliced through, leaving us top pick off overcooked bits and pieces) Freshwater eel nigiri (dry and crumbly rice, falling apart at the touch) Scallop dynamite ($15+ for 'krab'?  Really?) The female sushi chef was nice but our waitress was nonexistent.  Other tables and customers at the sushi bar seemed to be getting decent service (water, getting their beer/wine/whatever from the refrigerator) but we were left without water refills (once we finally got any at all) and don't even think about getting another of those BYOB beers we brought.  It even took a while to get the unused bottles back when we were trying to leave.  Lackluster food and nonexistent service at a premium price.  No thanks."
4,"I cannot speak for the food, (though the menu looked unique and tantalizing), but the beer selection was great, as was service. We arrived on Saturday night, the first weekend Angels Trumpet was open, around 10 p.m. for drinks. There was a large group of us, 9 people... though there weren't any tables to accomodate our party we were able to stand/be seated comfortably around one of the high-tops. This place is great for smaller parties who enjoy a good beer. The selection cannot be beat in downtown Phoenix -- 31 craft brews on tap of every taste and style... and they're always rotating. I had the Biere Blonde & White... 4.5% alcohol, light, sunny taste. Reminded me of Four Peak's SunBrew. The selection ranges from hoppy IPAs at 10% alcohol/volume to the lighter, summer brews and everything in between. There is literally something for everyone, even a few wines on tap for the non-beer drinkers. Our server was very nice and accommodating.. and though the place was packed she got us our drinks pretty quickly. A couple reasons I didn't give Angels Trumpet the perfect '5' star rating: Disorganization-- Seating was sort of a nightmare... and we kind of waited around for one of the high-tops to open up and just snagged it. Ambience-- I enjoyed the nice, open floor plan but the restaurant-style and dozens of tables/chairs was a bit puzzling considering the kitchen was closed when we arrived. I couldn't hear any music above the conversations in the room and the huge, 60"" TV screens weren't turned on. It'd be nice for weekend nights to boast something a little more special. If you're going to close the kitchen, allow people to walk around and mingle more. Overall, if you're looking for a nice place to kick back with a small group of friends and try some awesome, unique beers on tap, Angels Trumpet is it. Their prices are reasonable for the quality offered. Haven't tried the food, but the menu is pretty diverse offering a spin on traditional bar food like flatbread pizzas and sandwiches."
4,"Talk about options!  It's almost unfair to have so many items on a menu.   Especially when the food is so good.  I have gone to the Cheesecake Factory several times and have not been able to even put a dent in the menu. So, I wasn't too hungry this time, so I decided to order from the small plates menu.  We started with the corn fritters.  Then I ordered the shrimp and grits and my husband ordered the hibachi steak.   The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because we didn't get our appetizer until the our food was ready.  And by that time, we had already stuffed our faces with bread and butter (which is delicious)!  The server apologized for delay in bringing our app and the manager came by and didn't charge us for the corn fritters.  That was much appreciated!  We only had one of the fritters since our other dishes were in front of us and we didn't want those to get cold.   I really like the shrimp and grits.  I think the dish came with a little too much sauce...but that's just me....I just really liked the taste of the cheddar grits.  My husbands steak was really really good!  The hibachi steak is what I normally ordered.  I will go back again!"
4,"Coming from a place where there is mexican food on every couple streets, I have truly missed an authentic mexican restaurant or joint. This place is legit! Good tacos, good burritos, real good non-taco bell mexican!  If you want some real Mexican food, try this place out!"
5,"I love love LOVE this place. My boss (who is into healthy eating) recommended this place. I went over with some highly skeptical friends and one dinner was enough to convert them into believers! The food here is so good! We had the Shrimp dumplings and the Onion tart as starters. We ordered the Shirataki noodles and street tacos as entrees. So also ordered the Kale-aid. All of the dishes were yummy.  I have gone back many times since then and have never been disappointed! I have gone after yoga to get some Kale salad or the chicken chopped salad. I always have to get the Kale aid.  Once, a guy at the next table, uprooted a whole plant by mistake (on the patio) and was highly embarrassed as was his date! Ever since, I have very careful not to throw my arms around as I can be quite clumsy sometimes! I do NOT want to be banned from my favorite place for my clumsiness! I don't think I can live without True Food!"
5,Terrific food and service. Happy hour from 3-6 is totally worth it for the free children's meals and half price drinks. The french onion burger is delicious!
4,"After SMOCA opening night, I just wanted to relax with some friends and not go get wasted or have to wait a long time to get a seat at a trendy bar on a Friday night. Oh yeah, and get something to eat. I had remembered some generally good reviews of Drift, had noticed it when going to shows at Martini Ranch, and really wanted something with coconut (?). After a terrifying short-cut with a walking GPS that I was sure was leading us to our death (or at least led us to dog-shit on the sidewalk at one point), we ended up here with a nice enough door guy. Inside I was really impressed. It was a lot nicer than I thought it would be, more sophisticated and while it was Tiki-themed, I thought it was very tongue in cheek COOL interpretation of tiki (very hard to pull off).  We asked for a booth and got one near the door (which lead to superior people watching later). Our booth was creamy, spacious, left us with no ass swamp, (although the acoustics were a little bad-I had trouble hearing someone two people away) and showed us more intimate tables in very Ikea-esqe and mod black leather. This place is surprisingly classy. The giant aquarium at the bar was goregous and if I ended up here with one other person, I would def. sit there. Our waitstaff was extremely sweet, the food (veggie spring rolls, coconut shrimp, and pot stickers) were not that expensive (5-8) and surprisingly good. Kristin and I got two orders of spring rolls. We took the longest time deciding drinks-I got the old fashioned Pina Colada in a coconut shell (YUM) and Erica got the Evil Bastard which was set on fire and it was damn potent. I was very giggly the rest of the night.  Looking around, this WAS not a pick up scence. Groups of friends just sat around chatting. On the way to the bathrooms, a small open lounge was dominated by one party having a lot of fun. The bathroom sink blew my mind and I still don't know what sets it off...although my theory is some dude needs to flush the toilet for water to come down and vice versa. I started freaking out in my drunky state, saying ""I have soapy hands goddamit! And I'm smart! How does this shit turn on!"" wiping my hands on the sink with tiny amounts of water. Overall, a very chill scene with a bizarre assortment of people (bro dogs, homely couples, musicians, barbies, and just regular folks) perfect for a second or third date for a casually romantic drink or two."
4,"Great outdoor patio, couches, big bar, tables, great burgers, huge side of crunchy fries and they carry sweet tea vodka.  Do not order the sangria, unless you like it super sweet. I don't, I'm sweet enough already."
4,"It's rare that I have a date with my husband on a Monday afternoon/evening, but this past Memorial Day, we did just that.  After a quick visit to the Science Center (the Van Gogh alive exhibit is a must-see by the way), we were hungry so we headed over to Rice Paper.  Neither of us had ever been before, and we were pleased with our experience. It was a tad bit too hot to sit outside, although they do have a covered patio with misters.  We walked in and were seated and greeted promptly by Al, our server.  He's quite the character.  He made us laugh quite a bit in addition to being attentive and making some recommendations.  We enjoyed the stylish renovated house / hip colorful atmosphere as well. We ended up ordering a few things and sharing.  Highlights included the firecracker shrimp. a spider roll, a shrimp roll, and a zen salad.  Everything was light and tasted fresh.  We really enjoyed the dipping sauces that came with the spring rolls.  They've got such a huge selection of the spring rolls, that I can't wait to return to try some of the others.  They don't have a huge selection of Vietnamese entrees, but it appears that they will custom create a bit upon request. I highly recommend going for the ""food happy hour.""  It's from 3pm - 6:30pm and includes $6 appetizers & $1 off all spring rolls.  Such a deal!  We didn't take advantage of it, but the ""drinks happy hour"" is actually 11am - 6:30pm and specialty drinks are $6, house wine by the glass is $5, well drinks are $4, and draft beer is just $2.75. If only Rice Paper was a tad bit closer to home, I could see myself being a regular... Instead, I'll keep it high on my list of spots to return to when I find myself heading downtown!"
5,"Oh AJ's...  How do I love thee...  Let me count the ways (BEERS)... 1...2...3...200! They have so many different beers to choose from here.  If you ever need an ingredient that is out of the norm they will have it.  If you ever need an ingredient for a special dinner that MUST be fresh and ripe, this is the place. From 10 differnt types of flower, 15 different brands of pasta, to 20 different types of EVOO, if you're making a really great dinner, spend the extra couple of bucks and get your stuff here. One day I'll be able to afford the prime steaks."
3,"Honestly, I love cupcakes. Like I said in my Wicked Bakery review, eating a cupcake, unlike a slice of cake, gives one a sense of accomplishment. I like cupcakes. I like the sense of accomplishment you get from eating a cupcake. You may have had a hard day, but you finished an entire cupcake. That's validation. It makes me happy. Sprinkles is a great place to go for a sugar fix, but I have to say there are some negatives. I have had a dry cupcake there. They are a bit on the expensive side. The worst sin of all? Their red velvet is ""a southern style light chocolate cake with a cream cheese frosting"". I have to disagree. I don't detect any cream cheese flavor in that frosting. The first time I devoured a Sprinkles cupcake it was magical. I was particularly impressed with the black and white- ""Belgian dark chocolate with creamy vanilla frosting"". I was in a shoebox Los Angeles apartment and the cupcakes seemed of adequate size. The next time was the new location  am currently reviewing and they were consumed in a larger-than-shoebox Chandler house. They seemed a little small. The third time was in my car- a Subaru Baja, and the cupcakes, again seemed sizable. I'd have to think that consuming a Sprinkles cupcake in an SUV would not be a great idea- the cupcake to eating space ratio would be all off.  For true cupcake validation, I'll drive the 35.9 miles to Wicked. Ok- you caught me. I might stop by for an emergency fix if I happen to be in the area, but I'll be thinking of Slade at Wicked... and I'll be consuming my confection in a small space."
4,I do not eat fast food.  i do eat at in-n-out.  mmmm double double animal style
4,"Very nice, classy decor all around, cleaner than most places I've seen. Seems like a place you'd wanna dress up for. Drinks could be a little cheaper ($9 a shot), but I figure it's Scottsdale, so whatevs.. Music ranges anywhere from old school hip hop to top 40's music you hear straight from the radio. No cover, so that's always a plus."
1,"MY EXPECTATIONS WERE EXCEEDED!  I've been searching for so long to have a dinner experience that MET all of my expectations - for a restaurant that I SHOULD NEVER PATRONIZE.  Mimi's in Goodyear actually exceeded my expectations.  On Oct 26th, while visiting the area, I made the unfortunate mistake of recommending we dine at Mimi's because of previously good food and service there.  But, alas, if the old Mimi's quality still existed, they wouldn't have exceeded my expectations for WHAT NOT to experience in a restaurant. Let me recant why YOU or ANY ONE ELSE (except those people you truly dislike) should never patronize this facility.  First of all, the interior temperature was at least 80 degrees (when it was less than 65 outside).  We had to ask for the air conditioning to be turned on. Next, we ordered the artichoke dip appetizer.  It looked funny.  It tasted funny.  The tortilla chips actually resembled pita chips.  If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it must be a ______. I ordered the chicken cordon bleu which is supposed to be served with ""seasonal vegetables"" and ""homemade mashed potatoes"".  Can someone explain to me how MIXED seasonal vegetables can be served where the brocolli is steaming hot, but the carrots mixed with them are literally still frozen in the middle?  That's a feat.  My ""homemade"" mashed potatoes?  Cold.  A sliver of butter placed on top of the mashed potatoes would not even melt to graphically show our waitress ""the problem"" .  Even after this effort, no offer from the wait staff (or manager-missing-in-action) was ever made to either warm up the potatoes, replace them ......or, perhaps, use them as wall spackling. After all this, they sincerely asked us if ""everything was all right"" and ""would we care to order dessert"".  At least they have a sense of humor. Never again."
4,Fun place for breakfast.  Prices were reasonable and food was good.
5,"I love this place. It is one of my favorite Antique shops in the city! There is a wide selection and variety of booths and items. There is everything here from match boxes, cute purses and hats to retro/vintage furniture, wacky mannequins, old cameras and old toys to reminiscence over. And! They are decently priced and have a nice helpful staff."
3,"I ordered the Peanut Panang Chicken.... I rqstd to the waitress that I wanted extra Bell Pepper. When it came, it had -NO- Bell Peppers at all.... i actually didn't realize this until about 5 mins into eating it. could not find our waitress, I waited about 7 mins, finally, I had to get up & search for her. I found another waiter & told him my problem. He took my Dish, but then came back to tell me that they are ""All out of Green Bell Peppers. Would I like Red Bell Peppers"". I said yes, of course.  This whole experience has put a sour taste in my mouth about this place, which is next door to the 'mediocre' Good Egg on Central.   I like Wild Thaiger on Central MUCH better instead!"
4,"This is quite possibly the best hamburger on the planet.  I live for In-N-Out Burger when I head West and I was impressed by the friendliness of the staff and speed with which my order was processed during a busy Thursday evening. I'd give this location 5 stars (and if I were rating the burger and service alone, it's no contest), but I was disappointed by the fries.  They didn't taste as fresh as usual.  That said, they weren't stale or frozen, so they beat every other fast food chain. I'd certainly go back since my Double Double without, with pickles, sliced chilis, and extra spread was AMAZING. Be aware: they do not accept American Express, but Visa and Mastercard are just fine."
5,"We tried this last night for our date night.  We were impressed.  The waitress was amazing in explaining the menu and making suggestions. This is a great place to relax and talk.  The food was great.  I had the Tartiflette...WOW it was so good.  My husband had the La Potence, which is their speciality.  He thought it was great...We will be back..."
1,"This was by far the worst restaurant experience I've ever had.  I paid $20.00 for a show and dinner. I received the show only because it was from an outside source. The show was 2 hours long and by the time it was over half the restaurant I'd say 50 to 80 people still had not been served. They didn't have enough menu's for people to even order off of. Some guy in shorts walked around with buckets of silverware wiping them on his shorts then placing them on the table. The show started at 7:00, at 9:30 I still had no food. The people who did get food complained that it was terrible. Maybe I should be happy I didn't get any food. When I asked again about our order the waitress said she would take care of it. The guys in the kitchen were overheard saying ""f---k those people no more orders! not only did we not get the dinner we already paid for they flat out refused to give us dinner or our money back. We ended up at Dennys eating eggs at 11:00 . Seriously I've never had such a bad experience in my life. Can you imagine paying for a dinner then being refused the dinner or a refund? unbelievable"
5,"This review pertains to carnitas, and as such should not be taken as a suggestion for ordering any of the following: fish tacos, rice, beans, horchata. That's about it! Yum!"
1,"I purchased the Enotria groupon when it was released last year and had a horrible experience at the restaurant. 1) I ordered a cheese platter. The platter was very much overpriced at over $18.00. The most problematic thing is that Enotria ordered the food from another restaurant on Mayo Blvd and had it delivered to them. The same is true with Pizza. If you order pizza there, it will be delivered from another restaurant in the Mayo shopping plaza. Enotria is taking a significant markup on the food because they are paying another vendor for it. AVOID THIS!! 2) Another disturbing aspect of the visit was that we were served disproportionately small portion because we were using a groupon. We ordered two glasses of red wine. The waiter (who also happened to be the owner) served us a glass that was 1/3 of what is typically served. The only positive aspect of Enotria is that they have a good selection of wines. To be sincere, you are much better off going to a more reputable establishment in the area like White Chocolate Grill. Oh, also keep in mind that the current owner bought the restaurant over a year ago. It has changed ownership several times and the overall quality is suffering because of this. AVOID."
4,Huge burritos for $7. Enough for 2 people.  Fresh and tasty!  Plus very friendly service.  I prefer going here vs the Taco Bell in front of them :)
4,"It appears that the service kinks have been worked out as our server was very attentive and the food came out quickly. Guacamole was tasty and fun and tacos were innovative and delicious. I don't want to argue the point of whether Barrio Queen aspires to be authentic street food or Mexican fusion, consensus at our table was that it's a bit of both and the experience was so pleasant that honestly we don't care and we will return soon.  Of note, automatic chips and salsa at the beginning of the meal would be a nice touch and more opportunities to add serious heat (habanero, serrano, jalapeno) would have been a wonderful adjunct."
3,"I went in yesterday for happy hour to have a birthday drink. I had the house margarita for $5.75. Actually I had two! They were good. I think I disappointed the bartender when I question him why his $7.25 Margarita he was pushing was supposedly so awesome. He claimed Cruz a local Tequila was the reason. I argued just because it's local doesn't make it good. LOL.  The house Rita stands up alone, as a good traditional Rita on the rocks. Don't buy the hype, as I saw half the crowd not question it and accept the pricier one on special as the way to go.  The place was busy. They were also hosting a MBA networking mixer just off the main bar. In addition to discounted beer at happy hour they also offered free food! I thought those days were gone but they kept a steady supply of warm chips, salsa, veggie tray, cold pinwheel wraps and one or two hot Mexican items (mini chimis, and bean & cheese nachos) coming. I was going to order a half price appetizer as part of my happy hour, but heck I went for the free food and was just fine.  My sampling of the appetizers makes me wonder how good the menu was, so I peeked at it. It looks pretty basic but tasty. I think everything was $12 or less on the dinner menu. According to the sign outside lunch starts at $5.99.  It may be commercialized Mexican food but it's a step up from some places like Taco Bell and Baja Express for certain. The staff seemed competent and to work rather well together. Even though it was busy the staff was calm and quick to serve, which is a good thing. They seem to recognize some customers as regular patrons which was also nice.  The woman's room off the bar was fresh and clean in this madness as was the bar and all areas I could see.  I think I will be back. I think I could even become a fan of the place over time. It seems to have a good mix of people and an impressive straight male clientele, worth another look."
4,"this place is growing on me. i wasn't a big fan at the beginning thinking they cater to the yuppy crowd that wants to be seen. i still think that's the case, but i think people truly go for the atmosphere and good food. the vig cobb is really tasty and you just can't go wrong with sweet potato fries...my weakness! the interior is really cool and creative and the vibe is casual and friendly. lunch hour tends to get a little busy, but they have a decent amount of seating for such a small place."
5,"Well what can I say about this place?  The restaurant is located in an upscale commercial complex with boutiques and an AJ's in the middle of Arrowhead Ranch.  Definitely doesn't have the boring suburban feel which you get along Bell Road only a mile away.  The inside has exposed brick on the walls with sleek looking seating.  Each food item comes out looking like a self made creation from the chef.  I have to say the Marguerite pizza is one of my favorites.  Having a crispy crust and savory flavors that make my mouth want to eat more, more, and more.  But I don't need to eat more because I fill my mouth with a good wine.  I had  a Dutton Estate Chardonnay(I think) which was half off on this day which kept me happy.  This place did not fail me. So will I be back?  Umm that's a yes!"
4,"Good drinks, great food, and cool music. There is a stage right behind the bar. We tried the Fingerling Potatoes in Tomato Jam and it was fantastic.. I recommend."
4,"Why did I stop coming going to Pro Ten Nail Shop? They are located very close to where I work and I used to go to this shop all the time, they do a great job on pedicures! I got what would be called a deluxe pedicure with designs on my toes for only $27 bucks!!! Can you believe that!! They have signs all over asking for the customer's to pay in cash, that why they can offer us the lower prices! I am more than ok with paying in cash and my toes are looking cute! I think I am on my way to becoming a regular again for sure!"
4,"Another fox restaurant concept-- healthy and simple. I liked going here, the service was great but the portions were kinda small and most of the patrons were really ugly. I did have something pretty amazing there-- a marscapone creamed corn-- it was awesome!"
3,"Alright, so here is my two cents on Brat Haus. I suggest to steer clear of the brats I tried (Beer Brat & Spicy Thai).  I found them a bit dry and bland.  I also found the pretzels less than fabulous. I do suggest to try to big, juicy, tasty, meatballs. Much better choice. The outside patio very cool, an open fresh space with plenty of seating and a big ol' wall of funky art. The service was also friendly, and attentive and fair prices. Overall, it's totally worth checking out if you are in the area and in the mood for something different."
3,Kimchi - 5 stars. Other side dishes - OK. there is no date on it so I really don't know how fresh they are. I went there couple times to get side dishes other than Kimchi. it was not as good as Paldo. I only go to Seoul Market for Kimchi now.
2,"We came here on a Friday night. My husband ordered a dirty martini and it was so dirty, it came out looking like a glass of olive juice with some grenadine in it - it was actually red - WTH? It was the first time in his life he had sent something back. The waitress was cool about it though. She had to be, she has eyeballs too. We ordered the mozzarella and heirloom tomato appetizer. It was ok, nothing special. I have a pet peeve though - if you say heirloom, I expect heirloom and heirloom tomatoes, they were not. If they are not in season, that's fine, but tell people when they order. Then, we had the cannelloni special with sausage sauce. Again, nothing special. Here's the kicker - they charge for bread (not special bread, just plain ol' bread) and for parmesan cheese to put on top of your pasta!!! In fairness, they do give you one piece of bread with your pasta, but if you want any more, you are paying $3. Let's be serious - the name of the restaurant is Pasta Bar and you charge for grated cheese?? That's like going to a sushi restaurant and paying for soy sauce or a burger place and paying for ketchup. The cheese actually on the menu as a side. Are you kidding me? We're not talking special grated cheese. It looked like the stuff from a green shaker bottle. I wanted to add some salt to our appetizer, but there was none on the table. I didn't ask for any because I was afraid they'd charge for that too. I'm actually surprised they didn't have it on the menu as a side. We won't be going back."
4,"I love this store for years now. I discovered it here. The candles are wonderful. I love the little travel sampler kit.  The yuzu bergamot moisturizer is great.  I enjoy the soaps.  This is the type of store that you just go for the product and know it is just going to cost more. Honestly it is not the much for many items: The little kits like the: - cranberry orange body wash 2 oz - cranberry orange moisturizer 2 oz - mint thyme body wash 2 oz - mint thyme moisturizer 2 oz - bamboo creme body wash 2 oz - bamboo creme moisturizer 2 oz - packaged in a reusable zippered bag all for 25 bucks.   clove soap 2 oz - honey almond soap 2 oz - lavender lime soap 2 oz - lemongrass soap 2 oz - oatmeal lavender soap 2 oz  - rosemary soap 2 oz  - rosemary & peppermint soap 2 oz - rose tangerine lavender soap 2 oz - seven seed lemon & rosemary soap 2 oz - vetivert & grapefruit soap 2 oz - wild mint soap 2 oz  - yuzu soap 2 oz for 38 bucks. - bamboo creme moisturizer 2 oz  - mint thyme moisturizer 2 oz  - lavender lime moisturizer 2 oz  - yuzu bergamot moisturizer 2 oz  - cranberry orange moisturizer 2 oz  - sweet almond & sea kelp moisturizer 2 oz  - zippered travel bag  for 25 bucks.. Why yes you just read my Stocking stuffers for myself that I just sent my husband. hehe :D   Worth trying. You will find a favorite.  Quality of their ingredients from their website: ""...using only pure essential oils, vitamins and antioxidants, and rare fruits and herbs - and never using synthetic fragrances or colors. Now, we're also sourcing organic ingredients when possible, and are on track to have all of our products be paraben-free and SLS/ALS-free by mid-2010. "" Service: She was very nice and was even happier when she saw I was a little shop happy when I started putting everything on the counter. hehe. From St. Louis and loved it! TLDR:  The products are a favorite of mine. Good products and good service at this location. Great outdoor mall."
4,"I know its gonna sound a bit foolish when I divulge that I was actually a bit scared to enter the Roadrunner Lounge, but the truth is that I was.  Due to its lack of windows and barebones facade, I concluded that this bar had the possibility of being the sort of place where, when I opened the door, I might bare witness to a mob boss or two trying to decide what they should do with the man they just shot...  but that wasn't the case. What I discovered was a long corridor flanked by mirrored walls and strings of multicolored lights, as well as ample seating and classic video games to boot.  The games included PacMan and Golden Tee, accompanied by a dartboard and a pool table - enough to keep the gamer in any of us busy for at least a few hours of drink-sippin. The drinks were cheap and strong, and the tunes were decent - however the digital jukebox put a frown on my face; I hoped for a Wurlitzer.  Our barkeep was friendly and efficient, and our drinks were strong and low-priced.  I think tap beer's only two bucks, and mixers aren't too much more. In conclusion, the next time you're feeling a bit nostalgic, and you're looking for a watering hole off the beaten path, kick a few back at the Roadrunner.  Bottom's up!"
2,"As a breakfast snob I really do not like Denny's.  They don't really do anything especially well.  Also, I've had inconsistent quality of food and helpfulness of staff on different occasions.  I can't slam this place for one unpleasant waitress, but I can for those inconsistencies and that fact that there are just so many other places that do what they do better. In fact, this place was the very last Denny's I ever ate.  The food took forever, it wasn't well done, came out all screwed up, and the waitress was unpleasant.  After that experience I decided to never set foot in another Denny's."
4,"Great meal all-around.  Was hoping for an authentic experience...and that is what we received from start to finish.  Really enjoyed the grilled lamb and chicken, with garlic sauce on the side, and a Turkish coffee to finish. Service was attentive and friendly.  The staff was clearly proud of their food/restaurant, as they should be... Highly recommend!"
3,I am not the biggest fan of fast food ever. But I really like Five Guys and this location is superb!  They have really yummy fries and they give you so many! Like your bag overflows with the greasy buggers. Say what? Yeah they are really greasy. But good! The burgers are really quite the bang for your buck too! Not the best burgers in the world but it is fast food not gourmet burgers. Be considerate for what you are eating and enjoy it for what it is.  The pop machines are radical. You can pretty much have flavoured any beverage you like.  The staff here is really friendly and that is a plus anywhere you go!
3,"Hula's seems pretty hyped. I had drinks here that were OK. I had food here that was OK. I'll try it again and get an entree, but I'll not likely go out of my way to make it here."
4,"I'm working downtown now (new themed list to come soon!) so I'm exploring the area from a different angle. I'm no stranger to downtown/midtown's happy hour and dinner spots, but I've never had to go out and search for breakfast or lunch during the day.  I checked out Focaccia one morning when I hadn't had breakfast yet at the recommendation of my husband, Myles M, who works right around the corner. He said I should order the breakfast burrito, so I did, because he's pushy and I always do what I'm told. Ok, neither of things are true, but in this case, he had conviction and I obediently complied.  The breakfast burrito was worth every penny. Being a somewhat recent convert to pescetarianism, I got it with egg whites (cool that they had that option), spinach, green salsa and potatoes. The woman behind the counter made it up right there on the grill and it was warm and delicious. The potatoes were skin-on which gave them a great texture and flavor. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the green salsa had a great kick.  The hot coffee from the carafe I got to accompany it was airplane-quality, but next time, I'll just grab something from Cartel on the way back to my office. God knows the burrito alone will be enough to keep me coming back to Focaccia."
4,"Been a few times at various times for various reasons. Food - 4/5 Love the bruschetta, sandwiches are good really no complaints, good alcohol selection.  Service - 4/5 I always receive good service.  Valet is always youthful. Atmosphere - 3/5 Casual, great place for meeting friends. can be a little too busy for my liking. Price - 3/5 Average I can't really complain. Overall - I don't go out of my way to go here, but I certainly recommend it."
2,"I have been a long time customer at this car wash with this location. I have been going there since it Changed from Weiss Guys to Diamond Car wash and now its known as Francis and Sons. It seems the service has declined for each change of ownership.   Today was the tip of the iceberg and I will not be going there again. The past 2 visits have proven to me that their customer service has rapidly declined.   I understand that every business needs to ""Upsell"", but it becomes an annoyance when they keep bugging me 5,6,7,8 times after I have said no. Don't even get me started on their glass repair salesmen.... I always get the Premium auto wash, a few weeks ago I went and when I got home I noticed they had not cleaned my dash or center console (which is included in premium). I also noticed they had not wiped down my tires after applying Armor All and it all splattered up to the sides of my vehicle after driving away, I wrote these off as a simple mistake and that it probably would not happen again.   Today's experience was worse. I took my truck in for a wash and I told the guy I did not have time for a hand wax (upsell) I was then pressured into buying it in advance so I could come back another day and get it waxed. No was not an answer to this guy, I had to actually walk away to leave this Pressured UPSELL.   Again, I purchased the premium wash. They called for the vehicle and I noticed that there were little black spots (mud?) all over the side of the truck. I told the guy about this and he said ""its ready."" I explained that it wasnt and started using my finger to poke at what was probably 20-30 little black spots all over the side, he gave me a disgusted look and told me he had to go get a clean rag. I asked for a manager.   The manager came and had the guy wipe the spots off, but did not seem to care at all and walked away before the guy wiped down half of the spots. I had already given a tip to the first guy and this guy stood there expecting a tip, I am generous with tips, but will not tip more because I had to ask them to fix their mistake.   Upon entry of my vehicle I noticed there was still some dirt on the floor and my center console armrest was not cleaned. I only took the truck in due to my dog leaving paw prints on the center armrest and hair all over the place...   I got an oil change at Danny's Car Wash at Tempe Marketplace a few weeks ago, and was so Impressed by their service and car wash service that I will make the 20 minute trip to go up there for my car wash from now on."
4,"I enjoy their Rama Chicken. Their peanut sauce is great. However, their service is slow. It is difficult to eat lunch their because it takes so long. If they improved their service my rating  would be 5 stars."
4,"Who woulda thunkkkk Scottsdale, AZ would have such amazing soul food??! They surprised the hell outta me! Coming from someone who regulars Roscoes chicken &waffles... believe me when I say LOLO's is BOMB!!!  I got the 3chicken combo... w greens, mac&cheese &cornbread.   Cornbread.. hands down Roscoes! Greens... Roscoes Mac&cheese... LOLOs for suuuree! Chicken... tied.. they're both really good! the staff is super friendly!! can't wait to go back when i visit AZ. (="
1,"I had received an email from a student retention telling me that I still owe money for the time that I had taken classes (two weeks) although these fools canceled my financial aid. I will sue this school if they even attempt to collect money from me and I have withdrawn from the classes on the right time, but this rep. told me that the withdrawal period was Jan. 11."
3,Really good prices but I would stray from the wings. It is very greasy so beware!
1,Very bad food!
5,"This place has a top notch tuna tataki app! Great rolls out quick regardless of how busy they are. Excellent service all the way around and very reasonable on price. Green tea ice cream for after dinner treat, I think so!!!! I forgot to mention I was in and out during lunch time spending 20 dollars."
5,"I have been going here for years. I love the ""Hong Kong"" style pan fried crispy noodles!"
3,"I was so looking forward to going to this restaurant.  It has a nice view of a man-made pond, but the food is barely average.  If the ambience wasn't so nice, it would get only 2 stars."
5,"Great selection, TONS of flavor, always hot and fresh, nice staff, great prices. In my top 3 quick restaurants."
5,"Whenever my brother is in town he always stays here so when the hubby & I were looking for a place to get away for a night we stayed here. We are the not the party crowd which is why we chose to stay here on a Tuesday after a holiday weekend. Here is my take on Hotel Valley Ho: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. Good: 1) Gigantic, comfy bed. I slept like a queen. 2) Private balcony with large chaise lounge and sitting area. 3) Outstanding bathroom. The tub is separate from the shower which is and the toliet has a room all to itself. 4) Cool decor both interior and exterior.  Bad: 1) Bed pillows were too squishy.  2) Toliet paper/bath tissue was surprisingly rough. I would expect a hotel of this caliber to have a softer tissue. 3) The mini bar and console are fully stocked with an assortment of spirits, but no coffee or tea. Not everyone that stays here drinks his/herself into a stupor. Ugly: 1) Parking is $15 per day, but you have the option to self park which doesn't cost a thing so I guess that's not really ""ugly"". Overall, we had a lovely stay at Hotel Valley Ho and look forward to our next visit."
5,"This is the location I frequent most (it helps it is less than a mile from my home).  I have been to a U.S. Egg (this and other locations) more than a dozen times (or two) since moving to AZ in 2010. I love breakfast food and the ""specialty"" won me over instantly; PROTEIN PANCAKES! As the timeless Tina Turner once said, ""Simply the Best!"". That describes these pancakes perfectly.  Before I go on and on about the pancakes (because I have been known to do so) some background information about atmosphere, staff etc.  This location is in a nondescript one story building in front of the offices at Mill Towne Center (or is it Mill Town Centre?). Nothing fancy, but I don't need a ""Jacket Required"" sort of feel to a place to enjoy my breakfast.  The staff is fantastic; hosts/hostesses, waitresses, busboys. I have never had anyone employed here be anything but 100% professional and attentive. To speak to something others have mentioned about getting the check early (while they are still eating); as long as you continue to be my waitress (i.e. refills, requests for jelly, etc.) I don't care if you bring the bill with the food. If I decide I want something else, I doubt any of the folks here would have a problem reprinting a corrected bill. Now on to the food!!  The protein pancakes are filled with blueberries, granola, cinnamon and silvered almonds. The ingredients aren't something exotic, but they are perfectly balanced in the mix (not too much or too little of any of them). The thing about any food item you like at a restaurant, it becomes a favorite because they are able to duplicate it time after time. I have had this item many times (more than any other item), and they are always spot on (knock on wood) :).  All the other dishes I have had (always breakfast, haven't tried lunch yet) were some combination of eggs and protein, and the eggs are always perfectly cooked to my specification (over medium), and the meat always juicy.  I promise to write another review as soon as I don't get the protein pancakes (which will be when they decide to remove them from the menu - NEVER). :) Oh, or if I actually go in later than normal and feel like lunch over breakfast (not good odds :O)."
1,"I wish they had a ""0"" star option too! The service and food was awful. Just a bunch of kids running the place.  The place closes at 10pm but when we went in there at 8pm all the workers were too busy cleaning to go home early to help us.  The food was burnt  on one side and raw on the other. The manager was too busy flirting with the other help. We couldn't get drinks because all the glasses where dirty, we were told by our waitress. We asked for the manager before we left at 8:45 and was told he already went home for the evening. What kind of manager leaves a bunch of teenager to run the place?  NEVER GOING BACK!!!!"
5,"Awesome. So much better than parking on site. Safe and good prices keep me coming back. Flying during a busy time, go to their website to make a reservation...that's right a reservation! Also print out a coupon for a couple bux off per day."
5,"Great place, enjoyed the amenities. Pool was great and view on the property was very picturesque. Food in the property restaurants were very good. Definitely would stay there again if ever in Scottsdale again."
5,"I got to stay here for work and had the best time! They have so many pools. I would spend my afternoons in the smaller pools and have the pool all to myself. It was great! They let me send free postcards which was fun, too. My room was beautiful. It was large and had great amenities.  Food was disgusting though. I didn't have access to a car so I was pretty limited to eating hotel food for a week. Everything I ordered was gross and I tried it ALL! I thought customer service was fine--not great, just adequate."
4,"Velvet wallpaper adorn the dimly lit  walls here, and make you feel like Dean Martin might sit at the table next to you. Old school, in the classic sense. I used to work across the street from here, and would stop in from time to time for a great happy hour, occasional employee lunch for my staff or a special occasion dinner from time to time. Being from New England, it says a lot when I admit that they have the best Oysters Rockefeller I have ever had. Ever. The steaks are just wonderful, and the martinis perfectly poured. But you know what secret thing I ADORE about this place (besides the back entrance through the kitchen)? The bread. Warm white rolls smothered in a garlicky-leek chutney of some sort. For all those times your Mom told you not to fill up on bread, just disregard. She never had this bread. While I think you should always splurge here for a fantastic dinner, the real bargains are lunch and Happy Hour."
5,"NO BETTER BREAKFAST IN AZ. From scrambled eggs to their blueberry pancakes. Top end. Yes, you pay for it. But it's special, like Valentines Day. Just pay out and enjoy the treat. Lunch is also nice, especially if you get a seat outside so you can people watch. Great wraps and sandwiches. Haven't tried anything later here yet. But I saw their happy hour specials and it is on my TO DO list."
5,Great happy hour specials.  All the appetizers are delicious!  Service is first rate and it's nice to sit outside on the patio.  Great people watching without being too obnoxious!  LOL
1,"This was the most HORRIBLE floor cleaning I have ever seen!!!!! We took before and after pictures and cannot tell the difference at all! The guy was not friendly and just wanted our money even though he did not do his job! I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone. We paid $1000 and got $20 worth of service. I mopped the floor the day after the cleaning guy was here and got a lot of the ""staining as he would say"" off easily. I have included a picture that we wrote in the floor with a paper towel after the cleaning....can you read the saying? That is exctaly how we felt after the service. REALLY?!?!?"
4,I never tire of a deliciously hot bowl of Pho from this place. This service is efficient and the food tastes so very fresh. The veggie pho is my favorite along with the soft appetizer spring rolls. My son usually gets the beef pho or one of the fried rice dishes and we have never been disappointed. Good lunch crowd every single day of the week. Yummy.
4,"Walking into this place is just plain confusing.  You could tell it used to be something different, but I've got no idea what.  I guess it doesn't matter.  It just sort of looks cheap.  But that's ok. The food was right on, and I'll be back for more.  Bento Box A?  Yes please.  Small salad with a great ginger-type dressing, some sort of spicy beef, teriyaki chicken, rice, egg roll, some edamame, a few carrots... am I missing anything?   The service was great, the food even better, and it only set me back about 5 minutes and 8 bucks.  It seems like a sure bet, and close enough to work for a good take out that it will rise toward the top of my list."
4,"As far as Subway's go, this one is better than most than I have been to. I frequent this Subway quite often as it is the closest Subway to my office. The candor from the ""sandwich artists"" is always refreshing. You can tell most of them actually enjoy their jobs. Once I found a piece of plastic in my sandwich. You know when you open a bag of turkey and the edges of the bag are all tough to break open? A sliver of that ended up in my sandwich. The manager was quick to act and ended up making it a non-issue for me. I appreciated how he took charge and took care of it. Just another reason why I go back."
4,"We went to Ocean Prime the other night and it was delicious.  I don't know if it was worth the money but it was definitely good.  The setting is as attractive as any restaurant I can remember, with classical contemporary decor and a very cool display of alcohol bottles in the bar. I was in a party of seven and the prevalent dish was the bone-in filet.  We had heard it was better than the steakhouses in Chicago.  Well I'm from Chicago, and trust me, you get a better (and bigger) bone-in filet at Joe's.  But it was still a delicious steak.  The sides were terrific and the salads were good too.  But those prices!  Wow, value is not this restaurant's strong suit. About the only other thing I'll add is the service was below average, a concern considering what the prices were like.  Our server tried hard but he was too slow and didn't get our order right."
3,"Outside the treats, you get an adorable and sleek interior which is very comfortable and feels great to be in, and fun people watching to boot. Its a little expensive for the drinks - I figure that comes with the territory."
5,"Great ambiance (though a tad noisy), food, service and views. For our meals, we got the following: [Amuse bouche] I forgot what it was exactly, but it consisted of tumeric wild rice and a piece of shrimp. Tasty and a nice introduction, although the rice was annoying to eat with our forks. [Appetizer] Bread with 3 dips - The pepper pesto was hands down the winner, and the other two aren't worth mentioning. Butter lettuce salad - Decent, but a little too sweet for me. Lobster bisque - Very rich and creamy with a kick of smoky flavor. [Entree] Halibut - Best dish in recent memory! Get this. Just do it. Roasted cauliflower risotto - Came with very tender pieces of beef. The risotto was cooked well, but it was unfortunately too salty for me to properly enjoy. [Dessert] Espresso cup - The ice cream was delicious. The rest of it was okay. After dinner, we took a trip outside to take in the view. We also explored the surroundings around the entrance, but it only led to an empty lot with the unflattering presence of a dumpster. Oh well! The service was great, from the host calling to confirm the rsvp an hour after it was booked on opentable, to the sommelier suggesting a great bottle of wine, to the server making sure there was a candle in the dessert. Two thumbs up! Totally coming back once it cools down to be able to dine/drink outside. Woohoo!"
4,"I had no idea they were open for lunch! Perfect since the boy and I were down town during lunch the other day.  We stopped in around 2:30 inthe afternoon. No Wait! I couldn't even believe it. I hadn't eaten there since I was a little girl, but it was just as good as I remember. We got a couple beers and split the Margarita Pizza. It was sooo yummy! Perfectly crispy on the edges and lots of flavor. The service was a tini bit slow, but no big deal, we loved it.  If you want great pizza and dont want to wait the normal 3 hours during dinner, you should hit up Pizzaria Bianco while the sun is still up, less wait time if at all.  Enjoy!!"
4,"Had to bring my wife's necklace here to be repaired. Service was great, the pretty looking girls were very helpful. In all, we had a very good experience. Looks like we will be coming back soon. Wife had her eyes on something?"
5,"Being from San Antonio I missed Rudy's so much! This Arizona location is similar, but different. The BBQ is definitely a winner, but their now commercialized packaged BBQ sauce is horrible! Bring back the other stuff in the Styrofoam containers! I will still keep coming for the brisket when I'm in the area!!!!!"
5,"Tried them out for Restaurant Week.  The food and service was excellent.  I will certainly be back and loved the atmosphere. We sat at a booth and very comfortably sat 3 adults.  The wait staff was non stop on refilling drinks, bringing more bread, making sure the food was cooked to order."
4,"One thing you will notice about Zia's, they really work to great everyone who comes into the store, and that is, I think, indicative of the overall spirit of service you can expect to find in this store filled with a surprising cast of beatnik, bearded, tattooed, and pierced staff that you will find at this emporium of music and cinema. Some items are a bit pricey but wonderfully fun to drift through the isles and see what you can find in the used section of the store. I'm more of a cinema person myself and just picked up a blue-ray and a DVD video last night (sort of a payday tradition for me). Even better, when I've compiled too many movies in my personal collection, I can take them down to recycle them into the used section and have more credit to spend on other new items in the store. Though I'm not remotely beatnik in appearance (firmly a member of the establishment in appearance) I've always been warmly greeted and welcomed by the delightful staff at Zia's and consider it to be an important and unique part of the downtown Mill experience. One thing I would like to see them do, and maybe I've overlooked it, is carry some actual vinyl albums, but there is only so much space, but that seems like it would fit with the overall ethos of this fine establishment."
4,I just love this place and  I always leave feeling refreshed and relaxed.  Highly recommend any of their spa treatments.
4,"Great sandwiches! the bread was superb. I had a BLTDA (Bacon, lett, Tomato, date, apple) w/chicken. Yummm. such a cute spot."
1,"I called The Town Dump to ask if I could come in this week and interview them for an English paper about a small local business, and the owner was just incredibly rude. She didn't even let me finish telling her it would take five minutes of her time, preferring to interject and tell me to go somewhere else. When I explained that I've heard wonderful things about their business from friends, and that that sparked my interest, she said, ""Well, go somewhere else."" I've never even been inside, and I sure as hell won't go now. Maybe it's just me, but I don't like shopkeepers who snarl at their customers."
5,"LOVE Chino Bandido.  The snickerdoodle cookie they give you with your meal is heaven.  Well, all of the food might actually be heaven, but usually by the time I get to the snickerdoodle I could die happy on the spot."
5,"This is a great place in an extremity of the Valley. They serve both Korean and Japanese food. They are quick and attentive. Having lived in South Korea for two years, I can honestly admit that this is some of the most authentic Korean cuisine I've had in Phoenix. I typically ate bibimbap once a week minimum over there and I can't really tell the difference between Takamatsu's version and the stuff I had on the other side of the Pacific. I noticed they offer a list of other, more obscure foods I learned to love over there, including naengmyeon (cold, spicy noodles), japchae (stir-fried glass noodles), and several other dishes. They also follow tradition and bring you several side dishes. Love it or hate it, kimchi accompanies every meal, as do spicy bean sprouts, a tangy spinach dish and a few other random sides. It's a little bit more expensive than average restaurant prices in the Valley, but definitely worth it when you consider the sides that come with it, and a complimentary spiced tea for ""dessert."""
4,"I met up with a girlfriend at borders. This Border's is across from the Scottsdale fashion square. The store is inviting, clean, bright, and new. They have a variety of books, and good sales. Upstairs is the Seattle's best coffee cafe. I had a coupon for a free medium drink when you buy a bag of coffee beans. I was surprised how good my cafe mocha was, better than Starbucks. note: If you have little kids, they do have story time on Mondays at 10:00 AM. Every Friday is Bean Friday in Seattle's Best Coffee cafe. Buy a bag of beans and receive a FREE medium beverage."
1,"As I promised myself, I'd go back again to try it again. Yyyeeaahhhh...sooooo....the food is still not good. I got the mongolian beef and it's like ""wha? really? is this IRL?""  I'm a chinese food kind of a fan, this restaurant, I'm not a fan of."
3,Ok..seriously just ok. Green salsa was horribly sweet and gel like. It had no taste of tomatillo in it. The tacos were stuffed to the gills but average. The chimis tasted reheated in the microwave and oddly like sopapillas. Over all ok food but a bit pricy for ok food.
5,"Loved it. Food was great, service was great. Not easy to find, but worth the search!!!"
4,"Am ashamed to say I have filled up my punch card, twice.  Usually get the Hook and Ladder.  But the main reason I keep going back...the magical Coke machine of Awesomeness."
4,"Best burger I've ever had, and a great view from the patio.  Enjoyed a wonderful date with my husband there."
4,"Upscale restaurant on-site at the Wigwam. The hotel's location means that there are few full-service restaurants close by - so we chose to eat here. We were very glad we did! Service is great - fast, friendly, and prompt. Food was terrific (ribeye for me). Would definitely eat here again."
4,For our first time we had a great time! Our server was very knowledgable about the menu especially the drink menu. Culinary Dropout has to have some off the most creative drinks I've seen in a while. Everyone mentioned the pretzels on Yelp and they were right! The cheese sauce was velvety and delicious and the pretzel bites had the perfect texture. My girlfriend and I both couldn't finish our sandwiches because they are pretty big. I will definitely be going back to try the charcuterie menu.
4,"This place is a good go to when you're looking for a mexican infused panda express.  Haha.  Yum!  I got the combo meal with the Jade Red chicken made into a quesadilla and the diablo chicken.  Really good!  I also got jerk fried rice.  The beans were also very good.  Yummy in my tummy.  I really enjoyed Chino Bandido's, but don't think I could go more than once during a trip to Phoenix (I'd get very large from eating like this!).  :D  Oh yeah, if you want something more than a snack, don't just get a quesadilla by itself.  My poor brother thought the quesadilla would be huge and good enough for his dinner (thinking taqueria size), but it was pretty sad and small.  Luckily, my combo wasn't that small and I had extra food to share."
4,"A short review is in order here because after all we are talking about freakin donuts.  However, in AZ there are no good donut shops for the most part.  We had three donuts - glazed, chocolate long john, and a chocolate old fashioned/sour cream.  The last was a bit stale.  The first two were great.  We will go back.  Nice little place and it's open 24 hours."
2,"Wed-Sat, sit at the bar and ask for bartender JOY. She's a GAS! Great spot for a late-afternoon glass of wine with an appetizer. Mostly poor execution from kitchen, excellent service. --hummus appetizer with sample of olives is great choice --crispy plantains with pepper are tasty and fun, crab dipping sauce, not enough crab --tuna salad with arugula, uninteresting --side salad for ciabatta ""sandwich"" typical Dole bag mix (first visit) was WILTED and nasty. Shame! --chicken salad with dried tomatoes and goat cheese; way too much cheese Now, to Joy. She's a keeper. First visit, we struggled with the proper preparation of a Sapphire martini, but it was primarily the fault of our server's communication skills. Working with machine-made ice (you know, the stuff with all the flecks and shards that water down a proper martini), she primed the ice with a squeeze of lemon, drained, then prepped the glass with vermouth, in and out, then pour the STIRRED Sapphire in, drop twist! Congrats, my lady. If you can get past the chick-chosen wallpaper (wrong) and perfect-sphere fake tabletop plants from restoration, the different-height tables mix up the room just right and make it feels shabby chic without the white. Say hi to Joy. =)"
4,"This place is so busy - it is most definitely not a hidden gem, although it sits back in the neighborhood.  The food and coffee are good - but most of all, I like that I can walk my dog here to get coffee and the newspaper on the weekend.  I wish that there were more places that allowed pets outside.  The parking can be a pain and the ordering and picking up of food can be chaotic.  But, once you get settled - this is a good place to visit."
2,"A huge disappointment.  I had been looking forward to getting to Iruna and experiencing what I thought would be an experience to all the good food, service and times once had at Sol Y Sombra.  Joke was on me and my friends!   I would give the service 1 star, but because a few of the dishes were very tasteful, I am giving two stars.  The waiter was nice, but did not belong in the service industry.  He called us ""dudes"" (I wasn't on the beach and he wasn't wearing swim trunks, no need for ""dude""), he kneeled on the table bench directly behind us, basically breathing down my neck when he talked (gross), never asked us how the food was, even when we didn't touch more than 2 pieces of the calamari (that was saturated in oil and desperately needed a few squeezes of lemon).  He took dishes away that we were not finished with.   The food was good - some dishes were great and some were not good at all.  The romesco sauce served with the croquettas was delicious! I could have eaten just a side of the sauce alone.  It has just enough spice and the flavors were spot on.  The trout was another delicious dish.  The fish was cooked to perfection and everything on the plate hit the palette in all the right places.   The calamari was awful.  It was over fried, and instead of serving with a lemon wedge, was served with a citrus aioli - the concept would have been great if worked with the dish. Even after taking the lemon from my water and squeezing on the dish, it was not appetizing. If you check them out online and want to go try them for happy hour - sit at the bar (maybe on the patio, I didn't ask) but we were seated in the actual dining area and then told the HH menu was only available at the bar.  No biggie, but not the best way to attract repeat customers.   The space itself is very nicely decorated, it was comfortable and had a lot of details that worked well with the rest of the decor.   Overall, I think they did a great job with the space, if they tweaked just some small things with some of the food items, they could make them much better and as for service - contrary to popular belief, just because you're in Scottsdale, doesn't mean your staff should be wearing Ed Hardy t shirts and calling customers ""dude""."
5,"Went here tonight with the padres and husband.  This place is the whole Joes BBQ/Joes Farm Grill owners.  We saw that it was the highest rated here on Yelp for restaurants in Gilbert.  Paper menus are available near the counter where you order your meal.  We started with the Hummus + olives appetizer.  Mom and I shared the Apricot Chicken with mashed sweet potatoes, Dad had some steak sandwich with horseradish that was very tasty, husband had the Salmon BLT with avacado.  I tasted everything and ALL the food was delicious!!  There were also very interesting and unique beer and wine offerings.  There is an espresso bar that sells various coffees, as well as some sweet stuff.  There is still a little market in the back selling local olive oil from Queen Creek Olive Oil Mill, as well as pasta, pure vanilla extract and other items. I highly recommend a trip to Liberty Market for a fresh, home-cooked meal."
4,"It is romantic here even if you are with just friends. The waitress kneels at the couch to speak with you, pour your wine, bring your check...I love that...its so 5 star and respectful. Our waitress was so friendly and I was on cloud 9 because the whole ambience made my evening so nice. I love the darkness of it, its all so exotic and relaxing there especially with all the coves and different areas to be seated. Apparently you have to put your name down if you want a table for certain as it seems to be packed anytime I have been there. We needed one more bar stool-we had no reservation and the waiter actually went ""out to the storage"" to get us one. Impressive!"
5,"The best Chinese food I have had since leavong Chinatown in California.  The crab puffs had crab, not Krab and were much more crab than puff.  The food was cooked perfectly and delicious.  I strongly recommend the Mu Shu Pork!!"
4,"A clean shopping center with many classy options for food, drink and retail therapy."
4,"Okay, since my latest review, I was contacted by the manager who expressed concern on my bad experience. Fran wanted to make sure they had the opportunity to make it right. I was impressed! I do want to say that even if the food sometimes needs a little sumptin sumptin, the customer service is Great and always has been! I give them superb credit for that & the ambiance is nice too. We went back for another try & we were satisfied. I definitely think you should stick with the thin or traditional crust, it was better. Also a note to update a previous review - they no longer have the Portobello Steak Sticks, not sure why, maybe a cost thing, but they were delicious and I will miss them! Another cool note that should be said because it can't be said about most places with an outdoor patio - they do not allow smoking in the patio dining area, which is such a refreshing change. It's nice to be able to enjoy the great Arizona weather this time of year. Thanks for that! Final words... BoomBozz is on the top of our list again"
3,"Cherry on Top is a rare example of design by market analysis committee, who couldn't decide on a unique concept so they decided to ""borrow"" from all of their competitors' styles, turning out at least as well as if not better than its individual inspirations. The result provides convenient answers to the following frozen yogurt questions: - Can't decide between tart and traditional? Why not both? - Can't decide between standard or high-end sweet? Mix vanilla, taro, green tea, cheesecake (but only at your own risk.) - Feeling constrained by four fit all sizes? $0.39/oz., cup weight subtracted. - Wavering on the topping healthiness spectrum? Fruit to sugar cereal to nuts to crushed big brand candy available. The quality is close enough to most of the relevant rivals (as long as one is not requiring the desert honey Sweet Republic tart variant) but, correctly and perhaps intentionally, the value proposition is that most patrons won't care about the slight dip, trading off for the flexibility of purchasing (only) as much yogurt and toppings as desired while satisfying Hershey's-acclimated children with a Frankenstein of saccharine flavors and junk toppings as well guests from the city pining for the nearest Pinkberry with original tart plus kiwi, strawberries, blackberries and pineapple."
3,"10/12 Friendly and quick, although I had to point out a few spots where extra attention was needed (tar on one side was initially observed as paint scratch, until I told them to check it again).  I also found a few spots that could've used another one or two swipes of the towel, and the sunglass case was never touched and thus dirty.   Be sure to visit during the early part of the week, and not on the weekend to grab the best deals- I paid $100 for both interior and exterior detailing.  Am so happy with the overall results- the spots between the bottom of my car seats and the floor are completely clean of caked-on food debris (I am living in the middle of the desert, after all) from a few mishaps throughout the years!"
4,"I love this place for lunch or a casual happy hour when I am in town. The Chips are amazing. They are not your typical tortilla chips. Every basket has a sweet, spicy and regular flavor. The food will not WOW you but then again this is a laid back tex mex restuarant with good margarita's decent food but a really good atmosphere!"
5,If I were to ever get hooked on crack... I would want my crack to be these amazing donuts! They are delicious and addicting.
5,Perfect place for a hot summer day.  Amazing paletas!  Friendly staff and fresh ingredients.  Welcoming environment in downtown Chandler.
5,"Saw this place in the Yelp email.  Needed to take my son to Toys R Us to use a gift card and it occurred to me that Habit Burger was right there, so I suggested we have lunch there rather than the usual McD's.  I temped him with the offer of a chocolate shake. I was amazed with the cleanliness and brightness of this place.  There was a line when we got there, but it moved quickly.  The tables were packed but we managed to snag a 2-top pretty soon after getting in line.  My son had the kids grilled cheese meal (something you don't find at your standard fast food place) and I had a charburger.  We shared his fries and the shake. OMG - the burger was heavenly!  The roll gets a little grill to it so it has a little crunch on the inside.  It was not greasy at all, just tasty and soooo good!  The fries were equally ungreasy and good - crunchy too.  The chocolate shake - my son only had about 3 sips which left me to drink the rest of it (dang it) - was absolutely delish.  And the prices were outstanding! Its a good thing there isn't a Habit Burger closer to my house.  I'd eat there all the time!  Five Guys?  Forget em!!!"
4,"I went here with my mom while my dad had a dinner meeting. The atmosphere is hip but it's also got a mature setting. It is a really great place for young adults and even older ones. The price was good, the food was amazing! The portions were also big and MOST the staff was friendly. I overheard two rude staff members making fun of the customers. However they might not even work there anymore. Great place!"
5,"Owner Daniel M. is one of my most favorite restaurateurs in Phoenix. His stamina and passion for the business of serving fine cuisine is a rare find. Daniel is from South America but you wouldn't know it; his knowledge of the secret kitchens of Tuscany, Umbria and Amalfi is uncanny. I know this because I traveled with him and his chef one year on their odyssey through Italy. Daniel takes special pride in personally choosing a very select few bottles of wine to fit any budget. OK, it's not Etienne's Different Point of View's list of 4000, but know that any choice you make is going to be a good one. If you're not sure, just ask for Daniel and tell him what you have in mind -- likely he has (with a wink) a special bottle in the back. When we traveled through the Italian countryside I was constantly astonished by the warm greetings and special invitations we had from local proprietors who shared with us exquisite homemade wines and dishes made with pride from the finest vegetables and livestock. We frequently stayed long past closing with the owners and into the night sampling rare port and grappa. At one restaurant in Orvieto the owner took us deep into the dank recesses of the wine cellar for a special sampling  of cheese and wine. Talk about knowing people? One afternoon while drinking our 5th bottle of wine, who walks by but Jan D'Atri! Wow. (That's another review.) And speaking of reviewers, I also ran into Phoenix Magazine's Nikki Buchanan (also extremely nice). When Daniel first opened in this location with that little stone oven in the corner, it was a pizzeria and guests could belly up to long tables in a casual environment that was made easy by his banter with the heavy Italian accented waitress (name?) who made a comeback some years later. For quite some time the restaurant was Il Forno; that is until corporate giant Il Fornaio entered the fray and sued him to change the name. After much rigmarole he changed to aqua e sale -- and notice Il Fornaio has since closed its doors? LOL. Again after much hoopla, he made it Daniel's. The current wood-paneled decor makes me think of a city club in San Fran or London. Very posh, yet understated. Selections of sculpture and art from his travels dot the restaurant's three small dining rooms. The menu is a very difficult one. I say that because it has all of your favorites and it is difficult to make your final selection. Great for steak, ravioli, the best carpaccio in the city, best buffala mozzarella, mmm.... I could go on and on. So does the menu, page after page. Some might call the preparations simplistic. This is the Tuscan way. Simple ingredients and simple preparation. Let the ingredients make their own magic. Grilled rack of lamb is not drowned in some Smucker's lime jelly, but gently brushed with rosemary and garlic, tickled with salt and pepper and finished with a squeeze spray of lemon. Unfortunately the artful one-of-a-kind plates and bowls handmade in Vietri chipped at the edges over the years and the health department made him throw them away -- UGH!! -- they were a beautiful motivation to make you lick your plate clean to see the painted pictures beneath your scrumptious dinner. Not that you needed an excuse to dab every last bit of sauce with the wonderful mini loaves of bread cooked right there in the hearth that started it all. Daniel himself is a wonderful host. He loves to give his guests a wonderful experience. There are many choices for Italian food in Phoenix. Most of it is just American Italian. Daniel's is a unique touch of the simple yet elegant. Enjoy. P.S. [post edit] OMG. How could I forget the Tiramisu? It's a generous portion, so you can share with your guest, but after your first bite you may not want to. Light and airy, yet fantastically flavorful, the quality of the coffee really makes this dish a reason to go back again and again. I'm not going to tell you the secret ingredient. You'll have to ask Daniel."
5,"I can't say enough wonderful things about this branch! The manager is fantastic, the other employees are happy, enthusiastic, and efficient.  Not to mention that everyone there has impeccable manners and they treat their customers as customers deserve to be treated! Go to this branch, you'll understand what I mean!"
4,"service was quite friendly and attentive, and the food was great. the fig/goat cheese/mint bruschetta doused lightly with fig sambuca was delicious, though its relative heaviness and sweetness reminded me more of dessert rather than appetizer.  roasted vegetable salad could be a meal by itself....very satisfying because it is not by any means a small serving and includes rich goat cheese and is served with wood fired bread on the side. nothing better than wood-fired pizza (and bread)! the pizza with artichoke, red peppers, and mushrooms was phenomenal. the rappini pizza i sampled was good, but missing something....more garlic and onion perhaps? the bread here was heavenly (as good or better than bianco), as was the pizza dough on both pizzas i tried. crispy on the outside without being fossilized or burnt, and chewy on the inside. lamp definitely has a handle on the bread/dough aspect. i didn't try dessert, but the ones listed on the menu read highly tasty and unique in print...."
3,"So I started getting a cold yesterday and wanted some more soup it was late already 8pm so hunny went off on the search for soup since it was Mothers Day n' all. He ended up at Manuels dont ask me why!! Our white neighbor loves eating here, he had heard from somewhere or someone that they had the best albondiga (meatball) soup?! Well it was wayyy tooo salty other than that it was ok kinda spicey not too hot though. I don't eat meat but the kid liked the meatballs it looked like they had rice in them anh herbs too who'd a thunk. Chips were a tad too greasy and the salsa wasn't too bad good heat, beans were good rice was alright. If it is necessary and in a pinch again I'd go again but prob not."
2,"i think reviews for this place are based on happy hour experiences. the food was SHOCKINGLY hot and fast out the kitchen. methinks there's some heavy microwave usage going on. the interior of the restaurant is and dark and fancy, but the food is mediocre and overpriced.  in fact, the roaring fork became both a barometer and a joke for the remainder of our visit in scottsdale. if you want an equally priced meal with amazing food, yelp something else closer to oldtown (might i suggest something from the Baratin/FnB empire)?"
2,"I feel the Days Inn Tempe is best described as ""a place where you can purchase the right to sleep for awhile.""  I booked my 10-night stay on Travelocity for a non-smoking room, yet when I entered the room I almost choked. It was disgusting. I've never had a smoking hotel room before and I will make sure I don't again. They said they couldn't move us to a different room. My local lady friend brought over a bottle of wine but forgot a corkscrew. No big deal, I thought to myself, as the front desk of a hotel will surely have a corkscrew. Nope. Coors Light it is. The towels felt like they were made of cow tongue, and they missed our wakeup call one morning making me late for a training class that had cost me about $500. I'm awarding one star in addition to the minimum one-star rating because I got to drink cheap beer by the pool in 90 degree weather for 10 days, and there are a few good places to eat and two dollar stores very nearby. The dollar store had a corkscrew."
5,"Honestly, I can't remember how I found out about Butter & Me, but I'm glad it happened. My fiancee (now wife!) and I are addicted to cupcakes and we decided to swap the traditional wedding cake for some delicious cupcakes. Kelly at Butter & Me did not disappoint. She was absolutely fantastic to work with and has *the best* cupcakes in the valley! Believe me, we taste-tested a number of other vendors and everyone else's cupcakes tasted like small, dry, cakes. The cupcakes from Butter & Me were exactly what we were looking for. They were perfectly moist, beautifully decorated, and there are a ton of delicious flavors to choose from!!! I cannot recommend Butter & Me highly enough! The Yelp review sums it up: ""Woohoo! As good as it gets!"""
5,"Just go eat here. Get the cheese curds, I think they may be developing CCA (cheese curd anonymous) soon, but until it becomes a diagnosable disease I will continue to indulge. Oh yah, the Pine Steak, is also fantastic and will probably also cause addictive like tendencies.  Oh, oh, oh...  the chicken and waffles are also a pleasant surprise in the other wise repetitive and ordinary dining scene that is so often found in Phoenix.  Just do yourself a favor and go check this place out. And try the home made ginger ale, tonic or lemonade by them selves... or mix it up with one of their top shelve spirits."
5,"Places like Made make me realize that there is hope for my life in Phoenix.  It is a cute converted house shop that carries a wide array of stuff that you won't find easily elsewhere.   There is lots of cute baby stuff that I would laugh at if I ever saw a baby wearing.  The jewelery is unique and cool- it made me feel like I had etsy right in front of me, live!  They have some good books around and some key David and Goliath pieces.   I heart places like Made, so therefore I heart Made."
3,"I went to Pei Wei last night for a casual girls' night dinner.  It was a perfect place for a group of girls to meet because of the following: -it's cheap -it's fast casual so each person pays their own bill and then sits down (no stress when the bill comes as is often the case with groups) -there is plenty to choose from on the menu -for those that are picky or dieting, they are great about special orders, sauce on the side, etc... That being said, Pei Wei is just average in my eyes; never my first choice of places to go, but I can always find something to eat... Last night I had the shrimp teriyaki bowl with brown rice.  The shrimp tasted like it came from the freezer (probably because it did), but the veggies, rice, and sauce were all pretty good.  I noticed they changed the menu a bit since my last visit, and a new 'special' is a Vietnamese Noodle Bowl - Pho type dish.  The chicken lettuce wraps and edamame are always safe bets and hopefully will remain on their menu forever. I'm sure I'll be back to Pei Wei because of the positive factors listed above - the concept is a good one, just don't compare it to a high end restaurant and enjoy it for what it is! PS - shout out to all the girls that came out last night - I had fun seeing all of you and can't wait for the next one!"
4,"Very good, fresh food, nice ambiance, reasonable prices & good service.  We're from out of town & found this place with the help of Yelp!  We'd definitely come back again! We had the Caprese Salad & the Sicily pizza.  Both very good."
4,"Who's got the munchies!!!!! Friday and Saturday nights till 3 am, Mrs. White's is servin' up some yummy munchies including Fried Zucchini around $3 and entrees for $13.  I had to have their fried chicken , pork chop and some gravy and rice at 12am! The fried chicken was cooked perfectly.  The skin is crispy and tasty.  The meat moist and tasty.  The portions are huge and you will not go home hungry.  The staff is friendly and helpful; always a pleasure to talk to them.  Skip Filibertos or Jack n' Box after the party..movie..concert..and go to Mrs. White's!"
5,"This place is our go to mexican place. I love the hot sauce and you can't go wrong with the Fundido sauce on the burritos. I personally enjoy the Chicken Fajito Chimi with Fundido sauce. It could possibly be the worst thing there to eat (and I love it). For the healthier days, I like the Pollo Salad. The chicken is always great here."
5,"This is my kind of restaurant. I love everything about Buca di Beppo! I am fascinated by how this place was decorated. All the walls and various trinkets make this a fun dining experience.  One thing to note is that it can be kind of expensive to eat here, although I am always finding coupons for this restaurant so that helps! Beyond that the food is awesome! I go with my fiance and we love the calamari and the garlic bread, which we always get as appetizers. We switch up the main course when we go, but each time has had great results. We had dessert here once too and that was also good! We usually end up with leftovers, because they give huge portions, which we love. I can't wait to come again!"
4,"The ""Shoe Dog"" experience was quite fun and entertaining!  It assists in finding the right shoe for your foot...and pretty accurate! Shop from hundreds of the best walking and running brands like ASICS, adidas, Brooks, New Balance, Saucony, Mizuno, Merrell, Nike, Puma, Pearl Izumi, Sperry, Timberland, Under Armour. You'll find fantastic natural running shoes from Vibram Five Fingers, Newton Running, and K-SWISS and trail shoes from Merrell, Salomon, and UK Gear. Grab the best gear from brands like Garmin, Baby Jogger, BOB, GU, Honey Stinger and FRS. You'll also find your favorite Triathlon Gear in the Road Runner Sports online Triathlon store. store. Choose from brands like 2XU, Shimano, Bont, Giro, Aquasphere and Xlab."
4,Great place to meet friends for a bite and some drinks.  Very social atmosphere and the food is really great.  Service did not disappoint and the prices are really fair.
5,"Perhaps you've heard of the Library of Congress.  Nice Library. Burton Barr Central Library has a bigger reading room. Wil Bruder was the Architect.  You either love his work, or you hate his work.  I love his work!  And, this library is as good as it gets. Arrive in the sixth floor reading room a little before Noon *on* the Summer Solstice.  Ask a librarian:  They'll tell you why. [ah, the mystery....]"
5,"One of a kind place to experience all senses!!  Food was great, service was great, AND they have a Moroccan Healer on staff.  Ask to taste the Moroccan Black Stone (not on normal menu).  I won't spoil how it makes you feel, but trust me when I say you will enjoy yourself! ;)"
4,"They say its bar food done right - I'd have to say I agree.  Got the burger and wings - both very solid.  Love the beer choices.  The prices are very reasonable for specialty beer and good bar food.  All in all, I am definitely going back regularly!"
5,This place is great.  All the food is fresh and always good.  They have a great happy hour daily with a very knowledgeable staff.  I highly recommend this place.
1,"Really, if I could, I would give this place zero stars, because it is a disgrace. If you need an emergency vet in the Scottsdale/Paradise Valley area, go to Sonora Veterinary Specialists on Cactus/40th St.(http://www.sonoraveterinaryspecialists.com/). It's also 24/7, but unlike VCA PVEAH, it is a truly valuable, legitimate facility, and it''s staffed by engaged, committed, deeply caring, and extremely knowledgeable and skilled personnel. At SVS, you and your pet are treated well and what you pay is fair and justified. VCA is the opposite of SVS in every single way. VCA is, in fact, the WORST of corporate animal service providers. The space is small, cheap, cramped, and the staff are indifferent at best and don't convey any genuine love of or concern about animals in pain or distress. All they want is your money. They do NOTHING for the $99.75 they charge for an ""emergency exam."" We essentially paid that amount just to be given an astronomical estimate, literally nothing more--our dog was the exact same bloody, traumatized mess we gave to them when they gave him back--after making us wait nearly an hour without ANY communication).  Furthermore, they tack on bogus surcharges ($5.25 for a ""biohazard waste fee"") that are irrelevant to the ""service"" provided, and their drug prices are absurd--$8 for a single Tramadol tablet, anyone? Conversely, our (and our dog's) experience at Sonora Veterinary Specialists was wonderful (even in the context of an emergency), and the cost was ultimately significantly less. VCA is a money-grubbing, depressing, sham."
5,"I really (REALLY) like The Lodge so I was gonna give it 4 stars. To be honest though, I really can't think of any good reason NOT to give it that 5th star. I've mostly been here for Happy Hour when visiting AZ, but I've also stopped in a few late nights, and have always had a good time. The Lodge has one of the best Happy Hours (deal wise) in Old Town. All apps (except the mac & cheese and fried pickles) are half off along w/$2 cheap drafts, $3 Lodge signature drafts (which is a tasty beer) & $3 wells (stuck to beer on this last trip, but if I recall in the past they actually use a heavy pour during happy hour). I've tried quite a few of the apps, and they're all good. The pretzels & cheese are particularly tasty. I always get pretzels & cheese no matter where I am w/the friend I came here w/for happy hour the last time I was here so I can say I've tried quite a few in my day & the Lodge's ranks right up there! I admit I'm a sucker for cheesy theme bars, so I kind of of dig the ski lodge theme here. the dining room area isn't huge, but is clean w/comfy seats. The bar area is pretty big & the patio is nice, weather permitting.  I've never had an issue w/the service here & both bartenders & bouncers are always nice."
5,"We decided to eat here on a whim. My husband got the burger brûlée and I got the beach house burger. Both were fantastic. The buns were perfect and we both agreed these were the best burgers we had had in a really long time. The sweet potato tater tots and French fries were also amazing. For $27 it fed our family of five. I'm definitely going back. Friendly service, casual atmosphere, and clean. Thumbs up all the way!"
4,"At the ripe old age of 3, it's time for my previous review to take a siesta. Over the course of that three years, Tempe Camera's only gotten better. The selection's improved (finally finding a happy medium between film and digital), the prices are even better than they were, and I dare say service on the retail side's kickass too. TCR is now my go-to photo supplier as a working pro. They've either got what I need or can quickly get it, they still know their stuff, and they support both local photographic education and the local photo industry. They're also the only dealer in the Valley that sells Think Thank Photo products, which are best damn professional camera bags ever. And if you're an amateur, they've got plenty of friendly, knowledgeable staff for you too. Don't be afraid to ask for someone else; like almost anywhere, they employ people of varying personalities. There are sales staff I don't click with at TCR, but I wouldn't classify anyone as distinctly rude. (If you want that, you'll have to try B&H or Adorama.) If you need lots of hand-holding, the ASU crush probably means you'll either want to shop at off hours or go to Photomark--TCR tries, but the crowd to counter ratio just isn't favorable at peak times. Repairs are still something they do very well at excellent prices. When I've had equipment serviced, it's been turned around quickly, relatively inexpensively, and works like brand new. Evaluation of your equipment is still free, as it should ideally be at every repair shop (but often isn't). The lab's added a bunch of cool new services, including damn fine plexi mounting, and is doing a considerably better job with film than their old reputation for free scratches with purchase would suggest. Hundreds of frames processed with nary a scratch to be found. Rentals I'm a little more ambivalent about.  They've thinned the herd out considerably (about half the rentals inventory has taken up residence in the used equipment case) and the selection of lighting equipment is basically unchanged, but they've got the latest Canon and Nikon bodies, and everything's well-maintained and in good shape. Rates are good for what they do have--the question's just if they have what you want."
2,These donuts don't taste good anymore. They have an aftertaste like they are using a different type of oil
2,"Not good. The patio is top notch for relaxing if the weather's good but I couldn't shake that chain feeling when inside. Table and chairs had a slightly sticky feeling to them (nice, eh?). Food was typical pre-cooked, oven heated dollop of too much grease and cheese. Not impressed. It's a shame cause the garden and even the nachos & salsa had me expecting big things."
3,"Narcisse is truly an interesting place.  Good food and pretty good service. The staff/servers look good and keep the ""image is everything"" so important here in Scottsdale working for this place even if the looks exceed the quality of the service. The late night crowd is of the ""look at me"" variety and makes it a good people watching establishment if you do not mind the huge egos that go with it.  The selections of food and drink are impressive. If you can reserve a table to dine and drink with friends do it as the place fills up and leads to a fun night out experience for the above 30 crowd."
5,"Yup. It's all true. Great food, super charming place, very intimate.  We sat outside on the patio under a heat lamp. Enjoyed the olives as a starter, as well as some fried raviolis (yes, please) and a caprese salad app.  Outstanding artisan pizza, with as good a crust as I've ever had, and homemade mozzarella. Wine was just ok, but very reasonable. Server was attentive, helpful and friendly. Owner came by a couple times to check in on us and was absolutely delightful.  Deduct a point for the proximity to the Handlebar J Saloon and the faux-cowboys arriving in limos with 10-gallon hats. Then add a point back for the near-fight we got to watch between a biker and the faux-cowboy who almost hit him with his Cadillac. We'll be back, and with more friends."
2,This place made me remember why I don't live in Scottsdale anymore.
5,"we went back here again this past weekend...actually we went there 3 more times this past weekend alone!  we couldn't resist the awesome service and great prices...and great live music.  this is definately going to be one of our ""regular joints.""  if you like the country...country girls....and good old rowdy shit..then stop by and check it out for yourself.  i bet you will like this place.   there is a large dance floor for some shit kickin' ...about 3 pool tables..big buck hunter and an outdoor area for smokin and boozin and dart throwin'.  i love this place.  this is what toby keith should have been singing about...seriously!"
3,"Ok, I usually write longer more intricate reviews about a restaurant but for this new establishment I will summerize. 1.  Great decor and ambience; would be better minus the flat screens 2.  Friendly service; but needs more training with food and knowledge of  3.  Timing of Kitchen; if a table has two or more persons, food should come out at the same time or around the same time.  Especially when they are not sharing. 4.  Food; if you specialize in spring rolls, please make sure they are rolled up proficiently.  It needs to be tight, not loose:) Flavors are good, but there could be a variation of sauce for the spring rolls.  4 rotating flavors for over 20 rolls is not a good ratio. 5.  Pricing is not bad for some items, but I do agree with other reviews that for most items, the pricing is a little high for the neighborhood biz and the quality of food offered. Overall, nice place to hang with friends for a drink and nibble before the actual dinner somewhere else. I will give it a few more months for an update.  This place has potential, but not well executed. When opening a restaurant, you should be ready and able to.  If you are not, you should wait til the staff is well trained.   I believe the owner or chef is inexperience.  Hopefully, it will improve... Get to work guys!!"
4,"On one of my Scottsdale excursions recently i got taken to Delux by a friend who said they make, ""the best burger she has ever had."" So obviously i had to put this to the test.We started with sweet potato fries which were served in a mini shopping cart which was entertaining. They were cooked to crisp perfection and lightly seasoned and still had the incredible sweet potato taste. I got to try the clasic delux burger itself and it was quite amazing, incredibly juicy and cooked just how i like it. We also got the lightly seasoned original fries as well which were just as good as the sweet potato ones. i also got to try the turkey burger which was also juicy and flavorful, along with the chicken panini which was incredibly tasty.  it was a great lunch every one i was with enjoyed themselves and I am glad my friend recommended it."
5,"Grassroots is right around the corner and we drive by it every week on our usual Friday-Dinner-Out.  I always assumed it was more of a pub than a restaurant.  My wife and I arrived around 5:00pm and were seated immediately.  The waiter was super attentive and knew the menu and preparation of everything I asked about.   We started with an AMAZING appetizer special of burrata* with ciabatta tips, their house spicy tomato jam and arugula with champagne vinaigrette.  It was described as a sort of an experimental combination of preparations from other dishes.  The burrata was silky smooth and spreads onto the ciabatta like softened cream cheese.  The play of flavors in this dish was excellent, we'd go back here just for this dish alone. My wife ordered the lobster bisque as her entree, which was smooth and creamy with a good lobster flavor.  I suspect we could have asked for bread on the side, but it didn't come with it by default. I ordered the short ribs with roasted asparagus and jalapeno cheddar grits.  The ribs were cooked just right, just a little pink and tender with a concentrated glaze of delicious sauce layered on top.  The sauce had a light smoky flavor with a fair amount of saltiness, and appeared to be a long simmered reduction with bold flavor. As others have mentioned, the jalapeno grits are very good, not spicy by any means but a little crunch from the jalapeno pieces, creamy and well prepared.  I strongly recommend the short ribs to anyone. We splurged with dessert of key lime pie and a banana split.  The split included three large scoops of (what appeared to be) homemade ice cream and topped with caramelized pecans.  The key lime was tart and delicious. The portion sizes were perfect and considering the careful preparation and unique flavors the price was appropriate.  It's a little more expensive that I would like to put Grassroots into our weekly rotation, but I look forward to visiting it again and sample more items off the menu when the budget allows. * I didn't know what burrata was: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrata"
4,Very good food. The tepanyaki was great! It does have a certain atmosphere though. Remember to dress appropriately. It can also be a bit pricey.
3,"Over-priced for the size of the facility and equipment available. The staff is friendly enough, and seeing as how its the closest 24 hour fitness place in this neighborhood, i suppose they get away with the price :)"
3,"This was my first restaurant in Phoenix. I was taken here for a lunch prior to an interview I had. I was pretty nervous about the whole situation so I don't remember too many details, but I would recommend this place if you're a sushi lover or on the go and need a quick lunch to eat at your desk. Service was great too."
3,Great place for dine-in and pick-up! Ambience: Contemporary/ Casual Food/Drink: American.  Good salads and desserts!
5,"Heard about this interesting steak house from Lindsay, my Yelping 'go to' and I am grateful. What a fun night, feeling ""Mad Men' ish as we walked through the kitchen when entering the restuarant.  Atmosphere was amazing and the food.... WOW. My fav had to be the amazing steak and bean chili/soup.... fantastic. Steaks were our of this world and the mushrooms... devine. When entering the restaurant we greeted by helpful eager staff ... with each one adding input into our experience.... especially Patti, our server. She was helpful, informative, fun and sealed the deal of a fantastic night. Thanks"
4,The pizza's very good! Unusual in that you have to order and pay first but they different combo pizzas are good. My favorite so far is the spicy chicken.
5,"My dentist recommended this place to me five years ago and every since then, I keep a keen ear to any of her recommendations as Shimagamo is the best sushi I've had anywhere.  I've had sushi in CA, NY, TX and HI.    The fish tastes fresh and the portions are generous.  One piece of advice is to eat at the sushi bar rather than one of the booths, assuming you are having sushi.  In my experience, sushi tastes better served as soon as each sushi piece prep is done rather than waiting for the entire sushi order to be completed.  This place has the best Unagi and an awesome Escolar (which I haven't found anywhere else.)  The Suprise Crazy Roll, served with a sweet wasabi sauce, is always on our Sushi order. The only con is that this place is pricey, but they do have a daily 5-7 happy hour that contains some great options.  However, the best stuff is usually not on the happy hour menu.  Also, this isn't a place to have Sake bombs.  It's a very low key atmosphere for those just looking for an excellent meal.  You'll likely notice early on how many folks are regulars.  I was told this was the spot where many Japanese baseball players come to have their Sushi. The restaurant is very non-descript.  It sits in a corner of a shopping mall and is easily overshadowed by it's neighbor C-Fu Gourmet."
4,"I have now played Longbow three times (twice in 2009, and once in 2010).  I do have to say it's a fine course for all tastes. I can't say it's a 5 star course, because it doesn't have quite the scenery and/or elevation changes that some that are nearer to the mountains have.  But it has enough interesting holes to make it a unique experience. It's not a gimmicky course by any means.  The course is more or less flat, with enough mounding on the fairways and around the greens to make it challenging.  One major advantage this course has is that there are not any houses on the course.  This means you don't have to worry about breaking anything if you like to slice the ball; the worst that can happen is that you lose your ball in the desert. I also really like the fast greens.  These greens are among the fastest and the truest I've played, and it's really a delight to putt on them. This is a great course for a cheap afternoon round during the summer.  For $40, you are probably better off going a few miles down the road to Las Sendas, but sometimes in the afternoon rates can be had for under $30."
4,"I stayed here for two nights the first week of April 2012.  Woot. Arizona weather really is the best.  Overall, it was a nice place to stay. Purdy too. I bought a deal on Hotwire and wasn't sure what hotel I was booking until I paid, and it turned out to be this resort.  Overall, very satisfied for the price I paid.  However, I do not think I would pay $200+ a night here.  At that point, I would say it's not worth it. The entrance is gorgeous and nicely updated. Trendy, modern, yet warm. Love the lit deer heads.  I want them.  It feels like a high class resort when you first go through the entrance.  Once you head to the rooms though, it does seem like an older resort.  However, our room was nicely decorated and very clean so no complaints in that area. If you are missing your pets from home, be sure to ask for a pet fish during your stay! I asked for one, well, I had to ask twice because they forgot the first time... But soon I had a goldfish in my room which I named Basil.  (Due to me becoming inebriated on one too many cucumber basil martini's... Don't judge) As for the room/parking, it's very easy to park extremely close to the entrance to the rooms which we liked.  It was easy to navigate in and out as the resort is fairly small.  The room itself, ours faced the parking area, which we didn't really care either way about.  It was close to the pool so that was good enough for us.  However, I will say the bed sucked.  When my husband turned, I too turned and bounced along with him.  They badly need to upgrade to better beds. While not uncomfortable per se, I don't enjoy feeling every teeny movement of my partners. They had nice toiletries- C.O Bigelow.  I enjoyed those little aspects. For an hour every evening they had free wine happy hour, which we did check out one of the evenings.  Hey, no one complains about Free Wine!!!  Nothing special, but it did the trick. Hotel Bar: Had some kick ass cocktails.  Plenty of strength and tasty concoctions. Biggest Bummer?  The pool area.  Don't get me wrong, it's pretty. First appearances are good.  There is plenty of shade from large palms and such and there's an area for kiddies with sand.  However, there is not enough chairs for the amount of guests.  And the guests that are there put towels on all the chairs even if they aren't around, which is not cool.  Suggestion to hotel:  Perhaps walk around every hour and remove towels if no one's been sitting there for awhile?  It's not fair for a select few to have a chair all day, while others are unable to lay by the pool at all.  And while there is plenty of shade, for me that was another downfall.  Almost too much shade.  It was hard to find areas to sun in compared to those covered by shade.  It made me majorly pissy.  Sun is why I came to AZ. Overall, a great place close to downtown Scottsdale and a walk away from the mall. Perfect for those who want to spend time near the action.  If you can get a good deal here, it's worth the stay. Plus, they have a free shuttle if you want to go somewhere a few  miles from of the place.  (so you can drink and have a driver)"
2,"I'll agree that this is a great meet up place in the city. Nice neighborhood, adequate parking in the structure behind, and a greta atmosphere with great service. The menu is interesting and I'd come back to try more but here's what our first visit was like. As a Starter we had the Spinach Quesadilla made with Lavosh and it was great. I mean really great and enough as a meal for two. For that alone I'd go back. My better half had the Falafel Pita and thought it was OK.  I had the Gyros Pita and got luncheon meat. I'm talking precisely sliced, straight from the fridge but thrown on the grill to warm-up luncheon meat. If you go online to see the menu, it's one of the items you can click for a nutrition chart. Here's what it reads for the ""meat"" Gyro Beef [Beef, Lamb, Water, Bread Crumbs (Bleached Wheat Flour, Water, Dextrose,Salt and Yeast may contain soy bean oil, Calcium Propionate), Soy Protein Concentrate, Less thean 2% Salt, Garlic and Onion Powder, Monosodium Glutamate, ]; So, the takeaway here is stay away from the Gyro.  But, Hey!  Gyro IS a pita. I expected a reasonable execution. Heck, make a Gyro meatloaf and slice it up at least.  Yes, I'm bitter."
5,"These are simply the BEST sandwiches and salads. If you like your food (a) locally grown; (b) freshly made; (c) organic/all natural; and (d) yummy - and who doesn't? - this is the place for you. Now, admittedly they have something of a soup-nazi routine set up and if you walk in and don't know the drill, it can be confusing.  So pay attention:    1.  Look at menu. 2.  Decide what you want. 3.  Wait your turn to order. 4.  Order (give your name). 5.  Wait your turn to be called to pay the other girl for the order you placed. 6.  Pay her. 7.  Wait until your food is ready. 8.  Leave with your food. Note that there is no place to sit inside - so you can either sit outside, or, (if it is 157 degrees out that day), see if you can find a place to sit over at LUX, they are very welcoming of Pane Bianco diners.  It's all good."
5,"The food is EXCELLENT!  We have been 5 times now, and everything we have had has been delicious!  We will continue to dine w Bill and IL Bosco!  The Caprese is AWESOME!"
3,"Set in a restored 1913 bungalow, Cibo (pronounced ""CHEE-boh"") has hardwood floors, exposed brick, a stained-glass panel and a fireplace to set the mood while revitalizing the downtown Phoenix area with beautiful salads, antipasto, artisanal pizzas and housemade fresh pasta.     I flew in for business on a Wednesday night. My friends picked me up and they decided to take me to Cibo.     Right off the bat, I was impressed with the ambiance this place exudes. Every corner of this place is romantic. Great for small parties, or just two.     We were seated outside at a table for four. The server was very well versed with the wine list, and the menu. She right away offered some appetizer ideas, and wine parings. All good offerings. We decided on a bottle of Vipra rossa. It was over all a good wine, and went well with dinner. Also we ordered the 3 Pair Buschetta. This little gem was awesome. It came to our table on a cutting board type platter. Three little buschetta slices each having a different topping. First was grape tomatoes and basil, the second had cannelini beans, and the third had prosciutto crudo and mozzarella. Ah Mazz ING.      Being that I wasnt feeling super adventurous on the meal, I just ordered the Diavola pizza for one. Average pizza I'd have to say, was not very inventive. Good presentation though.    Service was a five."
3,"My experience at Old Town Tortilla Factory is probably very different than that of the average patron. I dined here with a semi-private party with 40 other guests and we were served buffet-style. Our group was seated in their outdoor dining area, which I absolutely loved. I thought the atmosphere was great and brought an authentic Southwest feel and vibe to the restaurant. The food was as decent as you would expect sharing buffet-style with 40 other people lined up outdoors: nothing mind-blowingly memorable, but nothing too bad, either. My one complaint would be the servers. Especially at our single table of 8, it did not seem the server we were assigned was equipped to take care of a large group. There was much unnecessary confusion at the end of the night when it came down to settling some bar tabs. Overall, it did not ruin our experience, but definitely took away from the overall positivity.  Regardless, I would love to come back here with a smaller group and enjoy a fresh plate of food! The outdoor dining is definitely something you can't pass up..."
5,"Ok so us 5 hot chix got all dolled up for dinner at City Hall it was about 7 when we arrived on Saturday. The service was top notch from the get go starting with the valet. We were seated by a pleasant hostess in the large main room. Our waiter was an entertaining gentleman, that's one huge plus I have to say about Mastro's is they ""usually"" have seasoned wait staff they really know their product. They brought us the great basket of warm breads, we ordered bottled water for all and a bottle of some 06 Sauv Blanc that was mighty tasty. It was impossible to have an empty glass this night! Everyone had fillet's but me of course, I mainly had apps, side's, wine and desert ;) I did try the seared ahi tuna it was ok I wasn't too impressed with it though. Beefsteak tomato & mozz (see pics) very yummy! The creamed corn, sauteed asparagus and mash were all very good!! I couldn't talk anyone into the lobster mash or any caviar boohoo me. =(  Everyone loved their meal!! My g/f was coming back from the bathroom and missed a step or something somehow she lost her shoe but there was a busser or someone right behind her he picked it up for her and even put it back on for her! Now that is what I call 5 Star Service!! We had creme brle they served it with various fresh berries and a huge bowl of their fresh made whip cream yum-gasm's were had all around. While Mastro's is not my top choice since I am not a ""Steakhouse kinda girl"" it was all good stuff. They always play some  Michael Bubl and who doesn't just love him!?! It was about 3 bills total and we went home with doggy bags and full tummy's. P.S.  I had their sweet potato fries they were good but I like the ones at Fez better....just sayin. (O_o)"
5,"Never thought I'd review a supermarket, but since it's tough times for alot of people out there, I'd like to share my 2 cents.. First of all, you don't need a card.  The deals are for everyone and it makes it hassle-free during checkout.  Now, about the deals ~ I find that Albertsons has the lowest prices and best deals and you can find them amonst any product you're looking for.  It's WAY cheaper than Safeway for sure. This is what i found yesterday:  88 cents for 2 (yes two!) snicker bars or other comparable chocolate bars, $1 for a bag of lifesavor hard candies, and $14.99 for a 24 bottle case of coors light.  They also had 69 cent bags of frozen veggies that people were buying like crazy.  Also, this location has really good cuts of meat.  I'm Korean and was so excited that they had short ribs cut perfectly for Kalbi jjim (korean braised shortribs), and for $3.99 a pound, it was quite a deal!"
5,"Haven't been to a Vietnamese restaurant since I left Colorado, almost three years ago. But for what it's worth, this is the best, most authentic Vietnamese cuisine I've had so far. =)"
4,"Great little sushi spot with a heck of an all-u-can eat deal.  I like it.  The staff is great, the food is great quality and the prices are fair.  My only complaint: Nearly every time I leave Sushi Q I get hit up by the pan handlers working the liquor store next door.  4 stars for price, quality, and staff."
5,Love this place.  Buffalo chicken breast on a pretzel bun was amazing. Love the atmosphere too!
4,"A little pricey for my liking, but good nonetheless.  I really like the feel of the restaurant: part Cuban, part Puerto Rican, part Spanish, all classy.  A guitar player jammed away in a completely non-annoying way while we ate our meal and, to me, that is an accomplishment. Our Calypso Chips were outstanding.  To die for.  One of the best appetizers I can think of at the moment.  For my entree, I ordered the Ropa Vieja which was made up of the most perfectly tender beef and tasty rice with beans.  A little heavy with the peppers, however. Does anybody else think plantains smell like feet?  My date pointed this out and, although I was surprised, I'm inclined to agree.  That won't stop me from putting some into my stomach as soon as humanly possible."
3,"Finding this quaint location wasn't to hard... i like that there is a parking lot right north of the place... as well as street parking :)  you walk in the place and wow... its a completely different atmosphere... low lighting but in a calming way rather than creepy...  they have a DJ.. the music makes the setting but to be honest it was a little odd for my taste,,,  Our waitress was very nice and helpful... automatically served us cucumber water... (which tastes amazing!!) and then asked for our drink orders ... a good waitress can seriously turn everything upside down or completely make your visit ya know... its a pet peeve of mine.. customer service...  every table had a pink candle lit... pink lights hung above the chefs area... it was just so relaxing! the mirrors on the wall around this cool looking splatter painting... i was diggin it...  everything on their menu is served as appetizers... which kinda sucks.. they are all at least 6-12 bucks at least ... from what i saw.. and the waitress said that they recommend for people to get at least 2-3 a piece.... wow, on top of drinks.. its kinda pricey to me.. good thing we shared everything...  the lemongrass chicken (cant remember the full title) was amazing!! so good... the gyozo (dumplings) were alright.. a little too minty for my taste... we had this other thing where they bring you the hot stone and you cook your own meat... it was alright but the stone only stayed hot enough to cook the meat med rare... i don't like my meat to moo at me... so its was alright... but i prefer it well done...  the beef wrapped in grape leaves.. well i was soo excited to try them.. but was sadly disappointed... they were so fiery hot (spicy) that i almost had tears in my eyes... never did it say on the menu .. SPICY... after a server came over and saw us gasping for water.. he filled us up and said, oh yea those are pretty spicy... wow good thing i had my TUMS lol  over all  The atmosphere was amazing.....  the staff was fabulous...  the food... eh...  the menu is crap... if your gonna serve spicy food you should say its spicy! isn't that some sort of health hazard?!  and its kinda on the pricey side...  i think i would go back again... But i don't think i would opt to...  there are alot more dishes i would like to try... maybe a different location would be better?"
4,"My sister and I went today for brow waxes. The establishment is spotless. Cleanliness is really important to me. My esthetician was Alexandra. She was very professional and explained everything she did before she did it. I've had many waxes and know the procedure, but it was a nice touch.  When we arrived for our appointments we were told about their package prices. I'm a pay-as-you-go type person so I declined. It was not a hard sell and I really appreciated that. I made a follow up appointment in 2 weeks."
5,"God Bless Lifetime Fitness. First off, let me tell you how much I despise working out.  Like, at times I'd rather drink my own pee than even come within 50 feet of the stair stepper.   However, LTF (have you noticed that I like to abbreviate?  Get used to it friends...)  makes my gym experience fairly painless.  Steve W, I salute you for aknowledging the value of such a fine work-out establishment, and I actually have many of the same opinions. But because I like to hear myself talk, I'll reiterate some of my favorite points. First off, I'm absolutely not a fan of children.  Especially at a gym.  Lifetime has FREE childcare for kiddos 12 and under so us singles can flirt our way through our workout without your kids sniffling and screaming.  Kids can play and swim outside under parental supervision at the pool, complete with waterslides and some kid-specifc water fountain spray thing.  They love it.  And I do too.  WATERSLIDES?  I mean come on.  LoveitLoveit. Lifetime's members span the board, which is nice because I like the fact that I'm not the most out of shape person there.  I also like that there is nice scenery to watch and inspire me to keep my feet on that god forsaken stair stepper.  You may even see a professional athelete or TV personality on occasion.  Who doesnt love that? You never wait for a piece of equipement because there are tons of machines.  And they are not covered in meathead sweat, which is always nice. My favorite part of LTF is the group classes.  Excellent teachers, classes every day of the week, and a good variety of options.  I'd like to see more coreographed classes like Hip-Hop, but whatever, Kickboxing Jam is pretty damn close.    Locker rooms are always spotless, towel service is free, sauna and steam rooms arent full of weirdo naked people, and they have this device that dries your bathing suit in under a minute.  Ingenious!   I've been a member of a ton of Scottsdale gyms but I drive the extra 20 minutes in rush hour to go to the Tempe LTF.  Doesnt road rage burn calories anyway??  Win-win situation."
5,"Went here before a Phx Suns game. DELICIOUS! Everything on the menu looked amazing. I forgot what it was called, but the open-faced steak sandwich was my favorite! All the dishes were even presented nicely! Will definitely eat here again!"
4,"A bit pricey, yet one of the best breakfast sandwiches you will find.  Parking is slim."
5,"Every time I go into this place its with good times and cheery mates and I leave the wiser with a pint of fresh brew and some of the best food.  To make a great date, go to the Phoenix Rock Gym first and then climb the ladder on the back wall and walk in around the back...Great times for every one!"
4,"Excellent Excellent Excellent...  My wife and I try to eat here at least 3 -4 times a month.  Owners are very nice to chat with.  We planned a trip to Thailand this fall, and the owners help tell us where to go and what to see."
5,"I live in the townhomes right next to this restaurant and it still took me 4-5 months to actually try it. Absolute blasphemy as I see it now. This is a charming little place, decor outdated enough that it's sweet again, friendly servers, and man, great food. The pesto cream sauce ravioli (I believe) will blow you away. The wine glasses are filled high. Everything is great quality. Prices are medium-range, most dishes ranging from $11-18 but coming with a salad or soup and bread. This would be a great, great date night spot."
5,"My husband & I are addicted to Cherryblossom's ramen. Mr. T is Japanese & I lived in Japan for @4 years, so take my word it's authentic. The mix of foods is not so strange if you're familiar with restaurants in Japan. The ramen is Hakata style, made with a pork broth & may be heavy/oily for some people, so why not please everybody? Be sure to ask for ""Cha Shu Ramen"" to get a few more pieces of pork. (extra $) The salads are also fantastic; warm lightly fried (10?)Shrimp on a fresh spring mix base with mango dressing,  Shanghai Duck salad, and the Chicken Caesar was perfect, not heavily dressed like some ""roadhouses.""  Mr. T & our daughter loved the Eggplant in Miso Sauce, & even the California Roll was good. It's said Japan took the best of each country's cuisine. So there are French pastries, German beer, Italian pasta, and Indian curries. Save the banana bread for dessert if you can, or get one of their pastries. I've never have enough room. If you like good WHITE bread, buy one of the Pullman loaves on the table by the front door. My first extra 20 pounds in Japan came from the good bread! (No whole grain breads were available 30 years ago!) I think it's too small for groups over six. Maybe we'll see you there. Added 11/18/07 I think that their menus are not all alike, so if  ramen isn't on the menu you receive, you can still order it. (It's posted in Japanese on the wall.) For the basic, ask for ""Hakata Ramen."" For extra pork, ask for ""Cha-shu-men"" or ""Cha-shu-ramen."" Either way, there's really not much pork in it. That's why you need a delicious shrimp or duck salad."
5,"Went back to True Foods ( i have been doing this a lot since my first trip) with my mom for dinner last week. It was amazing as always however this time was different. I tried a new menu item, the Bison burger ( i highly reccomend this) it was so tastey and very light for a burger. OMG! I want to say that this time was different because we had THE BEST SERVICE EVER! Our server Marcus was amazing. He was very informative, helpful, polite and everything you would expect from a server and then some. LOVE THIS CAT. Just thought I would give credit where it is due. Too many times you read about the negatives on service and not so often the positives. I work in a restaurant and know it's important for employers to know who their ""stars"" are. MARCUS is your star. A bright, and shiney star. lol Loves: Shitaki mushroom lettuce cups, Ahi sliders, Spaghetti Squash, Kale Salad, Raviolli, Green Tea, Coffe (black) and I always have to have the Banana chocolate Tart. Definitely ."
1,"This place is the classic bait and switch joint.  I ordered through the drive-thru and told the person I was ordering that I had a coupon for a ""buy one-get one free"" Chicken Tender Sandwich,  The bun was hard and not at all like the picture on the coupon. The two small tenders were extremely rubbery and looked like they had been retrieved from the trash can after they had been tossed for being under a heat lamp too long. The lettuce was the part that most people toss when cleaning and the tomatoes were thin and pale and looked like they had been genetically mutated . . .uhh, I mean grown.  This wasn't the first time the server manager did this to me. I should have known better. I used a coupon a while back there for a buy one, get one free breakfast burrito and asked that they prepare it to look like the picture that appeared on the coupon. My bad!  When I got down the road and reached into the bag to take a bite, the cook had apparently taken an onion and diced it up super fine and threw that in with it.  If you want a decent hamburger or chicken sandwich without attitude and that looks as advertised or better, go to smash burger. As for this place, never, never  again.  The only good Carl's Jr. I have found in the valley so far is off the Superstition (Hwy 60) and Tomahawk.  From the Manager down, they strive to live up to their advertising."
1,"After a day full of meetings, I gathered the hubster and we headed out to eat some Mexican. I had visions of chips/salsa, and margaritas. We headed to On the Border on Stapley near Baseline but found that this location had closed. Egads. Then we remembered The Salty Senorita across the street. And thus begins the saga. ""Hi, are you here for happy hour?"". We said no but were seated in the bar area anyway. At least we got a booth. Lucky us, huh? Joe ""lots of product in his hair"" brought us menus and took our drink orders. He was pushing a certain type of Tequila and I took the bait, with the stipulation ""on the rocks with salt"". My drink, and hubster's water arrived and we ordered. The chips and salsa AND our dinners arrived at the same time. .Really Joe product??? Chips with the meal? FYI, chips and salsa here aren't complimentary, you have to order and pay for them. It was then we noticed ants had taken over our table. At first we thought it was just a couple but noooooooo. The hubster brought the ants to the attention of Joe product and he feigned concern but did not offer to sit us at another table. Now the hubster's getting annoyed. It's hard to enjoy yourself when you are swashing ants off the table. Our booth was by a window but we didn't see any influx from the window of ants, so we're not sure where they are coming from, but they don't stop. Hubster mentions it a second time, and then, again with feigned concern he offers to move us to a different table. By this time we are almost done eating and I just say let's finish and get the hell out of dodge. Our bill comes, we pay, and hubster asks for the manager. Hell, he's even younger than Joe Product and looks like he just woke up, thus we'll call him Bed Head. Bed Head offers to buy us a drink on the house? Really? That's your solution? He said he'd make sure other patrons aren't seated in this area. Egads, no thanks, we just wanted to leave. We weren't after free food, but the offer of 10% off or some kind of compensation for sharing our entire meal with ants would have been appreciated. A free drink? Hey,maybe one of those $60.00 margaritas would have made everything alright! As far as the food goes-I had the chicken antchiladas (get it, lol) with beans and rice and they were dry. I like my enchiladas with oodles of sauce and cheese, and these had very little sauce with a little design of sour cream on them. Hubster had a steak and avocado salad. He said it was ok.  This is a never return place for us.  And a note to Joe Product-chips and salsa should have arrived WITH the drinks, and before the meal.Reflecting back, we were there on Earth day so perhaps having ants share our meal was relevant. The margarita gets a 7 out of 10 limes as it was pretty good."
3,"I've been to Silver Spoon once, I need to go back to really make the decision if I like it or not.  I went in the summer, it was kinda hot in there-- like most places in the summer but, the heat makes me grumpy.  SO I need to go back when the weather is normal. I got a salad-- it was massive, a little too much dressing for my liking.  Okay, A LOT of too much dressing but I ate it anyway.  I'll probably try something else next time.  The staff was nice, the snarky guy that someone mentioned was snarky, buy snarky in a fun loving way, at least that is how I took it.  Snarky can come off all wrong and bad if not done correctly or if you just aren't in the mood for it, or if you yourself is snarky too-- then it's a disaster.   It's close by my work so the fact that I have not returned makes me keep it at a 3 star review."
4,"Out doing some shopping w/the Ms, Stopped in for a quick bit to eat & WoW was the place packed! She had never been & I had to see the Hostess for a table, when two seats at the bar opened up. Now my honey doesn't useually like sitting at the bar stools as she has a bad back but we were kind of in a hurry, as is everyone this time of year. I hadn't been in a Chompies since 1980...WoW what a mistake, I forgot how damn quick the service was & how GOOD the food was!!!! My girl even said the bar stools were comfrotable & that this was here new favorit place! I will be back soon!"
5,"Oooh, this is my favorite lunch place by my office.  Super nice staff, delicious bagels.  Go for the lox special thing, it's amazing."
5,"Excellent service!!!! I had to find a spa different from lavenders after they got rid of yet another excellent staff member, so I tried this place! I was SO HAPPY!! clean, pleasant, warm, comforting. The manager is actually on site and aware of the things going on in their spa! The staff is friendly and efficient!  Lavenders day spa can learn from this place. Send the owner from lavenders to sanity and TAKE NOTES.  I HIGHLY recommend it here!!!!!! Go and enjoy!!!"
1,NOTE: This review concerns the Roberto's on Union Hills and 7th Ave. NOT the Roberto's in Anthem! I am only giving it one star because I can't give it 0. Simply put i was very sick after dining there recently. This was the only meal I did not share with my family and therefor the only culprit to my food borne illness. I have enjoyed this place in the past but recently the quality has gone downhill. Now they are closed on Sunday's. I wish i had read recent reviews on here before i had gone. they have slipped VERY far since there Diners Drive-ins and Dives days.  the guy that both took my order and cooked my food was obviously drunk. sitting on his cellphone playing what appeared to be a video game when i walked in.
3,Pizza crust & toppings are excellent. However the pizza sauce was too salty. I'm willing to try again later.
4,"I stayed here with my family (3 people in 1 room) for 3 nights.  What first attracted us was the rate, but what made us happy with the choice was the cleanliness, coolness (literally--good air conditioning), and accessibility of the hotel.  It's wheelchair accessible.  The best part of the hotel is the staff.  The front desk team was incredibly helpful--much more so than you typically see at a chain hotel--and they gave us regular maps/handouts as well as printouts that were tailored individually for our needs.  Even more astounding, though, was the cleanliness of the room: the staff cleaned the room so well after our first night that when we returned on day two, it looked like we had just walked into the room for the first time.  (In my experience, most hotels do a better clean-up job in between guest stays rather than do a good job every single day, but these folks are the exception.) Reasonable, hot breakfast.  Eggs, swine, cereals, pastries, juice, milk, coffee, fruit, yogurt...  You've had it a million times, but they do it just fine. The definition of 4 stars is ""Yay!  I'm a fan.""  And that's true.  Didn't give it 5 stars because it's not ""Woohoo!  As good as it gets!"" to me--mostly a product of the location and lack of distinctiveness as a hotel experience--I would only give 5 stars to an excellent ""destination hotel,"" and that's not this place."
1,"Sadly, I'm giving this place one star and an explanation why it is only getting one star.  The Manger/operator guy. Sure, the food here isn't all that bad.  Probably a half a notch or so higher than most of the hot slop fast food you can get for lunch.  Most of the crew members are pretty attentive, don't seem to be meth addicted, and I see them cleaning the tables on a regular basis.  Looks like the crew changes over quite often, and I know why. My beef is not with the crew members, oh no.  Not with the food or cleanliness of the store.  Nope.  The Manager guy, the guy who looks like a real pussy version of John Leguizamo.  This guy ruins about every trip I have to this joint.  That is my problem with this joint.  Elaboration will proceed now. This guy is without a doubt one of the biggest assholes I have ever encountered in the fast food industry.  Actually, one of the biggest assholes period.  What a douche bag.  Seems like any time I have a coupon, this guy will literally butt in the middle of the order, give me a ration of shit and do about anything possible not to use it.  Seriously, what is it, 30 cents?  I had a store coupon that was on a tray liner a while ago and this nutsack got in the middle of the order, cancelled it and refused to let the coupon be used.  I asked why and he said it was not legit (why was it on the tray liner then fuckhead?) I checked the menu, they would have lost 10 cents.  Lady taking my order after P.J.L. (pussy John Leguizamo) walked away pretty embarassed said ""sorry""  Not her fault.  Never saw her working there after then, was probably tired of that guys shit.  I don't blame you. Last trip here, they have promos on their drink cups for free shit.  Awesome.  We all know this is the garbage that costs them nothing but I am a sucker for something free.  On my trip before the last, I got one for a free corndog.  SCORE!  I cash it in on my last trip, and the guy ringing up the order said it would be on a different ticket.  No sweat, I could give a shit less as long as I get my corndog.  Go to get my order, ask where the corndog is.  P.J.L. butts in the middle of the order, says ""This is your order, this is what you have"" and was a fucking prick about it.  Me, the customer.  Yanks the receipt out of my hand, gives me an attitude about it.  Who the fuck talks to a customer like that, even at a low rent fast food joint?  Fuck you.  Seriously.  The guy who took my order tried to explain the situation and dicknose literally looks at him, puts his hand in front of the guys face, and says ""ssssshhhhhh"" and snaps his fingers the same way I do to my dogs to keep them barking or eating drywall.  Who degrades their employees like that?  All he was trying to do was explain my free item was on another ticket.  Instead of listening, he made a complete asshat out of himself.  It was a corndog, what does that cost you anyway, about 12 cents in batter, a stick, and a combination of horse eyeballs and badger penis meat?   Dude (cashier guy, tattoo on your arm), tell that guy to get fucked and get a better job.  No one deserves that shit.  I am actually ashamed I didn't say something for you, I truly am. What would have normally gotten a decent review is what it is.  My rant speaks for itself.  One shithead ruins it for the ones working for him.  For the ones working there, I will pray for you.  You need it.  P.J.L., get out of there and become a pimp in Tijuana, they need midget controlling assholes over there.  You would do great at that."
4,"This is the best venue in the valley for what is intended to be; a midsize venue that attracts national touring acts, with a standing room only intimacy that you won't get at a place bigger or smaller. I saw Clutch here recently, and it rocked my balls off. I didn't drink at the place (took care of that before and after) so I can't comment on drink prices. Parking did suck, but there was a structure across the street for five bucks. One downside, going to the website to check out upcoming shows is tedious. The calendar is soooo hard to sort through, I would only go there to get more info on opening bands not listed on ticketmaster.com"
5,"I don't think I've ever been to this place when it's not been crazy busy. It's just a small little eatery, but it's always busy. They have some great food and the peanut butter pie is delicious. Just a place to hang out and enjoy some breakfast, lunch, dinner or snacks at. Parking isn't the best and that is a problem, but if you live close and can walk, its ideal."
4,"Is it worth the trip for a Chirico and Egg sandwich from Chaka Chaka, heck yes!!!!"
1,"I usually do not complain about bad food but the fish and chips gave my wife a serious case of food poisoning.  So if some manager reads this please check out your fish supply or change the cooking oil.  She never gets sick and has been sick all day (December 29, 2012) from the meal eaten December 28, 2012."
5,i love trader joe's!!!  i think they're selection of products are just GREAT!!! i can't get enough of it. the place is clean and the people are friendly. it's right next to michaels which is also great. it's in a convenient place. it seems like the people there are nutty-crunchy which i love!!
4,"I've been here so many times, I can't believe I haven't reviewed Black Bear yet! This is me and my friend's ""go-to"" breakfast place. Ginormous portions, and for a decent price. A little slow on the service, but if you're not in a hurry it's no big deal. Basically down home cooking. You see diner and that is exactly what you get. Good eats!"
5,"Be sure to see Taylor, her service is great, the food is awesome, had roast beef sandwich ...and a plank of bruschetta!  But without good service the experience lacks. Be sure to try it out."
5,"i just finished licking my fingers clean and almost ate the dressing-drenched paper that held my very first, and surely not last, lucky boy international burger. crispy bun, tons of dressing, fresh lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and onions, and a perfectly tender, smokey burger. thick, perfectly salted, crunchy on the outside and soft and burning hot on the inside fries. thick and deliciously sweet chocolate and peanut butter shake. gone. in less than 5 minutes. place closes early, so unfortunately there will be no drunk trips through the dangerously narrow drive thru."
4,"BEST CARNE ASADA (GRILLED SLICED STEAK), HACIENDA-STYLE HOSPITALITY. A MEXICAN FOOD EXPERIENCE IN THE THEME-PARK STYLE. --colorful, tasteful, vibrant ambiance in the country-hacienda style; kudos to the designers with an eye for detail; --dining room draws natural light from the delightful patio windows to the vaulted ceilings above; --this place and the adjacent ranch market are a ""must-do"" for tourists (bring your out-of-towners here); --Don't miss the Parrilla (grilled platter); one ""portion"" serves two; choose three meats and voice your tortilla preference; --grilled vegetables include nopales (cactus), Mexican zucchini squash, jalapenos (consumed whole, took me to five hiccups before my stomach settled), and baby onion stalks (not the typical pile-o-fajita yellows); --both rice and beans served family style, and perfectly flavored. I could just sit and eat bowl after bowl of those beans; --juicy, perfectly cooked shrimp; ""asada"" goodness knows no bounds; --guacamole is plentiful (no melon-ball scoops of yesterday at $3/ea here!) and freshly made to order; NOW THAT'S what I'm TALKing about !!! --table salsa is spicy with lots of freshly chopped chilis and pureed onions; really good burn; --try the horchata (rice milk and cinnamon sugary goodness) or any of the featured Aguas Frescas. --no fuss over separate checks (and that was for our table of 10!) --pork was a bit dry; is ""gamey"" possible in pork? --server forgot our desserts and we gave up after 20 minutes (shucks! they were sitting right there on the pass!); the manager refunded us promptly and then packaged them to-go. After so many recent disappointments on rock-hard rubbery shrimp, I _finally_ found a place that grills properly, excellent marinade, and with the freshest ingredients. If you get the impression that you are amidst a food operation staffed by thousands, you are correct: several hundred are working in the kitchens next door making tortillas, cheese, asada, aguas and more! If you don't have a filthy-rich Mexican relative with a hacienda (Mexican mansion) across the border, this may be the closest you'll get without an invitation. The mostly-abandoned courtyard is centered with a gigantic fountain, lined with what could be booths for a seasonal market, bodas, or other festival. In the corner a lush garden with a somewhat secret door leading to la sala, the grand room. Don't miss the Ranch Market next door; you won't see retail food sold in this quantity anywhere else in town. Take your camera."
2,"I don't get it. Not the concept of a good vegetarian restaurant but the need to create mock this and mock that. The word mock appears on the menu no less than 30 times, and that made me want to flee pell mell at mach 1 out of there, sonic boom be damned. I understand it from a  marketing strategy to appeal to and or convert the carnivores and omnivores I suppose. Do meat eaters feel better about eating something vegetarian as long as it is shaped like a chicken wing? Has anyone gone to a steak joint and had mock carrots made from pork medallions?  I am also aware that we eat with our eyes, have preconceived notions of certain types of cuisine etc. However, I firmly believe that if an establishment uses veggies, legumes, tofu and such and gets creative instead of trying to reinvent the meat wheel, the end result would be much better. For Example the Mexicali burger, no mock meat reference here. How about listing something as ""whatever the hell it is"" served Parmesan style?    I stopped here for lunch yesterday as I was in the area. Cool space, it was open colorful and inviting. A couple of organs line a small space up front. Nice mild funk flavor to the decor. Ordering is done counter style and they bring it out to you. You pretty much go behind the counter to get ice for your beverage which I thought was a bit of a weird queue.  I ordered the spicy Thai peanut, a dish that offered mock choices, but I went with the crispy tofu. The brown rice that was the bedding here was ok, lukewarm at best. the dish lacked any real flavor and there was no spice whatsoever.The tofu tasted as if it was freezer burned, which really dumbfounded me. I think it may have been crisped long before it was served to me and microwaved, the texture was just off. Copious amounts of cock sauce, err... Sriracha saved it from blandsville. I am not saying I would never return, as I tend to give places more than one chance. I love well prepared vegetarian dishes, just don't mock me."
5,"How many great things can one say about the Cartel? Does Infinity work! Yes, that was a statement, not a question. I am in love with the CC, hands down. I have traded my gold Starbucks card in for this amazingly Delicious start to my day. The iced coffee ( actually, its Toddy, which is better) is amazing. They roast their own beans, and allow the iced coffee to sit over night, creating an extremely potent concoction. The hot drinks, A+++ as well. And, the food? A+++++ (5, yup its that legit). Grab the cheddar bacon muffin... its literally heaven. No joke. Heaven. Little clouds may form above your head; white clouds of course! Not those nasty rain clouds. OK, maybe not clouds. But defiantly your day will be sunny because you stopped into Coffee Cartel. And not because you live in AZ. Duh.  Only complaint I have is the hours. I live right next door, and their only open M-F (like so many places in DT-Pho).  PLLLEEEEAAAASSSEEEEEE open up for the weekends!!! I'll work for free! Well...wait... I'll come visit."
5,"This place is excellent.  Hands down, the best tacos I've had.  Fresh and flavorful meats and great salsas.  I see people raving about some of the ""salsa bars"" at all of the 'berto's and such but the salsa there is like water compared to what Tacos Atoyac has to offer.  They care about what they are serving and take pride in their craft. If you like the style of food here you must try Sonora Mesquite Grill on 46th Street and Thomas."
5,"I have been living in Arizona for 4 years and have yet to find a decent Italian Beef Sandwich, until now.  I even gave the same statement to the owner.  I had ordered an Italian Beef for carry out, and while I was waiting, I let him know my frustrations.  He gave me his card and told me to call him after I ate the sandwich because he wanted to know what I thought.  Well, it was FANTASTIC!  Of course, I called him back to let him know.   The service, and the time and effort put into the food cannot be beat.  This is what you get for a mom and pops type place.   There are plenty of other sandwiches and foods there too.  I can't wait to go back and try some more!"
5,"A great place for midday healthy food, thin crust good pizza ( try wild mushroom & arugula), salads are great too & the best part that serve pretty acceptable nice wines. It is not an average American food eatery, it is definitely for those who are looking for healthy low calorie lunch."
4,"I couldn't find anything to add to the previous review except I have never had a bad experience here no matter who did my nails. They are reasonably priced, friendly and one of the few nail salons I have been to that seem genuinely interested in the customer returning. The owners are friendly and the selection of acrylic colors offered is excellent. If your a magazine reader you might want to bring your own as they only have people and entertainment mags, however I've only had to wait once in nearly a year."
5,"I had a great burger experience here and intend to return the next time I am craving a Fuddburger. I also got to introduce a friend to Fuddrucker's for the first time, so it was a cherry-poppin' adventure. Not only are the burgers here tasty, but I love the fact that you get to pick and choose the toppings from their self-serve produce and condiment bars. One of my favorite things on french fries is Heinz 57 sauce and Fuddrucker's is truly awesome for including that amongst its vast condiment selection. As a professed condiment whore, I was thrilled to discover a new flavor of Tabasco I have never encountered before... and I like to think I really know my Tabasco products, having lived in Louisiana for years. This Fuddruckers special-orders the Sweet & Spicy variety of Tabasco which is not only great on a burger, but would work as an egg-roll dipping sauce. Knowing that I must have it for home use, my dining partner graciously approached the manager who arranged to allow him to purchase a bottle. This was just one example of how efficient, helpful, and friendly the staff here are. Next visit, I will demand to meet the one who refers to himself only as ""Mr. Crusty Baker"" (see photos). The restaurant also has a lot of shiny fun decor evoking shameless Americana and Route 66 roadside culture. The bright colors and the overindulgence in fast food goodness contributes to a heightened state of arousal that can only be described as a ""Burger Party Contact High"". You can just feel the burger love... the afterglow punctuated by the difficult click of the seat belt as you strap in for a ride back to a somber, less-gluttonous reality."
4,"I was pleasantly surprised by Sauce. We went here for dinner last night, and wanted something quick, tasty and casual. Done. I think of it as a cross between a fast food place and a pizzeria. I had the Pepperoni and Crimini Mushroom pizza, and it was great. The crust is amazingly thin yet perfect for the pie. The center where the toppings are is a nice and soft but the edges are super crispy with a chip-like ""crunch"". The sauce and toppings were noticeably fresh and perfectly proportioned on the pizza. M had the Turkey salad, and she too was very pleased. I can describe hers much - as we both stuck to our plates! The waitstaff was very pleasant and everything came out well; however nothing really blew me away to earn that 5th star."
3,"I've grown to like Apple, though I've always thought their products were priced on the rich side.  When we lived in Seattle there was a Microsoft bias, but a large group of us all had Apple iPhones.  And that is a key part to the Apple story.  You buy the iPhone and then the next thing you know, you're looking at iPads.   The Genius Bar is fun and very helpful when things go wrong; like when my new phone duplicating one calendar entry 341 times.  I had to bring in my Win-Tel PC into the Genius Bar and in the end we had to delete MobileMe to fix it.   But, absolutely great, GREAT customer service!!! I love my new iPhone 4, and I've had Blackberries for 14 years!  Maybe when they add FaceTime to the iPads, I'll belly up to the Genius Bar."
5,"I indulged big time at Indulge Burgers & More during Fat Tuesday yesterday.  There are a tremendous variety, including many healthy options such as a turkey or veggie burger.  The best part I like is that you can build your own burger with all sorts of yummy toppings.  I had the turkey burger, and the turkey was one of the best I have ever tasted.  Sometimes you can taste like of the darker meats and fatty parts, but I felt like this burger was very clean and lean.  I would highly recommend the sweet potatoe fries that you can order.  You can deep those fries in what tastes like a warm marshamallow dip.   The price is not too bad either for what I call a luxury burger."
4,"Boyfriend and I went to try Lobby's after seeing the phenomenal reviews.  He got the famous Italian beef sandwich hot with cheese and I got the little veggie sandwich and an order of the chili cheese fries. He got his in a combo that came with a side of fries and a drink. The owner was there and took our order and he was suuuuuuuper nice.  He was really excited for new people to try his food.   We went and grabbed a table and just as we sat down, a rush of people came in.  There must be a lot of regulars because he was greeting some by name. There must be something to this food for that many loyal customers.  Not too long after we got our drinks, the food was ready. I decided to immediately dive into the chili cheese fries. The cheese was like the melty nacho kind (not spicy though) and the chili was actually kind of sweet. I wasn't the biggest fan of the chili. My boyfriend did like it and he doesn't usually like chili. I'd probably just get cheese or plain fries next time.  The little veggie sandwich was so tasty! It was lettuce, tomato and pickles (I didn't want onions) with their house sauce on a sesame seed bun.  I'd love to try a burger next time. The boyfriend did like his sandwich except he didn't know it was going to be ""dipped"".  He doesn't like his sandwiches dipped, so if he were to get that again, he would request it dry.  The sandwich was hearty (I added a pic) and very filling. He kept stealing my chili cheese fries so I take it he liked those too.  It was really bright and clean in there and the owner and the guy making the food were really cool.  I'd definitely come back. We both want to try the burgers next time. Although....the hot dog with all the stuff does look damn tasty too...."
1,"I keep wanting to like this place.  I want to support a local business, and yet.... Last year I took my two boys there after a theater performance (Greasepaint!   Excellent!), and after we placed our orders for lunch, I took out our SET game (it's a card game that does not use a traditional deck - great fun).  WIthin moments, the server was back at our table.  ""You can't do that.""  ""What?  Play cards?  It's not gambling."" (Maybe I was wrong, but living here, you start to assume that an objection to something must be religion based).  ""The owners don't allow it.""  ""They don't allow it?  It's a matching game.""  ""No.  You'll have to put it away."" Now.  I would understand not wanting us to sit and play cards if we'd finished eating and were just holding a table (assuming it was busy).   However, this was during the gap between ordering and eating.  I KNOW I should've just left then.  Instead, I made my kids happy and we stayed for lunch (and ice cream!).   A couple months ago I (foolishly) decided to try again.  Didn't bother with the cards this time.  The lousy thing this time was the mold on my son's bread.  They DID remove the sandwich from the bill, but eish.     I'd kind of like the ""Restaurant Impossible"" guy to come in here and give it an overhaul.  I don't mind the nostalgia stuff, but the place does need a solid going over."
4,"I've heard way good stuff about this place for a while and finally had the pleasure of sitting down and having some lunch there. Thoughts: Staff was friendly and quick, nice place, very clean and some hi-tops and lots of tables and outdoor seating as well. Chicken salad bagel sandwich wasn't too bad at all, except for the nuts in it - I'd probably eat it again however.  Had a tomato basil bagel toasted with it... yum!  I'm wanting to go back to try different menu items now :)"
5,"I've been a patient of PFD for a few years, recommended by a friend, and have always been happy with the attention I've gotten. I actually go to the Gilbert location now, but I have been to the Tempe office once and had a good experience there.  It's a family owned business, I think they've been around for 30 years. They have always been pleasant and honest when talking teeth. I wanted to mention my hygienist specifically, Jackie. She is super nice, calm and gentle, which is important to me since I don't particularly like going to the dentist.  Check them out if you're in the market for a dentist."
4,"I went to Saba's feeling a little scared.  Fast food Greek in a strip mall?  This could go one of two ways...surprisingly good or health code violation bad.   I am very glad to say it didn't end being the latter.  In fact, the food here was pretty damn good.  I did expect Saba's to be an order at the counter joint, so I was a little disappointed to see it was actually a tiny restaurant.  I like my Greek fast and cheap, okay?  But I got over it, got a table and began the interminable wait for our server to stop chatting with other diners and take our order. The menu has all the normal Greek items, including falafel- little fried balls of joy I might add- gyros, vegetarian platters, spanakopita and dolmas.  Prices for the sandwiches and gyros are pretty cheap, but when you venture into the platter territory, you're going to pay for it. Platters start around $10 and go up.  I ordered the falafel, of course, and so did my boyfriend.  The pita sandwiches don't come with any sides, so we ordered a basket of fries to go along with our meal. The dcor was pretty cool with big pictures of Greece all over the walls and the classic Greek music piped in.  Unfortunately, not even the Greek music could mask the hideous, loud tool of a diner that was sitting at the table in front of me. He was one of those idiots that has to talk so loud, even the half-deaf cook in the kitchen can hear him.  He was so loud I felt like I should respond to his questions.  Hey moron- saying things like ""I like it loose, like my women,"" is just not funny. Anyways, when we finally got our food, it was really good.  The falafel pita and the fries were tasty, but our server sucked.  He obviously knew the loud tool, and kept chatting with him while we waited for our check.  That was a little annoying, but overall, Saba's is a good choice for a quick Greek meal."
4,"I am with some of the others in not understanding these poor reviews. I am from Rhode Island and Italian food is at our fingertips, and in Arizona, there are few and far between authentic non chain Italian restaurants. I feel that although ambiance is important, I didn't see anything wrong with Lo Cascio's. There were no cheesy paper protectors over a linen table cloth, and there were no paper place mats with several business names, so not sure what the issue was there. And as far as the music....I would be annoyed too if I had to work there every night, but again, it only added to the atmosphere. In my opinion, some of the best Italian food does not come with yuppie atmosphere.   For the appetizer we had the fried mozzarella which my husband and I enjoyed very much. The marinara poured over it was on the chunkier side and I loved it because it tasted just like a sauce an old Italian friend of mine made. It was perfect. I had eggplant parmesan for my entree, and it tasted just like NYC Italian. The eggplant didn't have the shit fried out of it, and it had the finest light coating just the way I love my favorite dish. And my husband had veal milanese which was out of this world. It was in a sauce of lemon and wine, mushrooms and artichokes.   I also want to mention, we had the most Attentive waitress that I have ever had. Her name is Katie, and she was very sweet always asking us after each course if we needed anything and how everything tasted.   We will definitely be back here, we live down the road now in our new home and I am very happy there is a great little Italian restaurant nearby. I am also happy I didn't let the negative reviews scare me."
4,"I am so in love with the exceptional level of service provided at this diamond in the rough naturopathic clinic! It may not look like much from the outside. Inside the unsurpassed warmth and tenderness is ideal for a deeply enriching, healing experience. I was gifted a 90 minute massage and was not disappointed. The masseuse was knowledgeable and hyper receptive to my needs. I walked in trapped in a bubble of negativity. When I left I was literally floating... I felt cleansed and utterly flawless. Another major plus was that the entire indulgent, spirit lifting experience was under $40. A professional, extraordinary 90 minute massage for under $40?! Seriously go for it!"
4,"We like this restaurant,  It is always good food and good service and convenient to our home."
5,"Seriously, if you're looking for a place to get your knives sharpened or buy some cool professional kitchen gear, look no further."
5,"This is the best ice cream I've ever had, bar none!  I had the salted caramel, and it was wonderful!  I felt like I was 7 years old and enjoying my first ever ice cream cone.  I also love the decor of the shop, the braille on the back wall is so cool (although I do wonder exactly what it says!)  I also bought a pint of their ice cream at Whole Foods, I love Sweet Republic and everything it stands for!  Totally recommended!"
3,"The 3rd star is because they have EVERYTHING.  And you can't beat the prices.  And as far as crowded, budget conscious mega stores, this is definitely on the cleaner side, even with their current renovation project going on. The dark side...  it IS a very crowded mega store, especially at the later hours.  And as crowded as it gets from 9pm-1am, there's usually only 2 checkers, which makes for LONG lines.   If you can hit this place during a quieter time, earlier mornings or early evenings, then you can get what you need without breaking the bank."
3,"Growing up in Tempe, I've been to the Rooste a few times. Overall, the experience is good but nothing to write home about. One of my recent visits was on New Year's Eve. I made a reservation ahead of time and the process was perfect. They said upon arrival, if there is a wait for tables we will be bumped to the top of the list. When we arrived, the hosting staff said it was going to be a 30 minute wait. I was a little confused but no point in causing a fuss because we didn't have a strict time schedule for the evening. We walked over to the outside patio to check on the view. Within 5 minutes our buzzer went off and we were seated. Our server was fantastic and friendly. The food was delicious with LARGE portions. And surprisingly not as expensive as i thought it would be. My next visit was about a week ago on a Saturday night. We forgot to make a reservation so when we arrived we found out it was going to be an hour wait. We waited maybe 30 minutes before we were seated. Our server, however, was not as wonderful as our visit before. It took 20 minutes to get waters and she kept blaming the bus boys for everything. The food this time was OK. My dad's prime rib came out cold, like it was straight from the fridge. All the side dishes were cold or overcooked. It was a less than stellar experience this time around. If I hadn't been here before, I certainly would not return. If you want to give it a shot, I'd say go for it but don't expect the best meal you've ever had. The view and atmosphere is what makes the restaurant."
3,"I'll go easy because they just opened this location. 1)  The onion ring batter won't stay on the onion.  The onion was a bit raw too.  Try soaking the rings for 24 hours in buttermilk.  Then coat twice.  Season the flour with garlic and pepper.  Works for me! 2)  The happy hour menu is weak!.  Pretty much chips and snacks type stuff.  Nothing good like sliders etc. 3)  The kids mac & cheese is out of a box.  Really guys?  It takes two seconds to make mac  & cheese from scratch.  Go to allrecipes.com if you need help. 4)  The burger meat is good in flavor but the burger lacks seasoning. 5)  The menu is way too big.  A scaled down menu with better quality would be better. 6)  The nachos are nasty with that queso cheese.  People love traditional nachos.  Stack them high and layer them with cheddar.  all the toppings.  You are a sports bar. 7)  IMO.. drop all of the steaks etc from the menu.  You're a sports bar.  Leave that to Mastros and Flemings.  People want GOOD bar food in a sports bar. Bottom line....  love the atmosphere, food is OK, beer was cold, price is a little high for what you get, menu is too big, quality of food is OK.  What would I do?  Interview a new fresh Chef to bring in some changes.   Good luck.  I'll stop by again for a happy hour and give you another try.  Cheers."
5,"New owners are awesome!!!!!  Good people, earnest in providing a great product with great service.  The restaurant is beautiful too.  My mouth starts watering right when I walk in the door.  Go check them out!!!!"
5,"I absoloutely love this place.  Great Coffee, Americanos, and Lattes.  Try the Chemex if you are looking for something unique.  Very Tasty Breakfast Burritos and friendly staff.  I wish the North Location was still open, but I'll take their brews anywhere I can get them.  Skip Starbucks and hit up a real coffee shop..."
5,"Very authentic, excellent Thai food and soothing ambience. And they have delivery! My favorites are the Fried Shrimp Rolls, Egg Rolls, Clear Noodle Soup, Pad Thai Chicken, Phad-See-Ew Beef, Papaya Salad, etc.. I love the Sweet Rice with Thai Custard. It tastes exactly like the Filipino custard I grew up with."
5,"INCREDIBLE food, relaxed/great atmosphere, perfect to bring kids/family...the cheeseburger, shredded bbq pork sandwich, sweet potatoes- too die for! Must try! Worth the drive!"
3,"I've been to Orange Table a few times and adore the venue, grocery and store. However, I have been less than impressed with the food. The first time I went for breakfast and had the Jersey Girl Omelet. It was good but not great. The next timeI had the mushroom pizza. It was so greasy that I had to go through multiple napkins and could only eat 1-2 small pieces before I gave it all to my friends. To sum it up, if you are looking for a chill place to hang out, people watch and do some small gift shopping it is a great place but don't do there for the food."
2,I went to Arriba last night with my wife and another couple.  I have been to this location a handful of times and always had the same result.  The food was okay but the main problem here is the super slow service.  It took us nearly two hours to eat dinner here.  It took forever to get our chips and salsa.  It took us nearly as long to get our drinks.  Forget about refills.    When our food finally arrived we asked for an additional plate but never got it.  I asked for a water when our food came out and got it after I was 3/4 done with my meal...and I do not eat fast.  Our waiter was friendly but hardly ever checked in with us.  When we asked for the check he said he would bring it in five minutes.  His five minute deadline was not met. I don't think I will be eating here again.  I have given them too many chances.
5,There is no shortage of Mexican restaurants in AZ and this one is one of the tops on my list.  It's not your average Mexican fast food.  It's a little more pricey but well worth it.  Their bean and cheese burrito is so good (they say no lard and I don't know what else they use to make it good).  Their carne asada and pastor tacos are done to perfection.  I stop by whenever I pass by this place.
1,"Tried Shorty's today, sadly it will be my one and only visit. To begin service was mediocre at best, portions are small(I thought my steakburger was a slider), and there was also the black facial hair that was in between the cheese and burger. That's when customer service went down the drain, all we got was a ""that's weird"" and an I'm sorry. If your running a joint and a customer finds a big hair in their food you do whatever you can to save that customer and make them want to come back. Something, not just sorry for your luck. I will stick with RocketBurger, just up the street, cheaper, bigger portions, tasty and most important, they got great service. If I had to sum it up for ya in a few words I'd say""DON'T DO IT""!!!!"
4,"I have heard great things about this place and I had purchased one of those online deals to try it out.  I was not disappointed.  The only reason, I didn't give it 5 stars was because I was freezing.  But I had a small chocolate milkshake and the special of the day, philly cheesesteak.  My husband had a cheeseburger slider, chili cheese dog, and french fries.  We really liked the food.  If you want the sliders, make sure you order at least 3, I would say, because they're kind of small. My husband is from Illinois, so walking into Chicago Hamburger Co, was amazing.  There is so much chicago decor, it's ridiculous, but since I've only been to chicago once, I liked reading all the signs and seeing pictures of former Bears players.   We will most defiinitely return."
3,After our fav Mongolian place closed I was set on having Mongolian the night we came across AJ's. It was decent.  It seemed a bit over priced.  The soft serve was kinda gross and the chocolate was out of order.  The all you can eat soup looked like it had been sitting there for a good 8 hours.  Will I go back? Maybe.  Was I impressed? Not really. Did I leave full? Yes.
5,"It's the best!  Downstairs, hanging at the bar, you can't beat it!   The food is EXCELLENT!!!"
3,"I love Greek food, but I need to stop letting my friends drag me to this restaurant. The staff is extremely friendly and the place is comfortable, but for me the food is always a disappointment. I know I know, it's a chain... and maybe I just have high expectations, being that I'm from back east where we have small family-run Greek restaurants on every corner."
1,"The absolute worse service I've encountered. My boyfriend, son and I sat at a tepan table, we were ignored for a good 15-20 minutes until my boyfriend had to ask the manager to please have someone get us something to drink. Once we had our drinks, it took another 20 minutes to order our food. By that time, another family sat at our table. My son & boyfriend ordered a meal from the tepan menu, I had sushi. Everyone on that table got their meal and I still didn't get my sushi. I asked the server to please bring it and she brought someone else's order, I had to wait another 20 minutes for my sushi. The family on our table were so upset for us as well.  The food is excellent, the service is so poor I am disappointed. I advise anyone who comes here to sit at the sushi bar and deal with the Chefs, they are great. I talked to the owner and she was just as bad as the servers.  I then gave it another try. I met my girlfriends there. We had dinner, spent over $200. We then moved over to the bar area and were completely forgotten about. We asked the manager/owner to please have someone come take care of us and we were told that they were concerned because we were drinking and had kids with us. One of my girlfriends had her kids but she was not drinking. I was offended that she tried to cover up the poor service with her so-called concern.  Again, food is great service is lousy. I am so disappointed and will not go back. I will look elsewhere for my Caliente Rolls. I hear Blu at the Wigwam is really good and servers are hospitable."
4,"Oh lawd!!! So, I'm a relative nevercomer to this cuisine. Like most people, I hear 'Szechuan' and I think 'just spicy Panda Express food'. Meh. I couldn't have been more wrong. I was in Atlanta with a friend, and he took me to a place that specialized in Szechuan cuisine. I had my first experience with Szechuan peppercorns there, and I was hooked. All I can say is, if you haven't already tried authentic Szechuan cuisine, then you owe it to yourself to give this place a shot. And if you HAVE, then you already know what I'm tombout and you probably already eat here all the time any damned ways.  Enough other reviews have touted the wonders of that amazing spice, the Szechuan peppercorn, so I'll let their words be the guiding lights of wisdom for that. What I'm gonna tell you is- I travel all over this great nation of ours, and this place delivers the goods, in the way that I want them. The food is inexpensive, it's reliable tasty, and it's exactly what it's supposed to be. Other people have complained about the service, and to that, all I can say is:  ""get over it"". It is what it is, and I haven't had any problems here. Their food is exactly what it should be, it tastes exactly like it's supposed to, and I love it. Still keeping an eye out for one of these Asian girl + white guy couples, though..."
5,"BEAUTIFUL! Phoenix doesn't get much more amazing then when you're looking down at her from Dobbins Lookout. A few tips: 1. Get there before 6pm. The park closes the entry but if you're in, you can stay as long as you want.  2. Be ready for a drive up a mountain -- scary cliffs and tight corners. Make sure you go slow, watch for hikers and cyclists, and overall be cautious. 3. If you're heading to the summit for the views (Dobbins Lookout) bring a jacket or blanket. It's cold and windy when the sun goes down, even in the summer. There are bathrooms but no water fountains at the Lookout."
4,My wife and I went here and sat on the patio near the canal. The temperature was perfect for being outside and the view of Camelback was sublime. My only complaint about the seating was it was difficult to read our menus when we were there in the evening. Our waiter was friendly and helpful. The chicken salad sandwich I had was very good and my wife loved the burger she ordered. All in all a very nice and relaxing Sunday evening dinner.
4,"After eating here I was actually pissed off that I didn't know about it before. The portions of sashimi are amazingly large. That doesn't mean crap if the quality is not there, but fortunately for Sakana, it's there. They even have house specials (like salmon smoked on the premises). AWESOME! My only complaint is the lack of fresh wasabi (they have pickled or the powdered stuff).  For the area, this should be 5 stars. I just can't compare it to Kiji in SF or Blue Ribbon in NYC, which are my 5 star benchmarks."
3,"The experience we had was just fine.  Food, service and wine list were all good - salad bar was good too.  I am not sure if I'd go out of my way to go back though.  There are a lot of trendy and fun places to dine in the Scottsdale area and this one seems to be like the ""Grandfather of Scottsdale Dining"" - older and almost antiquated."
4,"In a reasonably late scramble for dinner, this pizza place was quite a find. The location isn't altogether promising, right next to a Circle K and tucked in an itty bitty end in a strip mall. There are only about 7 table. Yet the owner, whose service was excellent, makes the most of the situation.  The wife and I split a margherita pizza. Out first, though, is the appetizer, which was small pieces of pita-like flatbread served with balsamic vinegar served over a tomato and celery salsa cruda. Nom. Worth eating in for.  The pizza itself was a thin crust... The crust was decent, the cheese was good, and both the basil and tomato very fresh. It must be nice having ready access to fresh versions of both year-round! We were very happy with our meal. Pizza A Metro should be on your short list for a good Italian pizza in the area."
5,"I have found my new favorite sushi spot. I wish it was closer to Tempe, but it's worth the drive. You can tell by their menu that Hana strives to be an authentic Japanese restaurant, as opposed to the sake bomber joint that only has food so they can call themselves a restaurant. You know the kind; the Phoenix area is plagued with them. Hana is BYOB, and there are only a few ridiculous fusion rolls on their sushi menu: most of it is authentic, real sushi.  On my first visit I started with my usual appetizers, and was immediately struck by how unusually fresh and tasty they were. The seaweed salad had just the right amount of sesame oil, giving it incredible flavor. The veggie gyoza were indescribably delicious. They made me realize I'd never had a fresh gyoza before; every one I'd eaten previously in my life was a pale imitation of these little bits of Heaven. The sushi came out fast, even though it was fairly busy this particular Thursday. The first thing I noticed, naturally, was that someone put a burning sugar cube on the tray. ""Hey, fire!"" I thought. It was a nice touch. Then I saw, nestled between the flaming sugar and the wad of wasabe, a small pile of what looked like pickle relish. I guessed what it was, and our waitress confirmed it: it was FRESH wasabe. Real, fresh-grated wasabe is something most people never experience. Most people don't even know the pasty green stuff that's standard in every sushi restaurant is just normal horseradish dyed green. The real stuff is just too expensive, and too difficult to keep on hand. But there it was, no extra charge. It adds a little spice and a wonderful, fruity complexity to the sushi.  The sushi was great. They also have a large menu with all the other Japanese dishes you'd expect, but I didn't try any of them. Next time."
3,"This place was just 'eh' to me!  I was just whelmed, not over or under!  The service at the bar leaves little to be desired!  I am not sure what it is about Scottsdale restaurants thinking they have to be snobby to people.  We ordered drinks from an un-friendly bartender and then waited another 20 minutes to even be acknowledged again!   The food was ok!  The bf had the berrimundi which he liked but wasn't wild about the side it came with.  I had the meatloaf, which was good.  The gravy and mashed potatoes had a great creamy flavor.  My sister had the lamb burger with fries that were cold and not very tasteful.  There is not much on the wine list either. I probably would not come back here because I dont think it was worth the hour wait for the crappy service at the bar.  I would rather venture down the road to Olive and Ivy."

My favorite thing to get here is a jumbo baker (and they mean jumbo) with everything on it including a side of chopped beef and then I add their homemade bbq sauce to it. Sooooo good. Their homemade root beer and limeade are also yummy. I remember them having a customer appreciation day once a year (I think in May) where lunch and dinner and free! You would get a pulled pork sandwich, a side and a drink for nothing. The lines would be out the door, but the food is worth the wait. I also remember them offering a free dinner (can't remember the choices) on your birthday. It's a cute little place in downtown Gilbert. Check it out."

The produce, inventory and service are all par but nothing stands out. I recently bought several baked goods from this Bashas for an event. I was on the hunt for sugar cookies that Santa's little elves could decorate during a shopping crawl. They didn't have any out, so I asked the lady behind the counter. She told me they had cookies in the back for a dollar a piece. This was too high for my budget so I politely declined. Then a couple minutes later, she came back and told me they were actually on sale and only $.50, so I decided to buy them. Coincidence that I said no to cookies for a $1 and then they became 50 cents, or just oversight by the employee? Who knows....  During my visit, I also purchased some donuts. I need two dozen donuts and unfortunately they don't have donuts by the dozen pre-made so I ended up making my own. While this is good because you can choose your own, I think it would also be helpful to have pre-made dozens for those in a huge hurry (like I was that day).  In summary, this Bashas is just OK, but I love supporting local so I will continue to shop here!"
5,"If you are looking for TLC in very unique pet products and family style customer service, Posh Pet Boutique and spaW is where you need to go. They have retailed my collection of Decadent Digs there for going on 3 years, since the first day she opened her doors. I have seen her business blossom and become the destination and extra sunshine of the Troon Area. Her loving warmth (sort of Doris Day way) makes you feel like you are in her home and makes want you to come back often. She carries a huge collection of class act merchandise from cute clothes to a killer Kitty high-rise and offers excellent grooming. She is worth the trip."
4,"What a fantastic experience!   If there is a high-end food product that you don't find at whole foods, then you may find yourself to be one of the pickiest eaters known to man.  This place offers everything under the sun.  For the love of God they have almost 30 different types of olives! My family is new to shopping here and we like to splurge a little bit.  For some reason it's comforting to know that there are 4 different kinds of ribeye and what seems to be almost 100 different types of cheeses.  I guess realizing that makes me think that there won't be anything forgotten at Whole Foods.  Unlike Sam's Club, Whole Foods gives samples that actually taste delicious and almost make you grab for seconds when instead you just grab an actual wrapped portion of the product (darn, had to buy some sometime). On a 'grocery store' level, this Whole Foods gets 5 stars that's for sure.  The only reason it gets knocked a star is because some Whole Foods locations offer more services to make their guests feel like it is supposed to be much more than your typical grocery store.  This is a location where I think the patrons would be willing to use everything that they had to offer if given the choice."
3,"This place is fun for drinks. Although, I wouldn't suggest eating here... My friend and I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup. I love tomato soup - even cheap stuff in a can... but what they served us didn't even resemble soup at all! Without any exaggeration, it was literally pizza sauce. I hope it was some sort of mistake... but who does that? Puts straight pizza sauce in a bowl with a spoon? I had been drinking all night and was starving and still couldn't eat it. That being said, the staff here was great and the service was really fast."
