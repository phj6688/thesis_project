1	When I opened the box, I was shocked by the size of this thing... It's TINY! 
1	the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing ! 
0	While the software may not be as easy as I-Tunes, it is not difficult to use by any stretch. 
1	 The DIR-655 was so easy to setup it was almost too easy .
0	3/4 way through the first disk we played on it ( naturally on 31 days after purchase ) the dvd player froze . 
0	The only problem I have with the buttons is that the power button and print/share button don't have a nice click. 
1	Also, multiple picture feature is very, very fast.
0	the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do . 
1	4 ) usb 2.0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ). 
0	 My other big complaint about this monitor is the stand .
0	this product is too fragile for normal use . 
1	 Has a great helpline.
0	I just uninstalled SystemWorks and Internet Security for at least the fifth time due to funtionality issues.
1	This year, it seems that I choose my timing perfectly, having discovered the awesome device that is the Zen Micro.  
1	i 've tried playing all of these discs and they all play great . 
1	And Bluetooth does not drain the battery as quick as I thought it would, I usually can go 1.5 days with Bluetooth on along with making calls before I need a full recharge.
1	This linksys router does it for the RIGHT PRICE. 
1	For looks, well iPod is head and shoulders better, both the iRiver and Creative Zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming iPod. 
1	The guide fence for freehand routing is well made and solid.
0	es, the interface took a little getting used to, but once I did, it's almost second nature now.  
0	got a " system error " problem 30 days after purchase . 
1	t-mobile was a pretty good server . 
1	 the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person , it worked fine , fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it , in fact it works better than my own laptop so I will change to this one as soon as possible
1	I use the router with a 3 1/2in raised panel bit with no problems.
1	great features .. . 
1	Creative has excellent music software, a very responsive tech support group (they are quick on firmware updates, and make them publicly available), and usually a good array of accessories.  
1	the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain . 
1	also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player . 
0	however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality . 
1		 If, like me you simply want an iPod to play your mp3's, buy this one. 
0	first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed . 
1	 The song quality of the iPod is excellent, and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory, for most users.
1	 Seems like a good product .
1	An extra gig of room, FM radio, voice recorder, PIM applications with sync to Outlook. 
0	Again, the headphone jack on this thing is garbage. 
0	 Hopless product , Hopeless Company and Hopeless Customer Support .
1	Wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars.
1	  However after purchasing a 20 GB iPod it's clear to see the superiority. 
1	i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did . 
0	one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work . 
1	at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria . 
0	 More than likely , if you are forking over the money for this router , you have higher needs and expectations , which this router does n't meet .
1	 I have very high praise for the tech support people .
1	Looks and shape: I have a black one and the first time I charged it and switched it on jeez the blue light looked so cool. 
1	And it is very easy to clean.
1	 The range is great , I can list to my radio anywhere in the house .
1	Actually, the Creative Zen Micro solves all that.  
1	 I have this connected to my late 2008 MacBook Pro , and it works flawlessly .
1	I still have my s70 because I like the wider lens sometimes, but in general, if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package, the sd500 is the only one you should buy. 
1	there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc . 
0	 Even when you disable SecureSpot completely , it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is n't and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized .
1	i got this for christmas , and it is a great gift . 
0	 The back of the iPod is in a chrome finish, and this surface is prone to scratches. 
1	- the unit is easy to use and intuitive . 
1	Camera is a paper weight. 
0	 That and for the center speaker , when I mount it on the wall its so top heavy that it falls forward , leaning out about and inch from the wall .
0	 The interface was atrocious ; several elements simply did n't work at all .
1	 The colors and everything are great .
0	Some people have commented about the size and weight of the phone, and it has rightfully gotten the nick-name "the bar of soap" which, it really is.
1	Other mp3 players won't give you the sonic clarity of the Zen at this compression level, so I imagine they won't at lower ones, either. 
1	well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket . 
0	the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset . 
1	1 Speakers at home, I rarely use it with the earbuds, though they are much better than the ones you normally get with other mp3 players.  
0	(It had locked up multiple times previously, but always managed to work afterwards) This time, the touch screen wouldn't respond to me and none of the buttons worked. 
0	i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed . 
1	The camera is adequate and if I want high-res photos I'll use my digital camera instead.
1	honestly , i love this player . 
1	service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great . 
0	I was having intermittent problems with it losing connection. 
1	I have owned some kind of Creative audio product since 1993 and have never had to call tech support.  
0	it's not my first choice in cameras,
1	Most of the other players I checked dont have user servicable battery. 
1	the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes ! 
0	I downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem, but it hasn't worked. 
0	Who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a "foreign" computer just to move over some simple (*.txt) files?  
1	i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it . 
1	The transmission speed is also quite good, with pages loading very quickly.  
1	+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great . 
1	It is Nokia and thus easy to acces the menu options.
0	do n't buy this player . 
1	no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers . 
0	 - Fixed speaker cable -- why do this ?
1	 I got this for use on my truck and I 'm happy with it for the most part , it is loud and super easy to install , however you are going to want an amp for i
1	even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback . 
1	 The range is GREAT - upstairs , downstairs , outside , or in a basement - four bars , all the time .
1	works great ! 
1	this is a wonderful camera . 
1	 The keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable-although it does take some getting used to .
1	The camera is as easy to use as a point and  shoot, and with instant review on the LCD screen, you can retake any  flubbed shots on the spot.
1	You can use the player to store your computer data files (Good feature to have).   
1	 Sound effects really sound more authentic .
1	 From the Belkin my reception increased over 25 % .
0	Finally, I gave up and I purchased a Router Razier.
1	11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player 
0	 I was looking forward to it even if all the other reviews already said it was slow .
1	So, I was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all. 
0	have tried calling ( 866-4apexgo ) , but can 't get through . 
1	 The size is small .
1	Both the antivirus and firewall are integrated into one piece of software and they update together.
1	The two-times optical zoom operates smoothly  and quietly, and lo and behold, a two-piece shutter-like cap automatically  slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off.
0	If you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product, save yourself some money and buy the 2003 version.
1	Excellent diaper disposal unit.
1	It's also easy to empty out.
0	now i know why - they are pieces of junk . 
1	overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it . 
0	P.S.  The only snag I encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the Micro to a front USB port.  The bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power; after connecting it to the rear ports, it works perfectly.     
0	Only problem is that is a bit heavy.
1	 Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .
1	the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures . 
1	the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting . 
1	 This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .
1	Overall this tool is very well worth the price and I have no regrets about my purchase.
0	i will never buy a creative product again . 
0	output went black and white only via both s-video and composite connections , and with no v-hold . 
1	photo stitch (merge pictures to create a panoramic one..even my old one can do this and it's really cool to have it now still)
1	you actually can talk to a real person for support in under an hour!).
1	I did notice if you turn the phone on and off the OS takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the phone has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker.
1	After installation, which was VERY simple....I downloaded any updated software from the Creative website, before I downloaded any music.   
1	In minutes I was easily navigating through the menus.  
0	 A week out of the box and I began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time , growing more frequent each day .
1	Travel with it without knowing you have it in your pocket
0	 I hesitated for so long because of the price .
1	Enjoy.
1	 It does not distort ; video and pictures look great .
1	it's such a great camera! i think it really was worth the investment =)
1	Overall the phones fantastic, and I would have given it 5 stars, but its not perfect.
1	The software has been installed on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP and I haven't had any problems with it.
0	The only main drawback is the fact that the voice-dialing system is kinda picky.
1	excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jvc players . 
1	It is without even a slight doubt, my new favorite.
1	5.  The price is right.
1	 The subwoofer has terrific sound and gets really high !
1	I have had several MP3 players over the past few years, and have to say that this by far is the best that I've owned. 
1	this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it . 
0	The other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of Norton SystemWorks before you installs this.
1	amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping . 
0	While transferring songs to the player, the interface has crashed a few times (4-5 times in a 4-5 hour period) normally this would cause me major concern, but it appears that this bug is reproducible, which leads me to believe that Creative will fix it with a patched version shortly (or maybe it's just my computer). 
0	The zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet.
1	the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it . 
0	It seems like the software is just not responding. 
0	in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % . 
1	Good image quality. 
1	The Diaper Champ is the best we found!
1	Creative has put a lot of effort into making this player appeal to those true geeks that search for coolness and functionality in electronic devices. 
1	Further, the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the Ipod.  
0	 As with most headphones that come with any type of music player,I recommend throwing these into the nearest river, unless you like having hard, round pieces of plastic in your ears. 
1	The use of 65536 (16bit) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phone
1	despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc. . 
1	navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch . 
1	it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop . 
1	the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack . 
1	i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine . 
0	The instant setup button in the front of the router messes up the network it is better to configure the router manually. 
1	- solid , high-quality construction 
0	7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook . 
1	 I do n't for-see myself having any issues with it in the coming year or two however if I do , I will know that with this product , it will be taken care of for free and quick with helpful and courteous customer service reps. The service of Amazon in getting this item to me was faster than I expected and it is exactly what I knew it would be .
1	These include: MP3, Wave, WMA, WMA Pro, and WMA Lossless; it is very user-friendly simply by right-clicking the file(s) to be converted. 
1	 I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .
1	And best of all, no wasting money on special refill bags---this takes ordinary garbage bags!
1	The first thing I did was upgrade the firmware to the version required for WMP10, it syncs flawlessly with Media Player and transfers are fast.  
1	the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen . 
0	 If you are not picky about image quality , go for it .
0	as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away ! 
0	Being a past Norton customer, I consider this to be a slap to my face.
0	i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual . 
1	a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality . 
1	you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed . 
0	the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive . 
1	I do not need to repeat what's great about this phone.
1	(every now and then I spray down the inside of the pail with Lysol) *easy one-hand use *impossible for my inquisitive child to get the dirty diapers OUT of the pail Every now and then odors do escape the pail, but that is rare--and it usually just means that we've crammed too much in there and need to change the bag.
1	the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to . 
0	it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs , it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies . 
1	just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance . 
0	I had tried to uninstall Norton Internet Security a few weeks ago, and it wouldn't let me do that either.
0	 Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .
1	The color and light I captured with this camera on a 12-day trip to Turkey (gorgeous vividly colored ceramic tiles inside darkened mosques) were far superior to anything I've ever gotten with a traditional 35-mm film camera.
0	my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them . 
1	battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours . 
1	It's good.
1	I didn't have any major problems installing this software.
1	the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) . 
0	rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . . 
0	it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait . 
0	I can't tell you how many times i've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it.
1	 JBL S310 II is truly amazing .
1	it practically plays almost everything you give it . 
0	the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as : 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd . 
0	I added a crank for those times when I  need to make fine adjustments, but I seldom use it.
1	 The system was nowhere near stable , and the code was in `` alpha '' stage at best .
0	 In that regard , I am still having difficulty attempting to get the SharePort Utility to function normally .
1	Sound  I'm no audiophile but I was amazed by the clarity the player had, it was much better than the sound card on my Computer and louder too. 
1	What I really like about- its quite, it can handle my workload and it was so cheap that I can throw it away and buy another one without blinking.
1	Love the speaker phone.
0	I don't know what's happened to Norton, but 2004 is absolute garbage.
1	i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far . 
1	New firmware update allows for automatic wireless network configuration. 
0	the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player . 
0	the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly . 
1	the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly . 
1	i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood . 
1	the earbuds that come with it are n't that bad . 
1	 If you want background music , better than your TV sound for movies , speakers around the house for parties , outside get togethers , this is about as good as you can expect , for the price .
1	another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera.
1	one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) . 
1	A Digic II-powered image-processing system enables the SD500 to snap a limitless stream of 7-megapixel photos at a respectable clip, its start-up time is tops in its class, and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition. 
1	 : P Fantastic little computer , does everything I had hoped for work\/study\/travel .
0	My first router is a safety hazard if you do not pay attention and are not very careful.
1	5- Excelent software package.
0	 No Memory Stick slots-- Although a rare feature, it would be nice to have extra storage, not that it needs it Built-in Lithium Battery-- A huge hassle to bring this back; draining the battery once you get it helps, but removable/replaceable ones are a lot more convenient
0	I took my Zen Micro with me over the weekend, and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason: to keep the Zen Micro charged. 
1	If anyone is thinkning of getting an ipod mini, forget it and go with this player. 
1	on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured . 
0	flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost . 
0	 I sent my monitor in to Acer for repairs for such a small but very problematic problem of random Buzzing from my Acer GD235Hz monitor .
1	ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n't even gotten to all of them yet . 
1	the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . ) 
1	I've taken about hundred shot with the Canon, in varying lighting situations, all in auto mode, and not one blurry picture!!! 
1	overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it . 
0	 battery life is not long enough IF and ONLY IF you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times...the camera/battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it's normal. 
1	 Overall , I like the system features and performance .
1	I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags.
1	 No dead pixels on mine .
1	 The images are vivid and crisp , the text and fonts are very clear .
1	All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price.
1	 I have about 6 gb used on my iPod so far (well over 1000 songs), and as far as I can tell, all of them play at near-cd quality.
0	 The subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned ALL THE WAY DOWN , but it 's all right because these are computer speakers .
1	1.  The Diaper Champ doesn't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find!
0	The karma is only $5 more, it's small, had a 20 gig drive and supports more formats including ogg.  
1	this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made . 
1	This camera is truely superb.
1	battery life is good for a phone of this size . 
0	The machine itself seems fine, but the software that came with it is AWFUL. 
1	I have been impressed with the power of the Hitachi M12V.
0	Speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifaces the battery life.
1	No vibration!
0	My file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites.
1	 Best tech support I have ever experienced .
1	Otherwise, this is a great "alternative" MP3 player for those of use who don't want to worship the mighty all-powerful Apple. 
1	pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery 
1	i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it . 
1	Good sound-- Plays very nicely, even though the stock headphones are kind of weak Durable-- not the most durable because its mostly plastic, but very compact and sturdy 
1	great screen and great sound . 
1	 These INSTEN `` Folding Speakers '' are a surprisingly good value for decent quality portable speakers !
1	I work on word, explorer, netscape, acrobat reader, photoshop at same time (meaning using a lot of memory), but still dont see a problem with computer (getting slow or crashing).
1	I've printed several photos and the prints look as good as the screen views.
0	Don't use them, so I delete them for addtl space.
0	 There 's also no height adjustability , so it sits very low to the desk .
1	 UPDATE Jan 12 , 2012 The device has worked flawlessly for the past year .
0	well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise . 
1	This router does everything that it is supposed to do, so i dont really know how to talk that bad about it. 
1	 The sound quality is really good .
1	navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too . 
0	Also much less stinky.
0	 CUSTOMER SERVICE: Awful. Listen to this one, remember the battery statement I made earlier. 
1	Sound quality is great, fm tuner is fine, as is the recorder.  
1	while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player . 
0	Cranking the master volume level up past the mark of the bar only leads to distortion and compromised sound quality. 
0	 The router does n't support port translation , e.g forward port 8080 in the outside to port 80 in the inside .
1	I have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright.  
1	i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision . 
1	it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to . 
1	while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it . 
0	While I was trying to play Half Life 2 it started popping up with "alerts" every twenty seconds (literally), warning me my antivirus protection was off.
1	it is n't big and offensive , though you would n't know it by looking at the pics it takes . 
0	however , it has failed to deliver on quality . 
1	Compatability with other devices is excellent too; I've only found one 11b device that won't work with its mixed mode (and it won't work with *anyone's* mixed mode).
1	Using supplied s/w, you can transfer all addresses from a different nokia phone into it.
1	the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise . 
0	the remote is a little hard to understand . 
1	i just bought this player today and i already love it . 
0	crappy headphones . 
0	 The switch being in the back is a little awkward as the other reviews also mention and the `` pulse '' is n't really all that but that is irrelevant to me .
1	 Fits nicely on the small desk we use in our computer room .
1	This phone is one of the best I've ever used.
0	4- My idea was that it was an all-in-one , and that theory -once again- proves wrong , this phone excells at nothing , less  than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the "other than phone" functionalities , you'll be disappointed .... if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine .... but don't expect to get much done .
1	One: It's size: It's smaller than the Ipod Mini, and holds more music (5GB to the IPOD mini's 4GBs). 
0	Was a bit wary because the software is Windows only and I have an iMac. 
1	Speed is not a problem.      
1	it 's easy . 
1	without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image ! 
1	3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing . 
1	Capacity is not a problem here.
1	 PLEASE A firmware upgrade that enables all the usb drives attached to this wireless router to be seen in the actual networked local computer desktop portals AND be able to drag and drop , upload , attach , etc. .
0	However, I suspect that many people are having a bad experience -- DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.
0	the software , which comes with player is not good at all . 
1	this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size . 
0	I really regret signing up with T-Mobile, but I'm stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract.
0	 No one sells a 1.2 mm x 2.2 mm sized -LRB- or what ever stupid size it is -RRB- power adapter .
1	very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price . 
0	Unfortunately , I sold it exactly a month later .
1	 I 'm not a person well read in technology but this is just an absolutely wonderful computer .
1	I was worried about what the sound quality would be like, but that seems to be just as good as the actual CD sound.
1	 It came well-packaged .
0	But this doesn't make up for it's innumerable other short-comings, the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with LiveUpdate.
1	I love the features, the interface, the size (the screen is a delight), the camera (though I admit I'm not much of a camera user -- so just a toy for me), the internet connectivity, the quality, etc.
1	I just went on a quick photo shoot in NYC's  Central Park today, and what a bunch of beautiful photos I took, if I do  say so myself (and I do!)
0	the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that " creates " folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best . 
1	I'm sure you can read the specs above to see everything it does, but for me the best thing is that I can easily check my email, movie times, news, or any website with this phone.
0	You have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost. 
1	The manual is excellent. 
1	 This is the best sound system I have ever heard .
1	took hundreds of pictures and they were great . 
1	At any rate, if you have been interested in  digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back,  consider the Canon S100 Digital Elph.
0	namely, it wouldnt sync.
0	who in the hell needs a frigging *VGA* camera on their CELLPHONE???
1	 Once I turn up the volume a touch , they sound really good .
1	the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly . 
1	And it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained, which the diaper genie never did!
1	this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it . 
0	Only slight negatives I've had so far is that I haven't been able to get it to accept any of my WAV files yet.  
1	All I have to say is that the pics I get with my SD500 are both rich and color and high in detail, the user interface is awesome, the battery charger is tiny and super light and SD cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time.
0	i 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response . 
1	 It worked perfectly for about a week , then the problems came .
1	If you can get one with all the accessories and a cheap extended warranty, this is the player to get! Highly recommended.     
1	 We are well pleased with the monitor and the company .
1	autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all . 
1	It holds plenty of songs. 
1	No down time, great signal strength.  
0	I have to move pictures off of it every day so I have room for more pictures the next, and I don't have enough money to buy the 256 MEG card that I've had my eye on for a while.
1	Don't care about sunlight: it's TFT.
0	the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating . 
0	the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . ) 
1	in general it is easy to use and well laid out . 
1	) One outstanding positive feature is the battery. It holds a charge for a long time, longer than most other similar products and the user can replace it easily or take another along as a backup. 
1	when you learn how to change some settings, you can make the quality even better 
0	so now it still plays everything , you just can 't see it ! 
1	i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality . 
0	It is the 'first generation' of the player, and while I still agree that it is a great alternative to the iPod, I think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck.   
0	This is definitely one of those products, especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit.
0	first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes . 
1	The Diaper Champ is so simple that my toddler loves to put his own diapers in the diaper champ and flip over the handle.
0	i can 't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good . 
1	 Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .
1	The height adjustment works well- not perfect.
0	On the plus side it's packed with features, including BlueTooth that works fine - it's really a tiny computer that is also a phone... and that's the negative.
0	We found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader, there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used.
1	 These are the only computer speakers I 've ever bought so I have no comparison to anything else .
1	overall i like it . 
1	it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package . 
0	 Expensive , but for us -- well worth it .
1	 I 'd venture to say that because of it 's low cost it 's the best PC stereo set out there costwise .
1	a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always . 
0	I don't know, maybe I got a defective one but first, the player would not shut off, next, the player would not come on - I had to send it away to get repaired.  
1	 Nice and compact .
1	For the Zen Creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out, well presented and easy to open and put back together.  
0	Knocked 1 star off for the install wizard - it wasted alot of time running it.     
0	The Adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with XP so you are forced to create your document then either print it from Windows or export it to another application.
0	 Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!
1	i like the automatic key lock function . 
1	 The colors and viewing angle are about average , but a huge upgrade from the truly terrible quality of the other monitor .
1	 However , you DO get what you pay for in reliable products .
1	ying to point out they have experience, and so the reliability of the connection you get is among the best.  
1	4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome . 
1	m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray ! 
1	This holds alot and does not take up alot of space.
1	it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep . 
0	no line out jack - as i said , there is none . 
1	We really enjoyed shooting with the Canon PowerShot SD500. 
0	 This product did not work at all .
1	 These a great speakers - full of sound .
0	but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on ithave a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments . 
0	Respectable, solid, but not awe-inspiring.          
1	sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features . 
1	update : the finish is more " mirror " than silver -- and i like it ! 
1	It's shorter, sleeker, more compact and fits comfortably in my small hand than the iPod...My Nokia cell phone towers over this bad boy! 
1	Works great!!!!
0	 Unfortunately my Verizon 3G signal strength where I live is very weak -LRB- 1-2 bars -RRB- so I could n't get much more than 1 Mbps download speed but I will test this again when I am in a location with decent signal strength .
1	 Pros : - Great sound for a $ 100 speaker at mid to higher levels .
1	The edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well.
0	I already knew something was wrong, because much of the Spam I've seen in the past six months was from resellers of Norton products.
0	it had a heavier and more sturdy casing . 
1	i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it . 
1	another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying . 
1	 Very easy to set up .
0	the software sucks . 
1	all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player . 
0	the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this -- 
1	Being a very economical person, I appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system- I never did like the prospect of buying special Diaper Genie refills.
0	wo n't play a lot of discs . 
0	) -Can't be left in the car... it immediately shuts down with an overheating error if left in a hot car for too long. 
0	I have trashed this product on other opinion sites based on this major flaw alone. 
1	The Micro seeemed like an iPod for less. 
1	It has plenty of power.
1	 Amazing speed and easy to set up .
1	I love the performance and features of this router.
1	 And it works great too !
1	The Zen Micro (mine's black) has a lot going for it.   
1	There are extra features packed inside this unit (some that most will hardly ever use) such as FM radio tuner, voice recorder, calendar, and alarm clock. 
1	There seem to be fewer collisons and dropped packets as I read from the router logs than with my old Dlink router. 
1	 Worked fine after that .
0	one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low . 
1	at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod . 
0	 The data rate over the network storage is rather slow , but I only use it for occasional backups so it does n't bother me too much .
1	I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
1	It is quiet and has plenty of power.
1	 I 'm very happy with this router , and would recommend it .
0	the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with . 
1	 Beautiful home theater and music speaker ... crisp highs , defined mids , and respectable bass .
1	Well the Champ has survived it's first year with our son and it is great!!
1	 I was pleasantly surprised that customer service was able to step me thru manual setup .
1	by the way , it looks nice also . 
0	I was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work, to no avail. 
0	I finally got a free support number for Norton through my ISP support staff, but waited an hour or more for a voice.
1	it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid . 
1	  Comments: Overall this is still a great value, but is kind of overrated in the sense that there are beater deals on the market.
1	 So far , I am super happy with this small yet powerful enough laptop .
1	I recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers.
0	its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket . 
1	 Setup is simple and it worked right out of the box .
1	  With accessories, you can make the iPod into a digital recorder, broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology, and play it through your car speakers using either a CD adaptor or FM stereo broadcaster. 
1	the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen . 
0	1) It is perhaps too small. 
1	On the fly play list creation, address book, removable storage drive capabilities, sound recorder, the list goes on people, this thing is literally so chalked full of goodies, it was like Halloween all over again. 
0	They have the worst service of any of the major companies.
1	 Set up WPA with no problems .
1	It is a nice router in all ways but one.  
1	The more I use it and figure out how to do things, the more I like it.     
0	other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack . 
1	Camera quality isn't bad for the low resolution.
1	 I am very happy with the Acer 19-inch flat screen monitor which I received for Christmas .
0	weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names ; you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc. ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] . 
0	the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile . 
0	My daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor.
1	player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play . 
1	not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want . 
1	I discovered that the camera has a manual mode that gives you total control over exposure, white balance, flash (red eye, person against bright background, flash on, flash off, flash automatic).
1	Nice things about the M12V: - in a table, the powerful 3 1/4 HP motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - Amazon's price
0	I am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the "sliding wrench" which comes on the router.
1	 All I can say is that this is an excellent devise .
0	the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint . 
0	This product is absolutely not ready for release.
0	i dont especially like how music files are unstructured; basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization, like you might have in windows explorer folders and subfolders.  
1	In low light with flash I found it clear better then the sony P200 (too much red, colours overall not as natural but fewer red-eyes). 
0	To eliminate any smells we simple stuck a Stick Up room deodorizer inside the lid.
1	the setup and transfer process was cake for me . 
1	i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse : 
1	The diaper champ is the best!
1	the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) . 
1	 The monitor works very well with a sharp and bright display .
0	one bad thing though , i find the remote-control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does . 
1	This isn't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this,are you.
0	This doesn't affect standard MP3 files - just subscription WMA files. 
1	 VERY fast delivery .
0	mediasource did not recognize my tags ! 
0	Now this router is not the cheapest on the market.  
1	 However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .
1	I ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because I change him so often downstairs.
1	The battery life is less than stellar, but it charges w/ the quickness.
0	 Now when the backlight fails , I have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day .
1	the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc. 
1	The card basically installed itself and the "install wizard" on the CD that came with the router basically set the router up to work with one computer (with the 54g card) and also a second computer in my house (with an 11b card).
